      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nor have I any where receded from the more general ſence of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters in the Explication of any Text or Paſſage of Scripture, but onely, where either the expreſs ſignification of words, or the vergency (or rather indeed, urgency) of the Context, or ſome repugnancy to the expreſſneſs of Scripture elſewhere, or elſe ſome pregnant inconſiſtency with ſome clear
<pb facs="tcp:94900:4"/> Principle, either of Religion, or ſound Reaſon, neceſſitated me unto it. Yea I ſeldom upon any of theſe accounts leave the common road of Interpreters, but I finde that ſome or other, one or more, of the moſt intelligent of them have troden the ſame path before me. And for the moſt part <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancient Expoſitors, and <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf among the Modern, are my Companions in the paths of my greateſt ſolitarineſs. Concerning the main Doctrine avouched in the Diſcourſe, wherein the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> no particular perſon, or member hereof excepted, is held forth and aſſerted, I demonſtrate by many Teſtimonies from the beſt Records of Antiquity, to have been the <hi>Oecumenical</hi> ſence of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World in her primitive and pureſt Times. Nor am I conſcious to my ſelf (I ſpeak as in the preſent of God) of any the leaſt miſtake, either in word, or meaning, of any Author or Teſtimony cited by me throughout the whole Diſcourſe: nor yet of any omiſſion in point of diligence or care, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of all miſtakes in either kinde.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſe, ſuch as it is, with all Reſpects of Honor and Love I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto you; not requiring any thing from you by way of countenance or approbation, otherwiſe then upon thoſe equitable terms, on which <hi>Auguſtus</hi>

               </gap> thereof, by taking away with an hand of Light and potency of Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thoſe weapons, whether Texts of Scriptures, or Grounds in Reaſon, wherein you will finde by the Diſcourſe it ſelf that we put our truſt. Your <hi>Conteſtation</hi> upon theſe terms, will be of a reſentment with me more precious and accepted, then your <hi>Atteſtation,</hi> in caſe of your comport in Judgment with me: though I ſhall ingenuouſly confeſs, and profeſs, that for the Truths ſake, even in this alſo I ſhall greatly rejoyce. Notwithſtanding I judg it much more (of the two) richly conducing to the dear Intereſt of my Peace and Safety, to be delivered from my Errors, then to receive countenance and approbation from men in what I hold, or teach, according to the Truth.</p>
            <p>If nothing which is here pleaded, whether from the Scriptures, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſhall be able to over-rule your Judgments into an acknowledgment of Truth in the main Doctrine contended for, in which caſe you will (I truſt) though not with reſpect to my Requeſt in that behalf, yet for the Truths ſake, and for your own Intereſts ſake, as well in the things of this World, as of that which is to come, declare your ſelves in ſome worthy and ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Particulars here propounded; I ſhall not need (I preſume) to deſire you, that in your Anſwer you will not riſe up in your might againſt the weaker, looſer, or leſs-conſiderate Paſſages or Expreſſions (of which kind you may very poſſibly meet with many more then enough) but that you will rather bend the ſtrength of your Reply, againſt the ſtrength of what you ſhall oppoſe (at leaſt if there be any thing herein worthy ſuch a title.) You well know, that a Field may be won, though many Soldiers of the conquering ſide ſhould fall, or be wounded, in the Battel: and that a Tree may flouriſh, and retain both its beauty, and firmneſs of ſtanding in the Earth, though many of the ſmaller twigs, or leſſer branches ſhould prove dry and ſere, and ſo be eaſily
<pb facs="tcp:94900:5"/> broken off. So may a Mountain remain unmoved, yea and unmovable, though many handfuls of the lighter and looſer earth about the ſides of it, ſhould be taken up and ſcattered into the ayr like duſt. In like manner the main Body of a Diſcourſe may ſtand entire in its ſolidity, weight, and ſtrength, though many particular Expreſſions, Sayings, and Reaſonings therein, that are more circumferential, and remote from the center, ſhould be detected either of inconſiderateneſs, weakneſs, or untruth. Yea in ſome caſes one Argument or Plea may be ſo triumphantly pregnant and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that though many others of the ſame engagement ſhould be defeated, yet the cauſe protected by it may upon a very ſober and juſtifiable account, laugh all oppoſition of contrary arguings to ſcorn. I acknowledg there are ſome Expreſſions and Paſſages in the enſuing Diſcourſe (as in Cap. 1. Sect. 9. and elſewhere) which upon the review, I my ſelf apprehend obnoxious enough to exception: yea and which, had my ſecond thoughts been born in due time, ſhould have been ſomewhat better ſecured. But I truſt that ancient Law of indulgence in ſuch caſes as mine (which very probably may be ſome of your own alſo) is of Authority ſufficient in your Common-wealth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me:</p>

You know that that great Enemy of the Peace and Salvation of men, who of old taught the Enemies of God to put his Saints into Bears skins, and Wolves skins, ſo preparing them to be torn in peeces and devoured by Dogs, hath in theſe latter times ſecretly inſinuated and prevailed with many of the children of God themſelves, to put many of his Truths, ſuch as they like not, or comprehend not, into Names of Ignominy and Reproach, to draw others into the ſame hatred and defamation of them with themſelves. I have ſomewhere obſerved, that this method of confuting and ſuppreſsing Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, againſt which men have had no competent grounds of Eviction other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, was at firſt invented by the ſubtil Sons of the Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi>

            <p>The truth is, that you have no ſuch temptation upon you, as particular and private men have, to flee to any ſuch polluted Sanctuary, as that menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, to ſave your Names and Reputations from the hand of any Opinion or Doctrine whatſoever. For you ſo far (I preſume) underſtand your Intereſt and Prerogative, that for matters of Opinion and Doctrine, you are inveſted with an autocratorical <hi>majeſty,</hi> like that, which was ſometimes given unto <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> over men: <hi>whom he would, he ſlew: and whom he would, he kept alive: whom he would, he ſet up; and whom he would, he put down</hi>

If you will juſtifie, who are they that will not be afraid to condemn? if you condemn, who will juſtifie? Only Gods eldeſt Daughter, <hi>Truth,</hi> hath One mightier then you on her ſide, who will juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her in due time, though you ſhould condemn her: and will raiſe her up from the dead the third day, in caſe you ſhall ſlay her. However, if the Doctrine commended in the Diſcourſe now preſented unto you, ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it ſelf in your eyes alſo, for a Truth, far be it from you to hide your faces from it, becauſe at preſent it labors and ſuffers reproach in the World, conſidering that you may very ſuddenly take away the reproach, and partake your ſelves of that Honor, which you ſhall caſt upon it. Should ſuch an Univerſity as you fear the reproach of ſtanding by a Truth? <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is not aſhamed of the Bodies of his Saints, living, or dead, though in both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions vile and contemptible in the eyes of men, knowing that he hath power in his hand to cloath them with glory and immortality, when he pleaſeth, and that this glory, when veſted in them, will be an high augmentation of his own.</p>
            <p>Brethren, unto you I may truly ſay (with <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>Philippians</hi>) that <hi>I have you in my heart</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Philip. 1. 7</note>. I can look upon you with an eye of good hope, as a generation of men anointed by God with a ſpirit of Wiſdom, Knowledg, Zeal, and Faithfulneſs, to bring on the New Heavens, and the New Earth, wherein Righteouſneſs ſhall dwell, and this by repairing the breaches and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed places in the Body of the Doctrine of Chriſtian Religion, which, ſince the firſt raiſing and compleating of it by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, partly through the ignorance and inſufficiency, partly through the oſcitancy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſneſs of thoſe, to whom the guardianſhip and cuſtody thereof have been committed by God in their ſucceſſive generations, hath been lamentably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled, miſ-figured, and defaced, and this well-nigh in all the integral and principal parts of it (more or leſs:) In ſo much that a man who truly and clearly apprehends what this Doctrine was (and yet is in her purity, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive frame) and ſhall compare it with the Syſteme or Body of Divinity, which under this Notion is commonly taught and held forth amongſt us, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be able to ſay, <hi>this is the Doctrine of Chriſt.</hi> For whoſoever ſhall engage himſelf with that diligence, throughneſs, and unpartialneſs of Enquiry, which become thoſe, who run for ſo high a prize as an incorruptible Crown of Glory, to conſider what is ordinarily delivered, and more generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, amongſt us, not onely in, and about, thoſe great Points of Election, Reprobation, Redemption, the efficacy and extent of the Grace of God, and Perſeverance of the Saints; but alſo about many other Heads of Chriſtian Doctrine, as about Faith, Juſtification, the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Repentance, Good Works, Baptiſm, the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Dead until the Reſurrection (with ſundry more) and ſhall with like diligence conſider what the Scriptures teach concerning theſe Particulars reſpectively, will clearly and diſtinctly ſee, that though <hi>Chriſt</hi> be not ſo ill formed, amongſt us, in ſome of theſe Doctrines, as he is in others, yet he is repreſented very unlike, and much beneath himſelf, in them all.

            <p>This (I preſume) I ſhould do effectually, if I were able (in the firſt place) to poſſeſs thee throughly with a true Notion of the danger of Error, and miſ-apprehenſion in the things of God: Secondly, with the deep and ſolemn neceſſity which lieth upon all perſons of Mankinde without exception, who are endued with Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, to engage theſe worthy and noble Faculties to their uttermoſt, about the things of God, and matters of Salvation: and laſtly, with the innocency and inoffenſiveneſs of the Doctrines maintained in the preſent Diſcourſe, in respect of thoſe vulgar Imputations, which by way of prejudice, are layd to their charge.

            <p>For the firſt: Truth, especially in things of a ſupernatural concernment, the knowledg<note place="margin">The danger of Error in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious import.</note> whereof faceth Eternity, and without which (in ſome competent degree) no perſon (capable of it) can, or will, be judged by God, <hi>meet to partake with the Saints in the inheritance of light,</hi> being nothing elſe (interpretatively) but God himſelf prepared, of, and by, himſelf, for a beatifical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and from hence, with the heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, Error in things of this high and ſacred import, can be nothing elſe but Satan, the Great Enemy of the Peace and Bleſſedneſs of Men, contriving and diſtilling himſelf into a Notion, or Impreſſion, apt and likely to be entertained and admitted by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, under the appearance, and in the name, of Truth, into union with it ſelf, and by means hereof, into union alſo with the Heart and Soul of Men. Much in ſuch a ſence, as that wherein the Apostle affirmeth, <hi>meats</hi> to be <hi>for the belly, and the belly</hi> again <hi>for meats</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 13</note>, is Truth for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding for Truth. And in ſuch a ſence, as poyſoned or unwholeſom meats, are not, nor ever were intended by God, for the belly, nor the belly for them; it may truly be ſaid, that Error is not, nor was ever intended by God, for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding, nor the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding for Error. Truth, or God iſſuing and ſtreaming out his moſt excellent and incomprehenſible Nature and Being, his infinite Wiſdom, knowledg, Power, Goodneſs, Bounty, Mercy, Juſtice, &amp;c. in certain Poſitions, Notions, and apprehenſions, is of the moſt natural, kindly, and ſoveraign accommodation for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstandings of men (and dependently hereupon, for their hearts and affections alſo) that can be imagined. So that the belly is not, in the low way of Nature appropriate unto it, better, or more naturally provided for and ſatisfied, when filled with the best, and beſt nouriſhing meats; nor the body, or reſt of the members, in a more ready, natural, and certain way of well-doing naturally, whileſt the nouriſhment of theſe meats lasteth, and is regularly dispenſed from the belly unto them, then the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of a man is, when inveſted, enriched, filled with ſupernatural and Divine Truth; and whileſt the knowledg and due conſideration hereof there abideth, as far as the influence and ſphere of the activeneſs of it extend, the Heart, Soul, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Men alſo are hereby enriched and filled with their appropriate Treaſures of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Holineſs, Joy, and Peace. Whereas Error, and all Miſ-notions of God, his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Attributes, Counſels, or Ways, though the Minde and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of a man may rejoyce over them for a ſeaſon, yet do they all this while pollute, corrupt, and imbaſe them by their union and communion with them; as a perſon of a noble houſe and blood ſtains his honor and reputation, by coupling himſelf in marriage with a woman of baſe parentage, and conditions. Yea all Error (of that kinde whereof I now ſpeak) being ſeated in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, ſecretly and by degrees infuſeth a proportionable malignity into the Will and affections, and occaſioneth ſinful diſtempers, unholy and unworthy dispoſitions, to put forth here. The truth is that Error is the great Troubler of the World: it is that fountain of Death that iſſueth and ſendeth out all thoſe bitter waters, and ſtreams of ſin
<pb facs="tcp:94900:7"/> and unrighteouſneſs in every kinde, which overflow the Earth (almoſt) in every place and part of it, making it ſo extreamly barren of Comfort and Peace, as it is, yea and as the ſhadow of Death to the Inhabitants of it. Why do men ſo univerſally walk, in ways of Oppreſſion, Extortion, Deceit, Covetouſneſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmercifulneſs, Dru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kenneſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Envy, Hatred, Pride, Ambition, &amp;c. but becauſe they judg ſuch ways as theſe, all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered, more commodious and deſirable unto them, then ways and practices of a contrary, that is, of an holy and truly-honorable import? And what is this but a moſt ſtupendious and horrid Error and mistake, being the natural reſult of thoſe numberleſs, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and lying apprehenſions and conceits concerning God, wherewith men willingly ſuffer their mindes and conſciences to be imbaſed, and corrupted, even to a ſpiritual rottenneſs and putrifaction? For when God ſhall pleaſe to heal the World of all the malignity, that yet boyls and works in the bowels of it, and breaks out upon all occaſions to the great annoyance and diſcontent of men, the receit which he will adminiſter unto it in order hereunto, is onely the knowledg of himſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the truth of his Nature, Attributes, and tranſcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Being. This is the Word of Promiſe, which came long ſince from the mouth of God himſelf unto the World: <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain: FOR the Earth ſhall be FULL OF THE KNOVVLEDG OF THE LORD, as the waters cover the Sea</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Iſai. 11. 9</note>: clearly implying, that when ignorance, and all misperſwaſions concerning God in the world, ſhall be led captive by the light of the knowledg of the Truth, and when there ſhall be a good underſtanding begotten between him, and his Creature, the hearts of men will ſerve them no longer to rebel againſt him, or to despiſe his Law. So that what is commonly ſaid of Knowledg, may truly be ſaid of God; <hi>non habet inimicum praeter ignorantem;</hi> he hath no Enemy, but onely thoſe who know him not. The Devil had no door to open effectual enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which to give ſin an entrance into the World, but onely the perverting of the ſtreight thoughts and apprehenſions of God, which God himſelf had planted in the Minde and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of his Creature, Man. The Woman had a right and ſound perſwaſion of the juſt ſeverity, and Truth of God in his threatenings, until <hi>Satan</hi> prevailed with her to change it for a lye <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 3. 4, 5</note>: into the ſpirit of which lye <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf alſo was preſently baptized by her confidence under it. Neither could the Devil have touch'd either the one, or the other of them, but by the mediation of ſome erroneous Notion or other, concerning God. And as Satan brought ſin into the World by the opportunity of a miſrepreſentation of God unto his Creature: ſo when God ſhall pleaſe to Reform the World, and make a perfect ejection of ſin out of it, he will do it by repairing the breaches which <hi>Satan</hi> hath made upon the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of men, with a clear light of the knowledg of himſelf. Well may the Holy Ghoſt call ſin and wickedneſs in every kinde, the <hi>works of darkneſs,</hi> becauſe they are never practiſed, but by the illegal warrant, and blinde direction, of ſome falſe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or other in the mindes of men. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this account alſo it is, that the Apoſtle interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the building of <hi>timber, hay, and ſtubble [i. e.</hi> unſound Doctrines, and Opinions] upon the true Foundation, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to be a <hi>corrupting</hi> [or deſtroying] of the <hi>Temple of God</hi>

For God, in whatſoever he revealeth, or ſpeaketh in his Word, of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency with an Error (and Error there is none about ſpiritual things, in oppoſition whereunto God ſpeaketh not more or leſs in his Word) muſt needs be as a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> or one that ſpeaketh with an unknown tongue, to him whoſe Minde and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd with it. When our Saviour told his Diſciples (in words expreſs, and plain enough) that <hi>the Son of man ſhould be delivered into the hands of men,</hi> (Luk. 9. 44. &amp; 18. 34.) it is ſaid, that <hi>they</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>underſtood not the ſaying.</hi> The Reaſon plainly was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were erroneouſly principled about the ſubject, of which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake, which was his eſtate of Humiliation by ſuffering Death; they ſuppoſing and taking it for granted, that he was to be a great Potentate and Monarch in the World, without paſſing through the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of an ignominious Death thereunto. In like manner when he ſaid to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his Mother, <hi>Wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my Fathers buſineſs</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Luke 2. 49</note>, the Text ſaith, that <hi>they underſtood not the ſaying that he ſpake unto them.</hi> The reaſon of their <hi>non-underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94900:8"/> in this caſe, was becauſe they were under the command of ſuch a ſuppoſition, which thwarted that principle, according to the exigency whereof he ſo ſpake. They ſuppoſed that he was under no engagement, in no due capacity, at least at thoſe years, which at this time he had attained, to manage the great affairs of God and his Kingdom, in the World: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his ſence was, that he was under the one, and in the other; and ſpake accordingly unto them.

               <note n="g" place="margin">Acts 26. 24</note>, (implying, that he could make neither ſap nor ſence, of what he had ſaid) was becauſe the tenor and ſubſtance of <hi>Pauls</hi> Diſcourſe was diametrally oppoſite to his Principles. After the ſame manner, when and whileſt a mans Judgment is perverted by any unſound Opinion, that hath taken faſt hold on it, he is uncapable of all that light of Truth, which God ſhineth in the Scriptures in oppoſition to that Error, and muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, either relinquiſh this Opinion, or elſe, either deprave and miſ-understand the Minde of God in all ſuch paſſages, or elſe profeſs diſſatisfaction touching the true ſence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.

The Reaſon is, becauſe neither of them have any Principle ſymbolical with the other: the thoughts of men are not the thoughts of beaſts: neither are the thoughts or impreſſions of beasts, the thoughts of men. And though men being ſound in ſome ſoveraign Principles of the Gospel, and ſuch which are (as it were) the life-guard of the heart and vital parts of Religion, may poſſibly live in communion with God upon terms conſiſtent with Salvation; yet may they very poſſibly alſo, in caſe they be intangled with Error otherwiſe, by means hereof ſuffer loſs to a very ſad degree in the things of their preſent peace. When the Sun is in the greatest Eclipſe that is lightly incident to it, there yet ſhineth ſo much Light to the World, which is ſufficient to make it day, and whereby to perform ordinary works wont to be done in the day time: notwithſtanding during ſuch an Eclipſe as this, the World, through want of that fulneſs of light, which that worthy Creature, the Sun, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally affordeth, ſuffereth many degrees of the damp and ſadneſs of the night. In like maner, though the light of Gods countenance may ſhine in the face of the Soul to ſuch a degree, as to make a day of Grace and favorable acceptance with him, notwithſtanding the interpoſition of a dark cloud of many Errors; yet moſt certain it is that according to the compaſs and proportion of ſuch a cloud, and during the interpoſition of it, the Soul will be apt to ſuffer now and then many grudgings and ſad impreſſions of a fear of being rejected by him. There is no ray or beam which naturally ſhineth from the face of God, but the interception, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and want of it muſt needs prove both <hi>poena damni,</hi> yea and <hi>poena ſenſus</hi> too, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, unto the Soul.

Luſts and ſinful diſtempers can be no where ingendred, but onely in the dark regions of the Soul: the ſhining of the light of the Truth, is as the ſhadow of Death unto them. Nor can fear that hath torment, nor any afflicting or ſad impreſſion upon the ſpirits of men, climb up into the bed of the Soul, to diſturb the reſt and ſweet peace of it, but onely in the night of Ignorance, and by the opportunity of Error lodging there.

            <p>The time would fail me to ſpeak at large of all the ſad retinue of Evils and Miſchiefs that attend upon Error. Take in brief the ſum, as well of what I have ſaid, as what I would willingly ſay yet further, upon this account.</p>
            <p>First: It hath been ſaid, that Error defileth and embaſeth the perſon, who coupleth his Judgment with it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it obſtructeth communion with God, as far as the malignity of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it extendeth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the proper and direct tendency of it, is unto death, to bring everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon the Soul.</p>

               </gap>wed, that Error is the proper Element for <hi>Jim</hi> and <hi>Ojim,</hi> and doleful creatures, I mean, for fears, ſad apprehenſions, diſconſolate thoughts, on the one hand, and ſo for wilde <hi>Satyrs,</hi> luſts, ſenſual, and ſinful distempers on the other hand, to be ingendred and bred, as alſo to live and ſubſiſt, to move, and act, and take their paſtime in, the knowledg of the Truth being mortal unto both: I now add;</p>
            <p>Fifthly; That Error diſpoſeth the Soul to Apoſtaſie from the Goſpel, and to a recidivation or falling back into the devouring ſin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief. This it doth not only by giving opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and encouragement unto luſts, and inordinate affections in the Soul, the motions and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of which are to the life of Faith, that which poyſon is to the natural life of a man; but alſo by repreſenting the Gospel unto the mind and conſcience of a man, (at leaſt in ſome of the ways and paſſages of it) as weak, unworthy, dark, unpleaſant, uncouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or whatſoever, Error, when the Soul by long acquaintance and converſe with it ſhall diſcover the true nature or <hi>genius</hi> of it, and ſo grow into a diſlike and contempt of it, ſhall now appear unto them, For this is much to be conſidered, that a man, or woman, who have for many years profeſſed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, may in proceſs of time come to diſcover vanity in ſome erroneous Principle or Tenent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherewith their Judgments had been leavened for ſome conſiderable ſpace formerly, and ſo grow into a diſapprobation or contempt of it, and yet may very poſſibly think and ſuppoſe, that the Goſpel favours or countenanceth it, and that otherwiſe they ſhould never have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or approved it. Now when a perſon ſhall be brought into the ſnare of ſuch a conceit or imagination as this, that the Gospel in ſome of the veins or carriages of it teacheth or aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth things that are vain, or of no good conſiſtency with Reaſon or Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is in a ready po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to throw off from his Soul all credence of the Divine Authority of the Gospel, and to esteem it no better then a Fable deviſed by men, Nor will all that which he Iudgeth ſerious, and ſound, and good in the Doctrine of the Gospel otherwiſe, relieve him in ſuch a caſe. He that imagines that he ſmells but ſo much as one dead Fly in the oyntment of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

No mans heart or conſcience will ſerve him to reverence that, as coming from God, wherein he ſavours the leaſt weakneſs, error, or untruth.</p>
            <p>Sixthly: Though an Error ſeems to be meerly ſpeculative, and in respect of the frame and conſtitution of it, to have no affinity or intermedling at all with the moral principles, or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of men, as that of Ana-Baptiſm, (amongst ſome others;) ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Or if the difference be not to be made, by the interpoſure and exerciſe of Reaſon in a man, I demand, by what other principle, or means, ought it to be made?

            <p>1.

               </gap>he ſoundneſs, or unſoundneſs whereof he deſires to underſtand by it. For 1. It is not the letter, or form of words, as ſeparated, or conſidered apart, from the ſpirit, notion, or ſence of them, that is the Touchſtone, or Rule of Tryal for Doctrines. Yea the letter and words, are only ſervants to the ſence and notion which they contain and exhibit, and were principally, if not only, delivered by the Holy Ghost unto men, for this end, that by them the Sence, Mind, and Counſel of God in all the particularities of them which are held forth in the Scriptures, might be communicated and conveyed to the Reaſons and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of Men. So that in caſe a man had the ſence and mind of God upon the ſame terms of certainty and knowledg, without the letter, on which he hath it, or may have it, by means of the letter, he ſhould be as richly, as compleatly qualified hereby to diſcern between Doctrines, as he now can be by the opportunity and advantage of the letter. Now if the Scriptures themſelves be upon no other terms, nor in any other caſe, ſerviceable or uſe ful unto men for the tryal of Doctrines and Opinions, but only, as, and when, they are truly underſtood by them, it clearly follows, that whatſoever is requiſite and neceſſary to bring men to a true underſtanding of the Scriptures, is of equal neceſſity for the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Doctrines, and to interpoſe, or be made uſe of, in all affairs and concernments in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. If then the Reaſons, Judgments, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of men must of neceſſity inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, act, argue, debate, and conſider, before the true ſence and mind of God in any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be duly apprehended, underſtood, and beleeved by men, it is a plain caſe that theſe are to be uſed, and to be intereſſed in whatſoever is of any Religious conſequence or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us. That the Mind of God in the Scriptures cannot be duly apprehended, received, or beleeved by men, but by the acting and working of their Reaſons, Minds, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,

               </gap> evident from hence: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Mind of God cannot be thus apprehended, or beleeved, by men, but by means of an intellectual or rational differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tasted or reſented by them, between this mind of his, and all other minds, meanings, or ſences, whatſoever, that may be ſuppoſed to lie, or reſide, in the words. For example: if there be another ſence to be given of ſuch, or ſuch, a paſſage of Scripture, either contrary unto, or differing from, that, which I conceive to be the Mind of God here, which hath the ſame rational or intellectual ſavour and taſte with this, that is, which as well ſuits with the words, agrees with the Context, falls in with the ſcope and ſubject matter in hand, is as accordable with Scripture aſſertion elſewhere, comports as clearly with the unqueſtionable Principles of Reaſon, and the like, how is it poſſible for me in this caſe, to conceive or beleeve, especially with the certainty of Faith, that my ſence is the Mind of God, and conſequently the true ſence of that place, rather then that other, which hath all the ſame Characters, Symptomes, and Arguments of being the Mind of God, which mine hath? Therefore it muſt needs be by the exerciſe and acting of my Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and by the report which they make of their Diſcoveries in their Enquiries, that I come regularly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and to be ſatisfied, that this is the Mind of God in ſuch, or ſuch a Scripture, and none other.</p>
            <p>If it be here objected and demanded; But is it meet, or tolerable, that the Reaſon of man ſhould judg in the things of God? Or that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of men ſhould umpire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in his Affairs? I anſwer,</p>

            <p n="2">2.

It was this <hi>darkneſs,</hi> which they had through an oſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, looſe, and ſenſual converſe with their own Scriptures, voluntarily ſuffered to grow and ſpread it ſelf upon the face of their Minds and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, that was a ſnare upon them, and occaſioned the ſad Event here mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> that when the <hi>light ſhone unto them (i. e.</hi> when ſufficient and pregnant means were vouchſafed unto them, to have brought them to the acknowledgment of their <hi>Meſſiah) they comprehended it not, i. e.</hi> did not by the means of it come to ſee and underſtand that, for the ſight and knowledg whereof it was given them. For that (by the way) is to be obſerved, that the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> doth not ſay, that the <hi>darkneſs</hi> in which the <hi>light ſhined,</hi> could not, or, was not able, to <hi>comprehend it,</hi> but onely, that it did <hi>not comprehend it.</hi> Now it is a known Principle in Reaſon, that <hi>à nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione actus, ad negationem potentiae, non valet argumentum.</hi> There may be a defect in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or performance, where there is no defect of power for action. And the very obſervation and report which the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> maketh of the <hi>non-comprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>light</hi> by the <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in which it ſhone,</hi> plainly enough imports, that the defectiveneſs of this <hi>darkneſs</hi> in not <hi>comprehending the light,</hi> did not conſiſt in, or proceed from, any natural or invincible want of power to <hi>comprehend</hi> it, but from a blindneſs voluntarily contracted, and willingly, if not wilfully, perſiſted in. For how can it be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that this <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> who flyeth an higher pitch then his fellows, in drawing up his Evangelical tydings for the uſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the World, ſhould, in the very entrance of his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and whileſt he was thundering out on high (as one of the Fathers ſpeaks) the Divinity of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> inſert the relation of a thing, that had nothing ſtrange, nothing more then of common and ordinary obſervation in it? Or is it any thing more then ordinary, or what is moſt obvious, that men do not fly in the ayr like birds, or that fiſhes do not ſpeak on the Earth like men? Or is it a thing of any whit a more ſavory conſideration, then theſe, that men voyd of all capacity, deſtitute of all power, to comprehend the light, ſhould not comprehend it? But that there ſhould be a generation of men, whom it ſo infinitely concern'd to <hi>comprehend the light,</hi> to acknowledg and own their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> being now come unto them, and who withall had a rich ſufficiency of means to have done the one and the other, ſhould notwithſtanding be ſo ſtupid and unlike men, as not to
<pb facs="tcp:94900:11"/> 
               <hi>comprehend this light,</hi> not to acknowledg or own this their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> is a matter of high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and aſtoniſhment, and the mention of it very commodious and proper for that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of diſcourſe, which the Holy Ghoſt had now in hand (as might be ſhewed more at large, but that I fear the Reader hath already more then his burthen, of an Epiſtle.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Concerning that Scripture, <hi>(1 Cor. 2. 14.) But the natural man perceiveth not &amp;c.</hi> if, Reader, thou conceiveſt there is any thing in it ſpoken with any intent to diſable Reaſon or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in a man, ſo far, as to deveſt them of all capacity or power, for the apprehending, conceiving, or beleeving any the things of God, yea or particularly of ſuch of the things of God, the diſcerning and beleeving whereof is of abſolute neceſſity for Salvation, thou mayſt, if thou pleaſeſt, deliver thy Judgment from the miſtake, by the peruſal of a few Pages in a Diſcourſe formerly publiſhed <note n="l" place="margin">

               </note>, where thou wilt finde this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Scripture opened at large, and driven home to its iſſue. Here I clearly demonſtrate theſe three things: 1. That the place ſpeaketh not of the <hi>natural, i. e.</hi> of the unregenerate man, but of the weak <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the <hi>babe in Chriſt. 2.</hi> That the things of God here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, are not ſuch things, the knowledg or diſcerning whereof is of abſolute neceſſity to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but the high, or deep things of God; of the true and worthy diſcerning of which, onely the <hi>ſpiritual man, i. e.</hi> the ſtrong and well-grown <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, capable. 3. (And lastly) That the incapacity of theſe things of God, which is here aſſerted to be in the <hi>natural man,</hi> or weak <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is not an utter or abſolute incapacity, or ſuch which by a diligent uſe of means he may not very poſſibly, and according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Providence, out-grow; but onely a preſent or actual incapacity, or indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which is regularly, and (as it were) of courſe, curable. Theſe things I there evince from the expreſs tenor and carriage of the Context.</p>
            <p>4. (And lastly, to the Objection) Concerning Heathen Philoſophers, Heretiques, and others of great Parts, and natural endowments of Reaſon, Wit, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, &amp;c. who either rejected the Gospel as a fable, as the Philoſophers, or elſe perverted and wreſted the Truth thereof in many things, to their own deſtruction, and (poſſibly) to the deſtruction of others, as Heretiques; I anſwer; When I affirm and teach, that Reaſon, or the Intellectual part of a man, is competent to apprehend, diſcern, ſubſcribe unto, the things of God, and of the Gospel, my meaning is not to affirm withall, that therefore men of theſe Endowments, though never ſo excellently enriched with them, muſt of neceſſity apprehend, diſcern, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto theſe things. Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding even of the greateſt advance in men, will ſerve men for other ends and purpoſes, beſides the apprehenſion and diſcerning of the things of God in the Gospel, and may accordingly be improved and imployed by them. Yea they may be imployed againſt the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and made to war and fight againſt the Truth of it. It is a ſaying of known Truth concerning all things that have not an eſſential connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a mans ſoveraign good:</p>
            <q>Nil prodeſt, quod non laedere poſsit idem: i. e.</q>

            <p>Becauſe ſome men ſuffer themſelves to be bewitched with a corrupt deſire of <hi>drawing away Diſciples after them,</hi> and for the fulfilling of ſuch a luſt, <hi>ſpeak perverſe things</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Acts 20. 30</note> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,) it doth not follow from hence, that therefore they were in no capacity, or in no poſſibility, of ſpeaking the Truth, and refraining from the teaching of perverſe things. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaking of riches, ſaith, that <hi>it is unpoſsible that he ſhould have them, who takes no care to have them</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:94900:12"/> Concerning Heretiques, it is a common notion amongst us, that theſe from time to time were turned aſide from the way of Truth by ſome unclean Spirit, or other, as of Pride, Ambition, Envy, Voluptuouſneſs, or the like. If theſe Spirits once enter into a man, they will ſoon call in, and take unto themſelves, other Spirits worſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hen themſelves, I mean, Spirits of Error and Deluſion, to advocate for them, and plead their cauſe. As for the miſtakes and miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages in Judgment of good men, upright (in the main) with God and the Goſpel, about ſome particular Points, they are to be reſolved into ſeveral Cauſes, of which we ſhall not now ſpeak particularly. Only this I ſhall ſay; whatſoever any mans Error or miſtake in Judgment is about the things of the Gospel, it is not to be imputed to any deficiency on Gods part in the vouchſafement of means unto him competent and ſufficient, as well for the guiding into, as for the keeping of his Judgment in, the way of Truth: but into ſome deficien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, neglect, or incogitancy of his own, which he might very poſſibly have prevented, or overcome. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Concerning the Spirit of God, by which alone, and in oppoſition unto Reaſon, many affirm and teach, that the things of God, and matters of Religion are to be apprehended, diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and known, I anſwer; That ſuch an Opinion as this is a conceit as uncouth, as palpably weak, and ill-coherent with it ſelf, as lightly can be. For if only the Spirit of God within me apprehends the things of God, and I my ſelf apprehend them not, (and apprehend them I cannot, but by my Reaſon, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding, having no other faculty wherewith to apprehend, or conceive,) ſuch an apprehenſion of them relateth not at all unto me. Nor can I any whit more be ſaid to apprehend them, becauſe the Spirit of God apprehends them in me, then I may, or might, in caſe the ſame Spirit ſhould apprehend them in another man. That which another man meditates, or indites in my houſe, without imparting it unto me, no whit more concerns me, then in caſe he ſhould have meditated or indited the ſame things in the houſe of another man. Beſides, the Spirit of God being but one and the ſame infinite indiviſible Spirit in all men, he cannot with any tolerable propriety of ſpeech, nor with truth, be ſaid to apprehend, diſcern, or conceive that in one man, which he doth not after the ſame manner apprehend, diſcern, and conceive in another; yea, in every man. Therefore if there be any thing more apprehended, or diſcerned of the things of God, in one man, then in another, the difference ariſeth, not from the different apprehenſions of the Spirit in theſe men, but from the different apprehenſions of theſe men themſelves, and this by their own reaſons and underſtandings, they having (as hath been ſaid) no other faculties, principles, or abilities, wherewith to apprehend, but theſe.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded, But is any man able without the preſence and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, to diſcern the things of God, or to judg aright in matters of Religion? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Plainly and directly to the Heart (I ſuppoſe) of thoſe, who make this demand, No: The Spirit of God hath ſuch a great Intereſt in, and glorious Superintendency over, the Minds, and Spirits, Reaſons and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstandings of Men, that they cannot act, or move re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, or perform any of thoſe operations or functions, that are moſt natural and proper to them, upon any worthy or comely terms, especially in matters of a ſpiritual concernment, but by the gracious and loving interpoſure and help of this Spirit. For (queſtionleſs) the intellectual frame of the Heart and Soul of man, was, by the ſin and fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> wholly diſſolved, ſhattered, brought to an abſolute Chaos and Confuſion of Ignorance and Darkneſs, to a condition of as great an impotency to do him the leaſt ſervice in order to his comfort or peace in any kind, as can be imagined. So that if the Reaſons and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of men quit themſelves in their actings or workings, with honour, or in any due proportion to their benefit, comfort, or peace, it muſt needs be by means of that Gracious Conjunction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God with them; which is a vouchſafement unto the children of men, procured by him, who raiſed up the Tabernacle of <hi>Adam,</hi> when it was fallen, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> Bleſſed for ever; In respect of which vouchſafement purchaſed by him, and given unto men for his ſake, He is ſaid <hi>to enlighten every man coming into the world</hi>

So that what light ſoever, of Truth, what clear and ſound principle, or impreſſion of Reaſon, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding ſoever, is, ſince the Fall, to be found in any man, is an expreſs fruit of the Grace, that is given unto the World upon the account of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and is re-inveſted in the Soul by the appropriate interpoſure of the Spirit of God, the gift whereof upon this account, is ſo frequently and highly magnified in the Scriptures. Yea not only the habitual reſidency of all principles of Light and Truth in the Soul, is to be attributed unto the Spirit of God as ſupporting and preſerving them from
<pb facs="tcp:94900:12"/> defacement, but alſo all the actings and movings of the rational powers of the Soul according to the true exigency, ducture, and import of them, as in all right apprehenſions of things, in all legitimate and ſound reaſonings, and debates, whether for the confirmation of any Truth, or the confutation of any Error, or the like.

            <p n="2">2. Though the Spirit of God contributes by his aſſiſtane after that high manner which hath been declared, towards the right apprehending, underſtanding, diſcerning, the things of God by men, yet this no ways proveth, but that they are the Reaſons and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of men themſelves, that muſt apprehend, diſcern, and underſtand theſe things: and conſequently muſt be provoked, raiſed, ingaged, imployed, and improved by men, that they may thus appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and diſcern, notwithſtanding all that aſſiſtance which is adminiſtred by the Spirit: otherwiſe nothing will be apprehended, or diſcerned by them. Nor will the aſſiſtance of the Spirit we ſpeak of, turn to any account of benefit or comfort, but of loſs and condemnation unto men, in caſe their Reaſons and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings ſhall not advance, and quit themſelves according to their interest thereupon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In caſe the Spirit of God ſhall at any time reveal [I mean, offer and propoſe] any of the things of God, or any ſpiritual Truth, unto men, theſe muſt be apprehended, diſcerned, judged of, yea and concluded to be the things of God, by the Reaſons and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of men, before they can, or ought, to receive or believe them to be the things of God, yea before ſuch a Revelation can any ways accommodate, benefit, and bleſs their Soul. When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſpeaking of the Spirit to His Diſciples, ſaith, <hi>And he will ſhew you things to come:</hi> and again; <hi>He ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew them unto you, (Joh. 16. 13, 14.)</hi> He ſuppoſeth that they <hi>(viz.</hi> with their own Reaſons and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings) were to apprehend and judg of the things that ſhould be thus ſhewed unto them, to have been ſhewed unto them by the Spirit of God, and not to have proceeded from any other Author. Yea in caſe men ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things of God themſelves <hi>FOR</hi> the things of God, or of the Spirit of God, before their Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding have upon rational Grounds and Principles judged them to be the things of God, yet can they not receive them upon theſe terms, <hi>As</hi> the things of God; I mean, as the things of God ought in Duty, and by Command from Himſelf, to be received by Men; or ſo, as to benefit or inrich the Soul by their being received. For as God requires of men to be <hi>praiſed with Underſtanding</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſalm 47 7</note>, [<hi>i. e.</hi> out of a rational apprehenſion, and due conſideration of his infinite worth and Excellency,] ſo doth He require to be believed alſo.

               <note n="d" place="margin">Acts 17. 29</note>.</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And lastly) The Interpoſure and actings of Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in men, are of that ſoveraign and moſt tranſcendent uſe, yea neceſſity, in and about matters of Religion, that all the Agency of the Spirit notwithſtanding, a man can perform nothing, no manner of ſervice unto God with acceptation, nothing in a way of true Edification to himſelf, without their engagement and ſervice. Firſt, I ſtand charged by God, <hi>not to beleeve every ſpirit, but to try the ſpirits, whether they be of God</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 1</note>. I demand, by what Rule or Touchſtone ſhall I try any ſpirit? When, or upon what account, ſhall I reject one, as a ſpirit of Error, Falſhood and Deluſion? and do Homage with my Iudgment and Conſcience to another, as the Spirit of God? If it be ſaid, I ought to try the ſpirits by the Scriptures, or Word of God; I demand again, but how ſhall I try my Touchſtone, or be ſure that that principle, notion, or ground, which I call the Word of God, and by which I go about to try the ſpirits, is indeed the Word of God? There is ſcarce any ſpirit of Error that is abroad in the Chriſtian World, but freely offers it ſelf to be tryed by the Word of God, as well as the true Spirit of God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> by ſuch meanings, ſences, or concluſions, as it ſelf confidently aſſerts to be the Word of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Mind of God in the Scriptures. So that I am in no capacity to try ſuch a ſpirit, which upon ſuch an account as this pretends his coming forth from God, unleſs I be able to prove, that thoſe ſences, meanings, and concluſions, by which he offers to be tryed, are not indeed the Word of God. Now it is unpoſſible that I ſhould prove this meerly and only by the Scriptures themſelves: becauſe unto what place, or places ſoever, I ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for my proof or tryal in this caſe, this ſpirit will reject my ſence and interpretation, in caſe it maketh againſt him, and will ſubſtitute another that ſhall not oppoſe him. Nor can I
<pb facs="tcp:94900:13"/> reaſonably or regularly reject his ſence in this caſe, at leaſt as an untruth, unleſs I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſome reliſh or taste therein, which is irrational, or ſome notion, which jarreth with, or grateth upon, ſome clear principle or other of reaſon within me. For as on the one hand, what Doctrine or notion ſoever clearly accordeth, and is commenſurable, with any ſolid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted principle or ground of Reaſon within me, is hereby demonſtrably evinced to be a Truth, and from God: ſo on the other hand, what Doctrine or ſaying ſoever bears hard, or falls foul, upon any ſuch principle, muſt of neceſſity be an Error, and ſomewhat that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Satan, or from men, and not from God.

It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>alſo requiſite that this Doctrine</hi> (he ſpeaks of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, Election, and Reprobation) <hi>agree with the grounds of common Reaſon, and of that knowledg of God, which may be obtained by the light of nature.</hi> In this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his he clearly ſuppoſeth, that whatſoever ſhould be taught by any man in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and high points of Predeſtination, otherwiſe then according to the Scriptures, and the Truth, may be clearly diſproved by this, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſagreement of it with the grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reaſon, and of that knowledg of God which the light of Nature ſhineth into the hearts of men. If himſelf had kept cloſe to this principle of his own, in drawing up his Judgment in the point of Predeſtination, the World had received a far differing and better account from his pen of this ſubject, then now it hath. But if his ſence were, that the heights and depths of Religion (for ſo we may well call the Doctrines of Election and Reprobation, &amp;c) have nothing in them but what agreeth with the grounds and principles of common reaſon, and with the Dictates of Nature in men, and conſequently may be meaſured, diſcerned, and judged of by theſe, he did not conceive that matters of a more facile and ordinary conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were above the capacity and apprehenſion of Reaſon. It was the ſaying of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that <hi>God hath bowed down the Scriptures to the capacity even of Babes and Sucklings. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> hath much upon this account to excellent purpoſe. In one place (ſpeaking of the Soul being yet ſimple, rude, and unfurniſhed with any acquired knowledge, either from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or other inſtitution) he demands why <hi>it ſhould be ſtrange,</hi> that being <hi>given by God, it ſhould ſpeak out (or ſing) the ſame things, the knowledg whereof God giveth unto his children.</hi> Not long after he admoniſheth the Gentiles, that <hi>neither God, nor Nature, lye:</hi> and thereupon, that <hi>they may beleeve both God and nature, willeth them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve their own Souls.</hi> A little after he ſaith, that the <hi>Soul</hi> he ſpeaks of, <hi>hath the words</hi> (and therefore the inwards ſenſes and impreſſions) of <hi>Chriſtians, whom notwithſtanding it wiſheth that it might never hear, or ſee.</hi> Elſewhere, having mentioned ſome expreſſions of affinity with the Scriptures, as oft coming out of the mouths of Heathen, he triumphs (as it were) over them with this acclamation. <hi>O, the Teſtimony of a Soul naturally Chriſtian!</hi> Nor doth <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf ſay any whit leſs then all this, when <hi>he</hi> ſaith, <hi>that God hath implanted</hi> [or inwardly put] <hi>the ſeed of Religion in the mind of men.</hi> Doubtleſs the ſeed ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth richly with that body, which springs and grows from it. But theſe things by the way. All impreſsions, all principles of light and truth, which are found written in the hearts and conſciences of men, are here written by the finger of God himſelf. Therefore what spirit or Doctrine ſoever ſymbolizeth in notion, and import, with theſe or any of them, muſt of neceſſity be of the ſame parentage and deſcent with them, there being no original Parent or Father of light and truth, but God only. And on the contrary, what Doctrine or ſpirit ſoever, putteth any of theſe Principles to ſorrow, or ſhame, and doth not lovingly comport with them, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declare themſelves to be of a spurious and ignoble race, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> reaſoned with the <hi>Iews: If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth, and came from God</hi>

            <p>Concerning the myſtery of the Trinity, the Incarnation of God, or, the Son of God, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a Virgin, with ſome other points of like conſideration, commonly pretended to be againſt, or at leaſt, above, and out of the reach and apprehenſion of Reaſon, I clearly anſwer: 1. That they are every whit as much, yea, upon the ſame terms, out of the reach of Faith, as
<pb facs="tcp:94900:13"/> of Reaſon. For how can I beleeve (at leaſt upon good grounds, and as it becometh a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> to beleeve, whatſoever he beleeveth) that which I have no Reaſon, nor am capable of apprehending any Reaſon, nay, for which there is no Reaſon, why I ſhould beleeve it? If it be ſaid, I am bound to beleeve the Doctrines ſpecified, becauſe they are revealed by God; I anſwer, that this is a rational ground, whereof my Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding are throughly capable, why I ſhould beleeve them. The light of Nature clearly informeth me, that what God revealeth, or ſpeaketh, muſt needs be true, and conſequently, worthy and meet to be beleeved. If it be further ſaid; but Reaſon is not able to apprehend, or conceive, how three ſhould be really and eſſentially one, and the ſame: how a Virgin ſhould conceive, and bring forth a Son, &amp;c. I anſwer, that no Faith or Belief in ſuch things as theſe, is required of me, nor would be accepted with God, in caſe it were in me, above what I am able by my Reaſon to apprehend, and underſtand. As I am not able to apprehend by my Reaſon, the particular and diſtinct manner how the three Perſons ſubſiſt in one and the ſame Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Eſſence, ſo neither am I bound to beleeve it. That which I am bound to beleeve in this Point, is onely this, that there are three who do thus ſubſiſt (I mean, in the ſame Divine Eſſence) and for this, my Reaſon is apprehenſive enough why I ſhould beleeve it, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe God himſelf hath revealed it (as hath been ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) If I ſhould confidently beleeve any thing more, or further, concerning the Trinity of Perſons (commonly ſo called, and there is the ſame Reaſon of the other Points mentioned) then what I know upon the clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding, it would be preſumption in me, and not Faith; and I ſhould contract the guilt of thoſe, whom the Apoſtle chargeth with <hi>intruding [or, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing] themſelves into the things, which they have not ſeen</hi>

            <p>2. If it be yet demanded, but is it not contrary to the grounds of Nature, and ſo to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reaſon, that a Virgin ſhould conceive a Child? And if ſo, how can ſuch a Doctrine, according to what you have aſſerted, be received as from God, or, as a Truth? I anſwer; it is no ways contrary to Reaſon, nor to any Principle thereof that God ſhould be able to make a Virgin to conceive, but very conſonant hereunto; as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſed it credible enough (as we lately heard) even in the eye of Reaſon, that God ſhould make the Earth bring forth her dead, alive <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 26, 8</note>. Indeed that a Virgin ſhould conceive in a natural way, or according to the courſe of ordinary Providence, is contrary unto Reaſon: but this Religion requireth not of any man to beleeve. Nor doth it bear hard at all upon any Principle of Reaſon, that God ſhould be willing to do every whit as great and ſtrange a thing as that (I mean, as to cauſe a Virgin to conceive) for the accompliſhment of ſo great and glorious a deſign, as the ſaving of a loſt World. Nor is it contrary to Reaſon, or any Principle thereof, that God, or the firſt Being, being infinite, ſhould have a manner of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, or Being, far different from the manner of ſubſistence, which is appropriate to all created and finite Beings; or that this manner of ſubſisting, which is proper unto him, ſhould be unto men incomprehenſible. But most conſonant it is to Principles of Reaſon, when God himſelf hath pleaſed ſo far to reveal that appropriate and incomprehenſible manner of his ſubſisting, as to declare and ſay, that he ſubſisteth in three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that men ſhould accordingly beleeve it ſo to be. So that moſt certain it is that there is nothing in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, which, ſo far as it concerneth men to know and beleeve, but what fairly and friendly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports with that Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding which God hath given unto Man, and what by a diligent and conſcientious uſe of theſe noble faculties, he may come to know and believe, at leaſt ſo far as to ſalve his great Interest of Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Look with how many Precepts, Exhortations, Admonitions, I ſtand charged by God to ſubmit unto, and practiſe, I am under ſo many charges and engagements from him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to exerciſe my Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding. 1.

The truth is, I ſtand bound in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and conſcience towards God, and in faithfulneſs to mine own Soul, neither to beleeve any thing at all, as coming from God, which I have not, or may have, a very ſubſtantial ground in Reaſon to beleeve cometh indeed from him: nor yet to do any thing at all, as commanded by him, unleſs there be a like ground in reaſon to perſwade me that it is indeed his command.</p>

This alſo is evident from the carriage of the ſame Parable: where the ſervants, who had received the Talents, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them faithfully (by whom are typified our Saviours, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>thoſe that have,</hi> as was lately ſaid) are graciouſly invited by their Maſter into his <hi>joy: Enter thou into thy Maſters joy:</hi> So to the other; <hi>Enter thou into thy Maſters joy.</hi> Now if either God, or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be ſignified and meant by the Maſter of theſe ſervants (as I ſuppoſe no man queſtions, but that either the one, or the other, are typified hereby) by, <hi>entering into their joy,</hi> cannot be meant a receiving of a greater meaſure of natural gifts or endowments, nor of receiving any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which belongs to perſons qualified only with ſuch Endowments as theſe, but, Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Eternal Bleſſedneſs and Glory. If ſo, it roundly follows, that by what <hi>Chriſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth ſhall be <hi>given</hi> to him <hi>that hath</hi> (in the ſence declared) is meant ſomewhat of a ſaving conſequence, as regenerating Grace, the ſanctifying Spirit of God, Faith, and the like. And promiſing, not only, or ſimply, that <hi>to him that hath, ſhall be given,</hi> but further, that <hi>he ſhall have abundantly,</hi> he clearly ſignifieth, that in caſe men will provoke, ſtir up, and lay out themſelves accordingly in the improvement of ſuch abilities and gifts, which ſhall from time to time be vouchſafed unto them, they may, by vertue of the bounty and gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God in that behalf, attain and receive from God what proportion or meaſure of the Spirit of Grace, and of God, they can deſire. Therefore they that teach men to be meerly paſſive in matters of Religion, and forbid them the uſe of their Reaſons and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, as unlawful, or dangerous, in theſe affairs, how prudently ſoever they may conſult their own carnal eaſe, honor, or worldly accommodations by ſuch a Doctrine, yet herein they ſay unto men (in effect) Be not excellent: let it never be ſaid, that the God of <hi>Heaven</hi> hath made you rich, or Great.</p>
            <p>Good Reader, I have no Apology for my Prolixity in the Argument in hand, but only the high and ſoveraign importance of it, together with mine own abounding in the ſenſe of that moſt ſad Calamity, under which the world groaneth by means of the importune &amp; tyrannical Regency of that Notion or Doctrine, unto the depoſal whereof I have lift up my Heart and Hand in all that I have ſaid herein. I ſhall only add this one word more (upon this account) at the preſent: Whereas thou (I fear) art ready to complain of a long <hi>Harveſt</hi> already, the truth is, that all I have ſaid in the buſineſs hitherto, is but a <hi>firſt-fruit</hi> of that abundance, which yet remaineth in my ſpirit and Soul, ready to utter it ſelf upon any other like occaſion, for the eradication and utter extirpation (if it be poſſible) of that moſt peſtilential and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious notion and conceit out of the minds of men. In the mean time I ſhall make thee ſome part of amends for thy patient bearing of my burthen in this Point, by as much brevity as thou canst reaſonably deſire in the third and laſt particular yet remaining. The tenour hereof was, to remove ſome ſtumbling ſtones, which it is like have been thrown in thy way, to alienate thy mind from the peruſal of the Diſcourſe enſuing.<note place="margin">Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of, the preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, with others of like Argument, anſwered.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For Satan and men have together deviſed and hammered out variety of Arguments, or Pretences, to alienate the minds of weak and inconſiderate perſons, not only from the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines themſelves here aſſerted, but even from acquainting themſelves with Books or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, of like Argument and Plea with the Diſcourſe before thee.</p>
            <p>One Vizor very hideous and affrighting, which they put upon the face of ſuch Diſcourſes as this, to ſcare children in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding from them, is, that they teach the uncomfortable, ſad, and diſmal Doctrine of the poſſibility of Saints and true Beleevers falling away, and this both totally and finally. But how far this Doctrine is from being either uncomfortable, ſad, or diſmal, I ſhall not here ſtand to demonſtrate: but refer thee to the nineth Chapter of the Diſcourſe it ſelf (with ſeveral other paſſages afterwards) where I evidently prove, the two oppoſite Doctrines being duly and unpartially compared together, that that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth this poſſibility, is every whit as great, yea a far greater Enemy to the peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Saints, then that which affirmeth it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Some labor to work a distaste of ſuch Diſcourſes as we ſpeak of in the minds of men, by poſſeſſing them with a conceit, that they are derogatory and injurious to the Grace, or freeneſs of the Grace, of God, in the Salvation of Men: and that they exalt Nature, and the abilities hereof, as Free-will, and the like, to the diſhonor and prejudice of this Grace. To this I anſwer, 1. That I am no ways responſible for all that may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb facs="tcp:94900:15"/> ſibly be taught or ſaid, in every Treatiſe, or Diſcourſe, that buildeth up one or more of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines here aſſerted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only for ſuch things, wherein their ſence and mine greet e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch other. 2. I anſwer to the Charge (in reference to my ſelf, and my Doctrine and Judgment touching the Grace of God) that it is of a like conſideration and relation between my Accuſers, and me, as the accuſation of an unchaſte deportment brought against <hi>Joſeph</hi> by his Mistreſs was between them. For as the Accuſer here, and not the Accuſed, was guilty of the crime ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the Accuſation: ſo the truth is, that the Sence and Opinion of thoſe, who ſentence my Doctrine as injurious to the Grace, or freeneſs of the Grace, of God, are themſelves deep in the condemnation, my Doctrine being as innocent, as the manifeſt Truth it ſelf is, from ſuch a crime: Nor doth it exalt Nature any whit more, if not much leſs, then they. For, 1. Concerning the Grace of God, and the freeneſs hereof, I hold and teach nothing but what fairly and fully accords with theſe Poſitions. 1. That the Original or firſt-spring of the Salvation of the World, and ſo of every particular perſon, that comes to be ſaved, was in, and from, the Grace, the free Grace and good Pleaſure of God. 2. That the whole method, or ſyſteme of Counſels, by which, and according unto which, God effecteth and bringeth to paſs the Salvation of all that are ſaved, did proceed wholly and entirely from the ſame Grace and good pleaſure. 3. (And more particularly) That the gift of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for a Mediator and Saviour unto the World, and ſo the Grant or Promiſe of Justification, and Salvation unto men, by, or upon beleeving, iſſued ſolely and wholly from the ſame Grace. 4. That men by Nature, and of themſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> conſidered in, and under ſuch a condition, as they were brought unto by <hi>Adam,</hi> and wherein they ſhould have ſubſisted (in caſe they had ever been born, and lived in the world) had not the free Grace of God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to relieve them, and better their condition, have no ſtrength or power, not the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or propenſion of Will, to do any thing, little or much, acceptable unto God, or of a ſaving import. 5. That notwithſtanding this reſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ration or healing of the natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man by the free Grace of God, yet there is not one of a thouſand, poſſibly not one throughout the whole World, but ſo far corrupts himſelf with the luſts of the fleſh, and ways of the World, that without a ſecond relief from the free Grace of God, as <hi>viz.</hi> in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and long-ſuffering towards him, ever comes to repent, or believe, or to perſevere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, and ſo to be ſaved. 6. That it is from the free and undeſerved Grace of God, that any perſon of Mankind is ſo much as put into a capacity of beleeving, or hath power and means vouchſafed unto him, ſufficient to enable him to beleeve. 7. That a man is put into this capacity of beleeving by an irreſiſtible acting or working of the free Grace of God. 8. That when any man, by vertue of the power and means vouchſafed unto him by the free Grace of God, comes actually to beleeve, the exerciſe and acting of this power proceeds alſo from the free Grace and good pleaſure of God: ſo that no man ever believeth, without a preſent and actual aſſiſtance from the free Grace of God in order to this his beleeving, over and above his ability or power to beleeve. 9. (And laſtly) That the act of beleeving, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is performed by any man, is ſo inconſiderably, and at ſo low a rate of efficiency from a mans ſelf, that (to help apprehenſion a lttle in the caſe) ſuppoſe the act of believing could be divided into a thouſand parts, or degrees, nine hundred ninety and nine of them are to be aſcribed unto the free Grace of God, and onely the one remaining, unto man. Yea this one degree of the action is no otherwiſe neither to be aſcribed unto man, then as graciouſly ſupported, ſtrengthened, and aſſisted by the free Grace of God. The <hi>Reader</hi> will finde none of theſe Poſitions contradicted by any thing affirmed or denyed in the Diſcourſe. I attribute as much as poſſibly can be attributed to the free Grace of God, in, and about the Act of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ſalving the attributableneſs of the Action unto man himſelf, in the loweſt and moſt diminutive ſence, that can well be conceived. For certain it is, that it is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Man, not God, or the Spirit of God, that believeth: and therefore of neceſſity there muſt ſo much, or ſuch a degree, of Efficiency about it be left unto man, which may with truth give it the denomination of being his. And they that go about to intereſs the free Grace of God, in, or about the act of Believing, upon any other terms, or ſo, that the act it ſelf cannot truly be called the Act of the Creature, or of Man, are injurious in the higheſt maner to the Grace of God at this main turn, rendering it altogether unprofitable to the poor Creature, who by the verdict of ſuch a Notion, ſhould be left in his ſins, and never come to be juſtified. For the Law of Justification is expreſly this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>He that believeth, ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> Therefore if it be not man himſelf, who believeth, it is unpoſſible that he ſhould be juſtified. He that ſhall ingenuouſly and unpartially compare the Doctrine of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb facs="tcp:94900:15"/> touching the Grace of God, with that, the ſubſtance whereof hath been expreſſed in the nine Poſitions lately exhibited, will clearly find, that this Grace is by many degrees more highly, and with another manner of an Heavenly Magnificence, advanced by the tenor and import of this Doctrine, then of the other; yea and that Nature is far more depreſſed and abaſed, in the latter, then in the former. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some pretend, that the Doctrines and Opinions maintained in ſuch Diſcourſes as this, are only old rotten Errors, rejected and thrown out of the Church by Orthodox men in all Ages: But they who hedg up the way of men with ſuch thorns as theſe, to keep them from reading ſuch Books as we ſpeak of, cannot but ſcratch, yea rend and tear, their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with them. Concerning the two Doctrines more largely handled in the following Diſcourſe, I prove upon a moſt pregnant account in the fifteenth Chapter for the one, and in the nineteenth for the other (beſides many other places in the body of the Diſcourſe) that they were never rejected or caſt out of the Church by any Council, or Synod, reputed Orthodox (at leaſt until the late Synod of <hi>Dort)</hi> but were conſtantly taught by all Orthodox Antiquity, are at this day more generally taught by the Lutheran Party of the Reformed Churches, yea and have many full and clear Teſtimonies of their Truth from the Pen of <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, and many others that are counted Pillars on his ſide.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some are brought out of Love with ſuch Diſcourſes as this, by being informed, that they are full of nice, ſubtil, and curious ſpeculations: and that the ſecrets of God are too narrowly and preſumptuouſly pried into by the Authors of them, To this I anſwer, 1. If any man, whether in the handling of the Doctrines we now ſpeak of, or of any other, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth himſelf into the things which he hath not ſeen, or above the proportion of his Faith, let him ſuffer as a Tranſgreſſor of the Law of Sobriety: I ſhall not be his Advocate. For the Diſcuſſions managed in the Treatiſe enſuing, I go no further, then I feel the ground firm under me. Or if at any time I come to a place that is ſoft and tender, I tread light, and charge no great matter of weight upon it. Yet, 2. Not to go up to the Mount, when God calleth, and offereth the kiſſes of his mouth unto us there, under a pretence of danger in climbing, is to reject the bounty of Heaven, and to betray our richeſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the making of our ſelves Excellent, and Great in the ſight of God, and Angels, and Men. 3. Things revealed in the Scriptures, as well thoſe of the moſt ſpiritual and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime conſideration (which our Saviour calls, <hi>Heavenly</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">John 3. 12</note>, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſometimes, <hi>the deep things of God</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10</note>, ſometimes <hi>ſtrong meat</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 5. 14</note>,) as well as things of a more obvious and facile import, <hi>belong unto us and our children,</hi> i. e. are our ſpiritual Patrimony, which God our Father hath given us to maintain our ſelves honorably, as <hi>viz.</hi> in Faith and Holineſs, in the World. Every inch of ſuch an Inheritance is worth the ſtanding upon, and contending for. <hi>4. Ariſtotle</hi> in his Moral Diſcourſes ſomewhere obſerves, that perſons who are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious or tardy in either of the extreams, frequently cenſure him that is truly vertuous, and ſteers a middle courſe between them, as if he were an Offender in that extream, which is oppoſite to the other extream, wherein themſelves are Delinquent. So it is to be feared, that many who complain of curioſity in ſpeculation, and of prying into the ſecrets of God, are themſelves dull of hearing, of remiſs and un-engaged ſpirits in the things of God: and therefore call the moſt ſubstantial and ſolid Diſcourſes, if they be of any conſiderable eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and worthy thoſe, who are ſpiritual, and men in Underſtanding, by the unworthy name of nice and curious ſpeculations. 5. (And laſtly, for this) I confeſs that the Doctrine of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Reprobation, and ſo of the extent of the efficacy of the Death of Chriſt, and of the Interest of the Spirit of God in the Work of Converſion, might have been managed and carried with far leſs appearance of curioſity, had not the Controverters of the one ſide for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the ſolid Grounds and Principles of Reaſon in their Expoſitions of the Scriptures, and obtruded upon the World ſuch notions and conceits under a pretence of Scripture Authority, becauſe of an appearance of ſome words and phraſes comporting with them; the vanity and unſoundneſs whereof could not be ſufficiently detected, but by the light of ſome ſuch ſtrains of Reaſon, which the minds and thoughts of men being not accuſtomed unto, may at firſt very probably cenſure as more curious then ſafe, more ſubtle then ſound. But the ſaying of <hi>Baſil</hi> is worthy conſideration at this Point: <hi>Truth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is hard to be taken by hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and muſt be found out by a narrow obſerving of her footſteps on every ſide</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. And more eſpecially, the diſcovery of the Truth in the Controverſies we ſpeak of, mainly depending upon the knowledg of the Nature of God, and of the manner of his Actings, which are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a very ſpiritual and obſtruſe contemplation, it cannot reaſonably be expected, but that
<pb facs="tcp:94900:16"/> the Diſputes themſelves ſhould ſometimes ſoar high, ſo that the ordinary apprehenſions of men may poſſibly loſe the ſight of them for a time.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some plead a non-neceſſity of beſtowing our time in looking into Books that ſhall now, or hereafter, be written, about the Argument or Subject matter of the preſent Diſcourſe, upon a pretence, that nothing more can be ſaid therein, then hath been ſaid already<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that all Scriptures, and Arguments that can be levyed for the defence of the Doctrines maintained herein, have been already anſwered. Such a pretence as this is proper for men, who hope to make a great purchaſe with a little money; to produce the honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of much knowledg and learning, by uttering a few aſſuming and daring words. For upon what ſober and rational account can ſuch a ſaying proceed from any man? Or who can ſay unto the Almighty, with due reverence to the unſearchable Riches, either of his Wiſdom, or of his Grace and Bounty; Hitherto indeed thou haſt advanced thy ſelf in giving Wiſdom and Underſtanding unto men, but further thou canſt not go, thy treaſures are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt? It becometh not me to ſay, unleſs I were inveſted with <hi>Paul</hi>'s priviledg, of <hi>ſpeaking</hi> without offence <hi>like a fool</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 16 23</note>, that there are ſeveral Conſiderations and Grounds traverſed in the preſent Diſcourſe, and theſe intimouſly relating to the Controverſies there handled, which I beleeve the Maſters of the pretence laſt ſpecified, have not obſerved in all their Travels through thoſe many regions of Books and Authors, which they would be ſuppoſed to have read and ſtudied for the Information of themſelves and others with the Truth in thoſe great Controverſies. And whereas the Pretext in hand glorieth, that all that hath been ſaid in defence of the Opinions avouched in our Diſcourſe, hath been already anſwered, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he takes Sanctuary at ſome very unproper ſignification of the word, <hi>Anſwer,</hi> his glorying in this behalf will be found to his ſhame: yea ſuch a Sanctuary as this will not much relieve him. Indeed as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith of the ancient <hi>Britans</hi> of this Nation in relation to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> eos potius triumphatos, quam victos fuiſſe, that the <hi>Romans</hi> rather <hi>triumphed</hi> over them, then <hi>overcame</hi> them; ſo have the Adverſaries of the Opinions and Doctrines we ſpeak of, been at the charge of erecting many Trophies one after another, as if they had by the Sword of the Spirit, and dint of Argument, vanquiſhed and ſubdued them, and trodden down their ſtrength; whereas upon a true and unpartial account, the main Grounds and Pillars, upon which the ſaid Doctrines ſtand, will be found to remain undemoliſhed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken to this day; yea and to have too much evidence and clearneſs of truth in them ever to be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>Some pretend, that the Opinions contended for in this Diſcourſe, have been from time to time taken up and held (for the moſt part) by a looſer and leſs-Religious generation of men; and the contrary, by perſons of a better Name for Holineſs, and Worthineſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. This notion is acceſſory to ſome mens ſtumblings at the ſaid Opinions, yea and at all thoſe, whether men, or Books, that give the right hand of fellowſhip unto them. But what near communion this notion hath with darkneſs and untruth, is abundantly proved, in the nineth, fifteenth, and nineteenth Chapters of the Diſcourſe, (beſides other places.) Although the truth is, that, were there truth in it, yet would there be little weight in it to mediate a reſolved Enmity between mens Iudgments, and theſe Opinions. The Devil held, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was <hi>the Holy One of God</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Mark 1. 24</note>, and profeſſed it, whileſt <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuted him, and <hi>thought verily</hi> that he was bound to <hi>do many things againſt his Name</hi>

            <p>The noiſe of <hi>Arminianiſm, Pelagianiſm, Socinianiſm,</hi> is very terrible in the ears of ſome, and make the ſaid Opinion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the dread and abhorring of their Souls; and all Books, and men, that own them, as the ſhadow of death unto them. To this I anſwer, 1. That it is a ſaying of <hi>Luther,</hi> that <hi>God ſometimes puts on the vizor of the Devil, and the Devil, the vizor of God. But God would be known</hi> [by men] under the vizor of the Devil, and would have the Devil rejected under the vizor of God <note n="h" place="margin">

Odious names, and imputations, are but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils vizors; which, though they be by men put upon the face of Truth, will not excuſe us in our rejections of the Truth. But, 2. Concerning the Charge of <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> I demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in ſeveral paſſages in the Diſcourſe, that the Opinions there pleaded, have an expreſs diametral antipathy againſt the Errors of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and that the ſence of our Adverſaries, in oppoſition to us, is truly <hi>Pelagian. 3.</hi> Concerning <hi>Arminianiſm;</hi> I confeſs I do not well underſtand what men mean by it. I ſuppoſe they mean, the owning of ſuch Doctrines or Opinions, in oppoſition to the Truth, (ſo voted, and called, by men) which were held and taught by <hi>Arminius.</hi> If ſo, the formality or eſſence of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> doth not ſtand, in
<pb facs="tcp:94900:16"/> holding any thing ſimply in oppoſition to the Truth, but in oppoſition unto men, as ſuppoſed by themſelves and others to be Truth.

If the opinions commended by me for Truth in the work in band, be <hi>Arminian,</hi> certain I am that the ancient Fathers and Writers of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church were generally <hi>Arminian:</hi> yea and that <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, had many ſore fits and pangs of <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> (at times) upon him; yea and that the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> it ſelf was not free from the infection; nor ſcarce any writer of name and note in theſe latter times.

            <p>Some pretend, that all diſputes in matters of Religion, wherein the received Doctrines, or Tenents generally held in thoſe places where ſuch diſputes are commenced, are oppoſed, tend to the unſetling and diſquieting the minds and conſciences of men: and miniſter occaſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many to abandon all care and thoughts of Religion, as containing little in it but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of uncertainty, and doubtfulneſs of disputation: and upon this account, very paſſable (as they ſuppoſe) are profeſſed enemies to ſuch Disputes. But to this we briefly anſwer, 1. That it is much better that mens judgments and conſciences ſhould be for a time disturbed, then that they ſhould always remain <hi>ſetled</hi> upon the lees and dregs of any rotten and unſound opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. We lately ſhewed how perilous Error is to the precious Souls of men. God never dealt more graciouſly by the <hi>Earth,</hi> then when he <hi>ſhook the Heavens,</hi> by ſending the Meſſiah of the World to turn the ſtate of Religion (as it were) upſide down in the midſt of it. <hi>David</hi> acknowledged unto God, that it was good for <hi>him that he had been afflicted; that ſo he might learn his ſtatutes</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 71</note>. And ſo many (I beleeve) have (and happy were it, had more the like) cauſe to ſay it; It is good for us that we were ſometimes ſhaken in our judgments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that we might learn the Truth. 2. They who are offended, that there ſhould be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings and disputes to and fro about the things of God, and matters of Religion, ſeem to be, either diſcontented that the things and counſels of God ſhould be ſo ſpirituall, or remote from the common, or firſt apprehenſions of men, that all men ſhould not at once underſtand them; or elſe loath, that they who are in the gall of any bitterneſs, by being intangled with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſhould be delivered. We read that <hi>Paul</hi> frequented the <hi>Synagogue for the</hi> ſpace of <hi>three months</hi> together, <hi>diſputing and perſwading the things concerning the Kingdom of God</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 19 8</note>. And afterwards, that for <hi>two years together he diſputed dayly</hi> [about matters of the ſame nature and import] <hi>in the houſe of one</hi> Tyrannus <note n="c" place="margin">Ver. 9. 10</note>. 3. (and laſtly) Had it not been for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes in matters of Religion, the pillars of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> Throne had not been ſhaken to this day. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon occaſion of thoſe frequent diſputes in <hi>Germany</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ather much against it, yet let me ſay; 1. That however ſin and an evil converſation, are juſt matter of ſhame and diſparagement unto a man, yet Repentance and amendment of life, are truly honourable. Nor do I know why it ſhould be of any more diſparaging an interpretation againſt any man, to reform his Judgment, then his life, neither of which can be done without a change in either. Nor 2. can I reſent any ſuch conformity with my never-ſufficiently-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, adored Saviour, which conſists in an <hi>increaſe of wiſdom</hi> (for herein he is reported to have <hi>increaſed,</hi> in the days of his fleſh <note n="g" place="margin">Luke 2. 52</note>) any matter of prejudice, or diſparagement, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to my ſelf, or any other man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Though he indeed was never prevented with error, yet was He poſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enriched with the Truth in many things. A man can hardly (if poſſibly) <hi>grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 18</note>, without out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> growing himſelf in judgment and understanding from time to time, without rectifying and making streight many things in his mind and thoughts, which were crooked before. 3. That choſen veſſel <hi>Paul,</hi> never quitted himſelf like a man, never conſulted peace and glory to himſelf, untill he built up that Faith, which ſometimes he had deſtroyed. Nor was his Authority or eſteem in the Gospel, and in the things of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ever a whit the lighter upon the ballance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſometimes been a <hi>Phariſee. 4.</hi> I deſire to ask the men, that make the change of my judgment a ſpot of weakneſs, or vileneſs in it, whether themſelves were always in the ſame mind touching all things, with themſelves at preſent. If ſo, it plainly argues, that their thoughts and apprehenſions, now they are men, are but ſuch, which are incident unto chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And if, ſince their coming to riper yeers, they have always ſtood, and are reſolved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſtand, by their firſt thoughts and apprehenſions in all things, it is a ſign that their judgments reſide more in their wills, then their wills in their judgments: and that they are much more like to judg according to appearance, then to judg righteous judgment. But this whole Nation knoweth (to its ſorrow, and ſad ſufferings) that many of the Perſons we ſpeak of, have ſhifted their judgments (and that in matters of a far more ready and eaſy Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, then the queſtions about Predeſtination) into a troubleſome corner. Yea, there are very few of thoſe amongſt them, who call themſelves Miniſters of the Goſpel, but many times, when they preach, within the compaſs of an hour, either change their judgments, or deny them, their Doctrine being frequently <hi>Samaritan,</hi> when their application is a <hi>Jew. 5.</hi> If to dig <hi>broken Ciſterns,</hi> with the <hi>forſaking of the Fountain of living Water, be the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a double evill</hi>

And if ſo, ſhall it not be of ſo much the higher acceptation with God? And if it be thus, ought it not to be of higher acceptation with men alſo? To forſake an error, is one duty; and to embrace truth, is another: whereas to perſiſt in one and the ſame mind, ſuppoſe it be ſound and good, is but a ſingle duty. Our Saviour informeth us, that <hi>there will be joy in Heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, more then over ninety and nine juſt perſons, that need no repentance</hi>

            <p>The Holy Ghoſt indeed judged the Aſſertion of this Truth, and that by one<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> of his Greateſt Inſtruments, worthy of him; yet not ſo much, I ſuppoſe, to commend it ſimply as a Truth, or to ſecure the judgements and conſciences of men of the Veracity of it, as to inforce the practicall conſequences thereof upon them; upon which ground (doubtleſſe) it is, that we finde ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary Truths, not only delivered, but ſome of them oft repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inculcated, in the Scriptures.

That Chriſt feels no weight, or burden, of the Univerſe, whilſt he ſupporteth it. The ſpeaking of <hi>a word,</hi> eſpecially within himſelfe, and in his mind only, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth no mans ſtrength, nor putteth him to the leaſt pain. This great Act of <hi>bearing up</hi> the Univerſe, is therefore, (I conceive) appropriated unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (though common to the other perſons with him) becauſe in his Mediatory Humiliation he laid a foundation of Equity and Reaſon, why God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that great provocation given by the ſin of man, to diſſolve it, ſhould yet conſent to the ſtanding and ſupportation of it. Such executions which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his Mediation, and for which there had been no place otherwiſe, are elſewhere in Scripture peculiarly aſſerted to him in reſpect thereof: See <hi>John</hi> 5. 27. Though in reſpect of the Divine Nature, Power, and Will, being one and the ſame in all the three Perſons, there is a neceſſity of their joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in all actings <hi>ad extra,</hi> (as the Schoolmen call them,) yet ſuch of theſe actings, for which way hath been made by any perſonall atchievement or tranſaction of any of the Three, may, with a good ſavour of Reaſon, be in a more ſpeciall and remarkable manner attributed to that perſon, who hath more peculiarly interpoſed for the procurement of them.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle affirmeth, that <hi>we live and move in God</hi> (in the ſence<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> declared) as well as <hi>have</hi> our eſſence, or <hi>being,</hi> in him, his meaning ſeems to be, that it is through God, and his voluntary cloſing with us, that we have, and do enjoy, all manner of accommodations of Being, as well the greater and leſſer, as Eſſence or Being it <hi>ſelf.</hi> To <hi>live,</hi> oft-times in Scripture, ſignifies the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an happy and contentfull condition, which ſignification is no ways inconvenient for this place. Or if the Apoſtle be conceived to ſpeak of the <hi>life naturall,</hi> (which is not improbable) he muſt be ſuppoſed to include all thoſe noble and deſireable faculties and endowments, as of Reaſon, Memory, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Underſtanding, Speech, &amp;c. which are appropriate to the <hi>life</hi> of man: So that when he ſaith, <hi>We live in God,</hi> his meaning is, not only, or ſimply, that that ſpring or fountain of vitall actions or motions in men, which in a diſtrict ſence is termed <hi>life,</hi> is poſſeſs'd, enjoyed, and held by means of a gracious and loving comportment of God with them for ſuch a purpoſe; but that all that honourable retinue likewiſe of thoſe excellent powers and faculties named, which attend upon the Principle of <hi>life</hi> in man, is maintained in being by the ſame compliance alſo.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94900:21"/>
            <p>Whereas he adds, That in him alſo, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>we move,</hi> or are moved (as the<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> word rather importeth) he implyeth, not only that all our vitall actions and motions are exerciſed and performed by the gracious concurrence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance of God with us, as well as our lives themſelves, and Principles of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſerved; but further, that there is a further and appropriate concurrence of God required (and by him accordingly exhibited) to enable men to act thoſe very Principles of action and motion that are in them, diſtinct from that by which their lives, and Principles of action, in every kind, are preſerved: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that though men be never ſo well appointed or provided for action in one kind or other, in reſpect of ſuitable, proper, and ſufficiently-diſpoſed Principles thereunto, yet upon a ſuſpenſion of that particular influence or concurrence by God, which is appropriate and neceſſary, both for the leading forth unto, and for the ſupporting of theſe Principles, in, and under, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per actions, there is none of them will go forth into action, nor is able to maintain or ſupport it ſelfe in acting. But whether ſuch a concurrence of God ſuppoſed, and actually granted, as is ſufficient both for the leading forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and for the ſupport of the Principles we ſpeak of, in their proper actings, theſe Principles notwithſtanding (at leaſt ſuch of them, whoſe actions lie under the command of the will) may not refuſe or forbear to act, is another Queſtion, wherein more may be ſaid hereafter.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, that God may at any time ſeparate between Principles,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> and their actings, even thoſe that are moſt proper and connaturall to them, only by with-holding that compliance of his with them, which is appropriate and neceſſary for their conducting unto action, is evident from ſeverall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Scriptures. Doubtleſſe, the heat of the fire in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> furnace, being het ſeven times hotter then ordinary, was as proper, as likely, a means, to have conſumed <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> being caſt into the midſt of this furnace, as thoſe, who were imployed by the King only to caſt them into it. Nor can it reaſonably be ſaid, That God ſeparated the heat, or burning property, from the fire, or annihilated it, all the time that theſe three men were in the furnace. For, 1. unleſſe we ſhall ſuppoſe the ſubject it ſelf, I mean, the fire, to have been deſtroyed, or annihilated, we cannot ſuppoſe, that heat, or a burning property, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> property inſeparable from ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſhould be taken from it. 2. It appears by the ſtory, that thoſe, who caſt the three Servants of God mentioned into the furnace, were conſumed by the fire of it, whilſt the Servants of God remained in the furnace. Therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there was true fire, and true heat in the furnace, whileſt the three men continued in it. 3. And laſtly, The ſtory ſaith, That the <hi>Princes, Governors, and Captains, &amp;c. being gathered together, ſaw theſe men upon whoſe bodies the fire had no power</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 3. 27.</note>. So that there is not the leaſt queſtion, but that there was reall fire, and reall heat, and that in abundance, in the furnace; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>had no power,</hi> no not ſo much as over <hi>the hair of their heads,</hi> or the garments they wore. What now was the Reaſon why this fire, and this heat, prevailed not over thoſe that were caſt into the midſt of them, as they did over thoſe, who caſt them in? Was it any other then this? The Lord of hoaſts his withdrawing the wonted conjunction of himſelfe from the heat of the fire, and refuſing to comply with it in that expedition, or attempt, which it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to make upon theſe men, as well as upon any others, to deſtroy them; whereas he kept his naturall and accuſtomed union with this heat, in that attempt which it made upon thoſe other men, who caſt theſe into the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; by means whereof it ſuddenly prevail'd upon them; and conſumed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94900:21"/> them. There was the ſame Reaſon, why the <hi>Buſh,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw <hi>burning with fire,</hi> was <hi>not conſumed</hi> by it. The Reaſon likewiſe (in all likelihood) why the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> could not find the door of <hi>Lots</hi> houſe, was, becauſe God withdrew his uſuall concurrence from their viſive faculty in order to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of that object: For that other things were all this while viſible enough to them, appears from their continued endevours, even unto wearineſs, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this door. If they had bin wholy blind, ſo that they could have ſeen nothing, at all, it is no ways credible but that they would have deſiſted their enterprize at the very firſt. This withdrawing or ſuſpenſion of the wonted Preſence of God with the Seeing faculty of men, is called, <hi>the holding of their eyes:</hi> Luk.<note place="margin">Luke 24 16.</note> 24. 16. <hi>But their eyes were holden, that they could not know him:</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Whenſoever ſecond Cauſes move into action, whether they act congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to their reſpective natures and kinds, or whether defectively, they ſtill have, and muſt have, a preſence of the firſt Cauſe with them, (as hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready argued.)

            <p n="2">2. When they faile or faulter in their motions or actings, if their motions be ſuch which are not morall, or commanded by the will, (of which kind the mis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> repreſentation of the perſon of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the eyes, or viſive faculty, of the two Apoſtles, was) I conceive that the preſence or concourſe of the firſt cauſe with them, is attempered and proportioned in order to the deficiency of the action; I mean, as well to the degree, as kind, of this deficiency, and is not the ſame with it ſelfe in the ordinary and proper actings of theſe faculties: The reaſon hereof, is, becauſe faculties meerly naturall, act determinately and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly, after one and the ſame manner, unleſſe they be troubled, and put out of their way by a ſuperior power.

Now then if this faculty, when it moves or acts inordinately, ſhould be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the firſt Cauſe, as hereby to be determined, or neceſſitated to the inordinacy of its actings: 1. That diſtinguiſhing property we ſpeak of, ſhould be diſſolved or deſtroyed, and the will it ſelfe hereby reduced to the Order, and Laws, of Cauſes meerly naturall. 2. The inordinateneſſe or ſinfulneſſe of the motions and actings of it, could not be reſolved into it ſelfe, or its own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but into that over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ruling and neceſſitating influence of the firſt Cauſe upon it, which it was not able to withſtand, nor to act beſides, or contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the determinating exigency thereof.

The Apoſtles aſſertion, That <hi>we move in God,</hi> in the ſence aſſerted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is viſibly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with theſe two conſequentiall Truths: 1. That God doth aſſociate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and communicate with Second Cauſes, and all created Principles, in their reſpective motions and operations; and conſequently, contributes more towards their motions and operations, then only by a collation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, of a ſufficient ſtrength, or virtue, in their reſpective cauſes to produce them. 2. That the ordinary effects, acts, and operations produced in theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary parts, are not ſo, or upon any ſuch terms attributable unto God, but that they have their Second Cauſes alſo reſpectively producing them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they may as truly, (and perhaps more properly) be aſcribed, as unto God.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Though there be as abſolute and eſſential a Dependance of Second Cauſes upon the firſt, in point of motion, action, and operation, as of ſimple Exiſtence, or Being: yet are not the motions, actions or operations of Second Cauſes (at leaſt, ordinarily) ſo immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or preciſely determined, by that Dependance, which they have upon the firſt Cauſe, as their respective Beings are.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe ſimple Exiſtences, or Beings, of things, may be ſaid to be determined<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> by God, the firſt Cauſe, three ways: 1. In reſpect of their Natures, or conſtituting Principles of their reſpective Beings. 2. In reſpect of their production into Being. 3. And laſtly, In reſpect of their permanency or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, in, and with, theſe Natures, and Beings. In the firſt conſideration, they are abſolutely, and in every reſpect, determined by God; neither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor any other, contributing any thing at all towards their Natures, or Beings (in that ſence,) nor being in any capacity, to withſtand, or make any reſiſtance againſt, that hand of Pleaſure, and Power, which made them ſo, or ſo, and imparted ſuch and ſuch a nature, or frame, determinately unto them. But ſecondly, In reſpect of their reſpective actuall productions into Being, they are not (at leaſt a great part of them are not) ſo determined by God, as in the former conſideration. Men may ſow more or leſs grain or corn in their fields as they pleaſe: and ſo likewiſe herbs in their gardens. Yea, the ordinary courſe and aſſiſtance of Providence only ſuppoſed, they have power to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply individuals in ſome ſpecies of animal creatures; and however, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain ſuch a multiplication. Yea doubtleſs many Perſons, both of men and women, have been propagated and born into the World, whoſe Parents were not determined, or neceſſitated, to their generation. In the third and laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, though things cannot (at leaſt, all things cannot) be ſaid to be abſolutely, poſitively, or irreſiſtibly determined by God, as in the firſt, yet doth his will and pleaſure, for the moſt part, interpoſe effectually, though by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94900:23"/> the mediation of Cauſes, either naturall, or morall, or both, for a determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this kinde alſo. The continuance of Herbs, Plants, and Trees, in their vegetative lives, or Beings, in reſpect of their ſpecies, or kindes, reſpectively, is determined by God, but by the intervention of their ſeverall natures, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures, conſtitutions, or the like. So that thoſe Herbs, Plants, or Trees, more generally, and in reſpect of their kindes, are longer liv'd, whoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and complexions are more healthfull and ſtrong, and ſo better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to reſiſt, and defend themſelves againſt ſuch inconveniences, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger, and are deſtructive unto, the lives and beings of ſuch creatures, as they. The continuance of individuals, or particulars in each kinde of theſe vegetative creatures, in their reſpective Natures or Beings, is not ſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by God, but that they are obnoxious (at leaſt many of them) to the hand, and will of man, who may at pleaſure ſerve himſelfe of which, and of how many, of them he pleaſeth, being within the reach of his arme, and under his power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A man may cut down, and ſuffer ſtill to grow, which, and how many of the Trees growing in his own ground, he pleaſeth. Thus may he do alſo by the Herbs in his garden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is the ſame conſideration in all reſpects of ſenſitive creatures alſo. The lives of many of theſe are ſubjected to the wills and pleaſures of men.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Naturall Lives and Beings of men in the World, neither<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> is the continuance of theſe ſo abſolutely, or peremptorily fixed, or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, but that either themſelves, or others, may either abbreviate and contract them, or elſe enlarge and protract them to a longer period, by means proportionable unto either. By exceſs in ſinning (and ſo by defect in cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and uſe of means for their preſervation) men may draw the evill day of death neerer to them; as by righteouſneſs, and a prudent circumſpection to prevent dangers, and things deſtructive unto life, they may put it further from them. <hi>But thou, O God</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) ſhalt bring them downe into the pit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: bloody and deceitfull men ſhall not live out halfe their days</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſa. 55. 23.</note>; <hi>e. i.</hi> the half of thoſe days, which according to the courſe of Nature, and Providence, and Will of God otherwiſe, they might have done. To like purpoſe <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> ſpeaking of a wicked man <hi>who stretcheth out his hand againſt God, and ſtrengtheneth himſelfe againct the Almighty; i. e.</hi> who ſinneth at more then an ordinary rate of provocation; <hi>His branch,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall not be green, but ſhall be cut of before his day. God ſhall destroy him, as the vine his ſowre grape, and ſhall caſt him off, as the Olive doth his flower</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Job 15. 32, 33.</note>. And againe afterwards: <hi>Haſt thou marked the old way, which wicked men have troden? who were cut down out of time, whoſe foundation was overflown with a flood</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Job 22. 15, 16</note>. It is probable he here ſpeaks of the old World, who becauſe of that redundancy of wickedneſs which was amongſt them, were deſtroyed by a deluge of waters, which otherwiſe they might have eſcaped: according to what our Saviour ſpeaketh to <hi>Capernaum</hi> concerning <hi>Sodom; If the mighty workes which have been done in thee, had beene done in Sodom, it would have remained unto this day</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 11. 23.</note>. And whereas God threateneth <hi>Ephraim</hi> (meaning, the ten Tribes) that <hi>within threeſcore and five years Ephraim ſhould be broken, that he be not a People</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Iſai. 7. 8.</note>, this judgement, according to <hi>Muſculus</hi> his computation, was put in execution within twenty years after this Prophecy, and that <hi>propter enormitatem maliciae,</hi> as he faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the enormous heinouſneſſe of their wickedneſſe. So then, as God hath by no decree determined that men ſhall be wicked, eſpecially not outragiouſly wicked, (which we ſhall further demonſtrate afterwards) ſo neither hath he determined that abbreviation of the lives of particular men, which their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94900:23"/> exceſſe in wickedneſſe brings upon them. He hath indeed determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indefinitely, and in the generall, That <hi>bloody and deceitfull men ſhall not live out halfe their days:</hi> but if we ſpeake of any particular perſons, who being <hi>bloody and deceitfull,</hi> came thereby to an untimely end, neither their ſin, nor their ſuffering by an untimely end, was determined by God.</p>
            <p>Againe, That men by a prudentiall, and providentiall care in preventing<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> dangers, ſickneſſes, and ſuch inconveniences, which are of a known maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the life of man, may advance their days to a greater number, then under a contrary neglect, eſpecially as the neglect for degree might have been, they would, or could in reaſon have amounted unto, is evident. God himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>David,</hi> That if he ſtay'd in <hi>Keilah</hi> till <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould come thither to demand him, (which he was now ready to do) the <hi>Lords</hi> of this <hi>City</hi> would <hi>deliver him up</hi> unto him <note n="a" place="margin">Sam. 23. 12.</note>; in which caſe, he had been but a dead man. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> by departing from <hi>Keilah,</hi> before <hi>Sauls</hi> comming downe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, added many days unto his life, above what their number would have been, had he neglected the Divine Oracle, and by ſtaying in <hi>Keilah</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the hand of <hi>Saul.</hi> The men that were with <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſhip, by heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto his counſell for cauſing the Mariners <hi>to abide in the Ship,</hi> got en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of quarter for their lives, which upon their leaving of the ſhip had certainly been denyed unto them: For <hi>Paul ſaid unto the Centurion, and the Souldiers, Except theſe abide in the ſhip, yee cannot be ſaved</hi>

The Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, by the care and faithfulnefs of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in conveying him, being yet an Infant, into <hi>Egypt</hi> (according to the charge of the Angel which appeared unto him) came to ſee many more days in the fleſh, then he was like to have done, in caſe he had bin found in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> or near to it, when <hi>Herods</hi> bloudy Inquiſition came forth againſt him.

            <p>True it is, the days of humane ſubſiſtence and continuance on Earth, are<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> in the generall, but finite, yea, and few: yet if we ſpeake of particulars, they are not properly, determinate, or ſet down as ſo many, and no more, by any decree of God. <hi>It is,</hi> indeed, <hi>appointed</hi> [by God] <hi>unto men, once to dye</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 9 27.</note>: yea, as <hi>Job</hi> calculateth, within a ſhort time; <hi>Man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that is born of a woman, is of few days</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Iob 14. 1.</note>. But I do not find it ſaid of particular perſons, that it is appointed unto them to dye preciſely at ſuch or ſuch a time, day, or year, of their lives; or that they ſhall neither dye ſooner, nor live longer. I deny not, but that there are ſome few examples in Scripture, of perſons, the preciſe number of whoſe days ſeemeth to have been fixed by God. His graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meſſage to King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> being now ſick unto death, was, That <hi>he would adde unto his days fifteen yeares</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">King. 20. 6.</note>: Yet this expreſſion doth not neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that they ſhould be adequately and preciſely ſo many, and no more. Nor when <hi>Job</hi> in paſſion reaſoneth thus with God, (as our laſt Tranſlation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94900:24"/> his words) <hi>Seeing his days are determined, and the number of his moneths are with thee; thou haſt appointed his bounds, that he cannot paſse; turne from him, that he may reſt</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Job 14, 6, 7.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth he ſuppoſe, that the bounds and limits of all mens lives are ſo rigidly or immoveably pitched by any decree of God, that they muſt of neceſſity live home to them, and cannot poſſibly live beyond them; but only this, that if God will at any time interpoſe by his power to cut off the life of any man, he may <hi>determine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and put a period to it without being reſiſted, or hindred, by any. According to the exigency of this ſence, both <hi>Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> tranſlate that clauſe, <hi>and the number of his moneths are with thee,</hi> out of the Originall, thus; <hi>Numerus menſium ejus pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Doubtleſſe if either <hi>David</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> had conceived the date and period of their lives to have been irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly concluded by any precedaneous decree of God, they would not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded with that affectionate importunity, which is found in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for a prorogation of them. <hi>I ſaid,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, O my God, take me not away in the midſt of my days</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 102. 4</note>. And again; <hi>O ſpare mee, that I may recover my ſtrength, before I go hence, and be no more</hi>

                  </gap>:</note>. Theſe expreſſions clearly imply, That <hi>David</hi> apprehended as well a liberty in God, as an executive power, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſently to take away, or elſe to continue his life and being in the world, for a longer time. For who will ſollicite a man to do that for him, which he apprehends him in no capacity or poſſibility to do? or for that, which hee conceives him, whom he requeſteth, abſolutely engaged and neceſſitated to do for him, whether he requeſteth it, or no? Now ſuch a liberty in God as we ſpeak of, and as <hi>David</hi> ſuppoſeth, was wholy inconſiſtent, with ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory and irreverſible decree concerning the punctuall extent and durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his life, which ſome imagine. So when he <hi>faſted and wept</hi> for the life of his child, being ſick, he neither ſuppoſed God bound by any unchangeable decree, either to continue, or preſently to take away the life of it, but at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do either. In the Prayer of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though there be no expreſſe Petition found for the enlargement of his life, yet there are grounds laid down which are proper to inforce ſuch a Petition upon; and by the tender whereof unto God, it is evident, that he did ſollicite for a reprieve; which is yet more apparant, from that gracious return which God made unto him of this his Prayer, by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Go</hi> (ſaith God unto him) <hi>and ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hezekiah, Thus ſaith the Lord God of David thy Father, I have heard thy Prayer, and ſeen thy Tears; behold I will adde unto thy days fifteen years</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Iſai, 38. 5.</note>. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (doubtleſſe) when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, (as we heard) That <hi>the days of man are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,</hi> (or, <hi>paeciſi, i. e.</hi> cut ſhort, as <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> render it,) and that <hi>God hath appointed his bounds that he cannot paſſe,</hi> he doth not ſpeake of any <hi>determinate</hi> number of days or years, ſet out by any decree of his, unto particular Perſons for life, which by no interveniency of means, or occaſions, on either hand, can either be diminiſhed, or protracted; but of that generall councell, purpoſe, or decree of his, by which he hath reduced, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the mortall Pilgrimage of man on Earth, to a very ſhort and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſpace of time.</p>
            <p>Nor doth it follow from any the Premiſſes, but that God doth frequently<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> interpoſe, and that after a very ſpeciall and remarkable manner, ſometimes for the preſervation, other-while for the abbreviation and cutting off the lives of Particular men. When God will undertake, and reſolvedly engage to ſtand by the life of man, (as now and then he doth, at leaſt for a time,) <hi>a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94900:24"/> thouſand ſhall fall at his ſide, and ten thouſand at his right hand,</hi> and the danger <hi>not come nigh him, i. e.</hi> he ſhall remain as ſafe, and as free from evill, as if all danger of evill were far from him. <hi>He ſhall not be afraid [i. e.</hi> ſuch a man need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to be afraid] <hi>for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day: Nor for the peſtilence that walketh in darkneſſe; nor for the deſtruction that waſteth at non-day</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſa. 91. 5, 6, 7</note>. But dayly experience ſheweth, That God doth not engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon ſuch terms as theſe, for the protection of the lives of all that are godly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many of theſe falling by the hand of death, even whilſt the lives of <hi>thouſands,</hi> and <hi>ten thouſands</hi> round <hi>about them,</hi> are not touched there with. Nor have any Perſons, though never ſo godly, any ſufficient ground from the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages mentioned, or the like, to expect abſolutely, and with confidence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of life, in the midſt of all ſuch dangers, which are there ſpecified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> if God will vouchſafe to undertake for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Peace. Such Scriptures hold forth the conſtant power, not the uniform Will, or Pleaſure, of God. On the other hand, when God <hi>taketh no pleaſure</hi> (as the Scripture phraſe is) in the life of a man, the little finger of death is enough to cruſh it; my meaning is, a very ſlender and inconſiderable occaſion will ſerve his Providence for the diſſolution of it. But neither of theſe diſpenſations amounts to any demonſtration of any ſuch decree in God, wherein he hath punctually and indiſpenſably aſſigned to all Perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a ſet number of years, moneths, days, houres, and moments, for their allowance of life, which neither himſelfe, nor themſelves, nor any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath the leaſt liberty or power, either to augment, or diminiſh, upon any occaſion, or by any means whatſoever. It is indeed commonly reported to be a great Article in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Creed, That the lives of all men, at leaſt of all <hi>Turkes,</hi> are ſo abſolutely diſpoſed of in the counſell and decree of God, that it is a thing ſimply impoſſible for men, either by running upon the mouths of Cannons, or by caſting themſelves into the Sea, or by ruſhing naked into the midſt of an Hoſt of armed enemies, or by adventuring upon any danger, upon any death whatſoever, to anticipate the date of ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall; and ſo on the contrary, by any Care, Prudence, or circumſpectneſſe whatſoever, to prevent the fatality thereof. But ſuch Notions and Decrees as theſe, are fitter to make <hi>Alcoran</hi> Divinity, then <hi>Christian.</hi> I freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all the Decrees of God to be abſolute, and unchangeable, upon any occaſion, or by any means, whatſoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and none of them, in a true and proper ſence, conditionall: but I am far from making the Decrees of God commenſureable with his Preſcience, or fore-knowledge. But of this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>In order to a full and thorough explication of the ſubject laſt in hand, if<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> this had been any materiall part of our preſent deſigne, many Particularities, beſides thoſe inſiſted upon, ſhould have been added. But the conſideration of the dependance of the motions and actings of the creature upon God, in reſpect of their determination, is more intimous to the heart and ſpirit of our Grand Intendment, then of their ſimple exiſtences, or beings. Therefore (to paſſe on to the explication of this) we have laid downe for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Chapter, this concluſion, (either in words, or ſubſtance,) that the motions, actions, or operations of ſecond Cauſes, though they do as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely depend upon the firſt, as their exiſtences, or beings, (as was argued in the former Chapter) yet are they not by this dependance, at leaſt, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, ſo immediately, or preciſely, determined, as their beings. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding how their beings, in reſpect of their natures, their Productions,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94900:25"/> their ſubſiſtings, or durations in being, are determined, or not determined, by God, hath been the inquiry, and deciſion of the preceding part of this Chapter. We come now to inquire, how, how far, and after what manner, the motions and actions of ſecond Cauſes, are determined, or neceſſitated, to be both when, and where, and what they are, by that eſſentiall dependance, which they have upon God.</p>
            <p>All ſecond Cauſes whatſoever, are reducible to one of theſe three heads,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> or kind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Of the firſt ſort, are 1. all inanimate and life-leſſe creatures, as Fire, Water, Ayre, Earth, Stones, Minerals, and ſuch like. 2. all Creatures, which are endued with a Principle of vegetation, but not of ſence. Of the ſecond, are all animall, or ſenſitive Creatures, not partakers of any Principle or indowment, above thoſe of outward ſenſation, and a certaine eſtimative faculty, or phantaſie, by which they 1. apprehend what is naturally good, or evill, for them, (at leaſt in ſome Particulars) and 2. are acted and moved accordingly; as either to, or from, them, but without any deliberation, or conſideration had, either about the one, or the other. Of this kinde, are beaſts of the Field, birds of the Ayre, fiſhes of the Sea, and generally what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath breath and life, excepting men. Theſe are ſaid to act, or move <hi>Spontaneouſly,</hi> becauſe they act out of ſome knowledge of their end, without any compulſion or neceſſitation from without. Of the third and laſt ſort, are only men, and Angels, whether good, or bad, in either kinde; who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called rationall, voluntary, or free working cauſes, becauſe they are capable, not only of an apprehenſion or knowledge of ſuch ends, for, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining of which they act and move, but alſo of the nature, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and import of them, and of deliberation likewiſe, or conſulation, about the means and wayes of their Procurement.</p>
            <p>Now though all theſe ſeverall cauſes, have ſuch a dependance upon God,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> that (as hath been ſaid) none of them can move into action without a ſurable concurrence from him, yet are not their actions or motions thereby determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (ordinarily) or neceſſitated unto, or upon, them. The reaſon why fire burns, or heats, and doth not moiſten, coole, or the like, is not becauſe God concurreth with it, when it acteth: for then Ayre or Water, ſhould burn and heate likewiſe, with a like concurrence. Therefore the particular and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate actions of the Fire, are not cauſed by, doe not flow from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of God with it, when it acteth, but from that intrinſecall form, or thoſe naturall Properties, which he hath veſted in it by the Law of Creation.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94900:25"/> There is the ſame reaſon of other cauſes of this kinde in their reſpective acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or effects. Nor are the motions or actings of the ſecond kinde of cauſes mentioned, as of Birds, Beaſts, &amp;c. any whit more determined, then of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by the Preſence of God with them in their actions; but partly by their naturall abilities for action, or motion, partly by the naturall proportions, and diſproportions, between their reſpective Eſtimatives, or Phantaſies, and ſuch and ſuch Creatures, or Objects, whoſe natures are either proportioned, or diſproportioned, unto them. As for example, the reaſon why a lamb run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the dam, and fleeth from the Wolfe, is, partly the naturall ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy between the phantaſie of the lamb, and the dam, and the antipathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſaid phantaſie, and the Wolfe; partly alſo that ability or nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of motion, which God hath given unto this creature, for the conveyance of it ſelfe this way, or that, according as the phantaſie of it is affected. The concurrence of God with it when it runneth to the dam, and when it fleeth from the Wolfe, is (doubtleſſe) one and the ſame. So that the difference of theſe two motions in this Creature, doth not ariſe from any diverſity therein, but from one of the cauſes now mentioned.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the actions and motions of the third and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> tranſlated <hi>Power,</hi> doth not only ſignifie a <hi>Power</hi> of right, but of liberty alſo, or a freedome of will to diſpoſe of it, as he pleaſed: otherwiſe, a <hi>Power</hi> of right had been of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation unto him, nor any competent matter of the aggravation of his ſin. <hi>Why haſt thou put this thing into thy heart?</hi> viz. to diſſemble and lye, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and profeſſing to bring the whole money which thou receivedſt for the poſſeſſion, when as thou bringeſt a part of it only? God concurred with the motion of <hi>Ananias</hi> will, when he reſolved to bring his money to the Apoſtles for publique diſtribution; and ſo likewiſe, when he brought it: otherwiſe he could not have reſolved, or willed to do it. Yet this concurrence of God with him in his act of willing, or reſolving, did not make it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for him ſo to will, or reſolve, becauſe he had a <hi>Power,</hi> this notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to have willed or reſolved the contrary; I meane, either the keeping of the Poſſeſſion to himſelf, being yet unſold; or the not-bringing the money received for it, to the Apoſtles. Otherwiſe both the act of ſelling it, and alſo of bringing the money to the Apoſtles, muſt be looked upon, not as the acts of <hi>Ananias,</hi> but of God himſelfe. For whatſoever a man is neceſſitated to do, eſpecially by a Principle of force, or power out of himſelfe, is the act of the neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ator, not his. Yea the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> counteth it no flattery either of himſelfe, or any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> other man, to acquit both himſelf and them, of all ſuch irregular acts, whereunto they are neceſſitated, though by an inward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Principle. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if I doe that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but ſinne that dwelleth in me</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 7. 20.</note>. It is true, the act of <hi>Ananias</hi> his will, both for the ſelling of his Poſſeſſion, and bringing the money to the Apoſtles,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94900:26"/> in the very inſtant of the Elicitation or Production of it, was neceſſary in this reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe now it could not be unproduced, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon maxime; <hi>every thing that is, when it is, muſt of neceſsity be</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Unumquod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que quod eſt, quando eſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe eſt eſse.</note>: but it was not the concurrency of God with his Will, that impoſed any neceſſity upon him to produce it, becauſe then it had not been <hi>in his</hi> own <hi>power;</hi> neither had it been properly his own act, when produced.</p>
            <p>But it may be here objected, and ſaid; that though the ſpecificall actions,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> or motions, of all the cauſes mentioned, be determined (as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) by the ſpecificall natures, or properties of every of them reſpectively, and not by any concurrence of God with them, yet their individuall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular actions, and motions, are determined by ſome kinde of concurrence, or Providentiall interpoſall of God. As for example, that Fire (in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) burneth that which is combuſtible being put to it, is from the nature of it, not from any concurrence of God with it: but that it burneth ſuch, or ſuch a mans houſe, goods, or the like, this is not ſimply from the nature of it, without ſome ſpeciall diſpoſall of Divine Providence. So againe that wicked and ungodly men, ſhould (in the generall) do wickedly, as (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) plot, contrive, accompliſh the death of ſuch as are godly, proceedeth from themſelves, and from the corruption of their wills, not from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of God with them, nor from any ſpeciall interpoſall of his, in ſuch actings. But that ſuch and ſuch wicked men, by name, ſhould plot, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the deaths of ſuch and ſuch godly men by name, and not the death of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, godly alſo; proceedeth not ſo much from the wickedneſſe of ſuch men, as from ſome ſpeciall decree of God, together with a ſuteable interpoſall of his Providence and Power, for the effecting of it. That which <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Jewes</hi> did, in, and about the crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the hand and counſell of God had determined before to be done</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28. §. 11.</note>. To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this particular and ſignall attribution of ſome ſpeciall actions or events, unto God, or to <hi>the determination of his hand and counſell</hi> (other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whereof are to be ſeene, 1 <hi>King. 12. 15. 2 Sam. 17. 14.

            <p n="3">3. Some Interpreters (as <hi>Chryſoſtome, Oecumenius, Proſper,</hi> and others) do not refer the Decree ſpoken of <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 28. to the ſin of thoſe, who crucified <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but to the effects and fruits of his ſuffering, in this kind. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this interpretation, the ſence of the place will riſe thus: <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles, &amp;c. met together to do whatſoever the hand and counſell of God had determined before to be done. i. e.</hi> Whereas God had before <hi>determined</hi> to redeem and ſave the World by <hi>the delivering up of his Son unto death. i. e.</hi> By leaving of him to the wills and pleaſures, and in the hands of ſuch men, whom he infallibly fore-knew would put him to death, <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate, &amp;c.</hi> did now accordingly riſe up, and though knowing nothing of the <hi>determinate counſell of God</hi> concerning that which ſhould follow upon their wicked act, yet did that in crucifying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which effected it. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, to ſpeak properly, the redemption and ſalvation of the world, were not the effects of their act in crucifying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but partly of the <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate counſell of God</hi> in leaving him in their hands for ſuch a ſpeciall Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; partly of the obedientiall humility, and voluntary ſubjection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf to his Fathers Will and Pleaſure in that kind. So that that which <hi>the hand and counſell of God determined,</hi> was not the act of <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate, &amp;c.</hi> in putting him to death; but his own Providential act, or Premiſſion, in leaving him in their hands for ſuch a Purpoſe. God need not <hi>determine</hi> that <hi>before to be done,</hi> which he knew would be done without any <hi>determination</hi> of his in that behalf. See<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) for the true and genuine ſence and Purport of the Paſſage in hand, it is to be conſidered, 1. What the maine intent and ſcope of it is. 2. How the Words and Phraſes in the Paſſage may, and muſt be underſtood, in order hereunto.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, evident it is that the young converts <hi>or Chriſtians,</hi> who are ſaid to have uttered theſe words <hi>with one accord,</hi> intended hereby the magnifying of God (together with the ſtrengthening of their own Faith) for his moſt gracious and wonderfull diſpenſation, in, and about the death and ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> that in order to the Redemption and Salvation of the World, he ſhould ſo far diſpence with the Counſels and Methods of his ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in Protecting the innocent, and righteous, as to expoſe or leave <hi>his

               </gap> all others, to the rage, malice, and cruelty of wicked men, yea ſo far, as to ſuffer death it ſelf from them. There is no conſideration able to reconcile the Providence, or Permiſsion of God in leaving a Perſon of ſuch infinite Worth, Holineſſe and Greatneſſe, as the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> was, in the hands of wicked men, with Principles of Reaſon, Equity, or Prudence (and ſo to render it worthy Faith) but only ſome great and ſignall deſigne to be accompliſhed and effected by it. Hence it is, that in their mention of what <hi>Herod and Pilato, the Gentiles</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> had done unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Crucifying of him, they caſt and fix their eye upon the <hi>hand and determinate counſell</hi> of God; <hi>i. e.</hi> Upon the ſpeciall Counſell and Decree of God not to interpoſe by any Power or Providence of his, to prevent or divert the malice and rage, either of theſe, or of any other wicked men, that ſhould have attempted the ſame thing, from crucifying <hi>the Lord of life,</hi> (though ſo innocent and holy a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as he was) Here is not the leaſt intimation of any <hi>counſell</hi> or <hi>determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by God, that any of the Perſons here mentioned, or any others, ſhould have acted in, towards, or about the death of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but only that thoſe things <hi>ſhould be done (i. e.</hi> be permitted, or ſuffered by God to be <hi>done,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew further preſently) which theſe men <hi>met together</hi> to effect and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate. Nor was it any wayes neceſſary, that God, in order to the ſalvation of the World by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould <hi>determine</hi> or decree, that ſuch and ſuch men by Name, ſhould crucifie, or put him to death; no nor yet that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be actually crucified by any man, or men whatſoever: for the effecting of this great and bleſſed deſigne, it was ſufficient for God to <hi>determine</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that in caſe any man, or number of men, ſhould attempt his death, he would not reſtrain or hinder them from effecting it.</p>
            <p>If it be objected; But did not the Redemption and Salvation of the World depend upon the actuall death, or crucifying of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> and if ſo, ſhould not God have left this great and gracious deſigne of his in ſuſpence, and at uncertainty, for matter of execution, in caſe hee had not Abſolutely and Poſitively decreed the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by one meanes or other, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by thoſe who now did effect it, or by ſome other men? To this I Anſwer;</p>
            <p>No: the Salvation of the World (doubtleſſe) did not depend upon the actuall or literall dying, or crucifying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but partly upon the councell and good pleaſure of God, to <hi>deliver him up</hi> unto death in order to this end. [<hi>i. e.</hi> To leave him freely unto men to crucifie him, if they would] partly upon the readineſſe and perfect ſubmiſsion of will in Chriſt to ſuffer death, in caſe any man, or men, ſhould be found, that would inflict it upon him. My grounds and reaſons for this Opinion are;</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Salvation of the World depends wholly and intirely upon the merit and ſatisfaction of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in conjunction with the Will and good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God the Father to accept of this ſatisfaction in order thereunto, then did it, doth it, no wayes depend upon any thing done by other men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially wicked men, leaſt of all upon any thing done wickedly and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly in the ſight of God by them; and conſequently the actuall or literall Crucifiers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> contributed nothing at all ſimply neceſſary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſalvation of the World. <hi>Sed verum prius: ergo et poſterius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If the merit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> received no addition, was no wayes perfected, by the actings of thoſe who Crucified him, or by the things which he ſuffered from them, then did not the ſalvation of the World depend upon his being
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94900:27"/> actually crucified, or upon his crucifying by men, but only upon that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying, wherewith he had crucified himſelf before men came to lay hands upon him. <hi>Sed verum prius: ergo et poſterius.</hi> That the merit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was no wayes perfected or augmented by the things which he ſuffered from men, is evident; becauſe he acted or did nothing herein, or under theſe ſufferings, more then what he had done before in the inward tranſactions of his Soul; yea and would have done ſtill, or againe, whether men had Crucified him, or no.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the acceptation of the ſacrifice of <hi>Christ,</hi> depended only upon, 1. The nature, quality, and legitimateneſſe of the Sacrifice. 2. Upon the legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and dignity of the Prieſt offering. 3. (And laſtly) upon the legitimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the manner obſerved in the offering, then was not the act of thoſe who Crucified <hi>Chriſt,</hi> any wayes contributing towards the acceptation of this Sacrifice: and if ſo, the acceptation hereof with God had been the ſame (and conſequently, the ſalvation of the World, Purchaſed and Procured by it) whether men had interpoſed to Crucifie <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or no. Evident it is that they who Crucified <hi>Chriſt,</hi> neither gave legitimateneſſe to the Sacrifice: nor were any legitimate Prieſts, upon whoſe actings about the Sacrifice, the acceptation of the offering any wayes depended; nor. 3. Did they, in what they did about the Crucifying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> obſerve any legitimateneſſe of order or manner, which ſhould render the oblation acceptable with God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the acceptance of that great Sacrifice we ſpeake of, with God, depended wholly upon Chriſt Himſelf, who 1. In reſpect of his Perſon, was a legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Sacrifice to make that great attonement for the World, that was made by him. 2. In reſpect of his office, was a legitimate High Prieſt, anointed by God to offer that great Sacrifice of himſelf. 3. (And laſtly) by vertue of his Holineſſe, Love, Zeale, and all other heavenly endowments requiſite for his Office of Prieſt-hood, performed the oblation with a perfect obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all the requirements appertaining to the Law or manner of ſuch an offering. In none of all theſe had he the leaſt dependance upon thoſe who put him to death: nor ſtood he in need of their wickedneſſe in Crucifying him, to make him either Sacrifice, Prieſt, or oblation of higheſt acceptance with God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle expreſly affirmeth concerning men, that <hi>if there be firſt a willing minde, it is accepted</hi> [meaning with God] <hi>according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 12</note>. His meaning cleerely is, that where there is a cleare, perfect, and upright deſire of ſoule in any man, to perform any ſervice pleaſing unto God, but wants opportunity or meanes for the actuall or compleate performance of it, and ſhall go, in, or towards the Performance, as far as he hath opportunity or meanes to carry him, ſuch a man findes the ſame acceptance with God under theſe deficiencies, which he ſhould finde under an actuall and compleate Performance. This is that which Divines commonly expreſſe in ſaying, <hi>that God accepts the will for the deed.</hi> Now there is no reaſon to conceive or think, but that God ſhould deal in a way of as much equity and grace with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he doth with other men. Therefore ſuppoſing that there was a cleere, perfect, and intire willingneſſe, or readineſſe of minde in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to lay down his life for the World, but he had wanted an opportunity actually to have done it, (as ſuppoſe no man ſhould have appeared to take away his life from him) there is no ſufficient reaſon to think, but that he had been accepted with God upon the ſame terms under, or in reſpect of ſuch his willingneſs, or deſire, on which he is now accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under his actuall Death.</p>

(And laſtly) if it was the deepe humility, and perfect ſubjection to the Fathers Will and Pleaſure, together with thoſe other inward and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deportments of ſoule in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in, and under his ſufferings, which gave the whole and intire worth of merit and ſatisfaction unto them, then were his bare externall ſufferings conſidered a part from theſe, no wayes merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and conſequently of no abſolute neceſſity for, or towards, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the World. <hi>Sed verum prius: ergo et poſterius.</hi> The former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in this argument, is evident: becauſe nothing, whether Action, or Paſſion, can be meritorious, without ſomething in it, or relating to it, which ſhould give it the weight or worth of merit. The latter conſequence is no leſſe evident neither. For whatever, whether doings, or ſufferings, are wholly voyd of merit, though they may ſomewayes contribute towards the worke of Redemption, yet can they be no wayes eſſentiall, or of abſolute neceſſity thereunto. For the minor; neither is this much queſtionable; the Scriptures themſelves from place to place, placing the value, merit, or expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory worth of the death and ſufferings of <hi>Christ,</hi> over and beſides the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Perſon, in his innocency, meekeneſſe, humility, Perfect ſubjection to his Fathers Will, &amp;c. Let theſe Paſſages be conſidered. <hi>Heb. 9. 14. 1 Pet. 1. 19. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Heb.</hi> 7. 26, 27, 28. with many others of like import. Now certaine it is, 1. That the excellency and dignity of the Perſon of <hi>Christ,</hi> was and would have been the ſame. 2. That the Innocency, Humility, Love, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were, and would have been the ſame alſo, whether he had actually and corporally ſuffered, or no. Therefore whatſoever was Properly, Formally, or Eſſentially meritorious in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſufferings of a naturall death, and would have been in him, whether he had ſuffered ſuch a Death, or no: and conſequently the worke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption might have proſpered in his hand, whether he had thus ſuffered, or not.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded; but doth not this Doctrine ſuppoſe, or make, <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have died in vaine? yea, and contradict all thoſe Scriptures, which aſcribe the Redemption, and Salvation of men, to his Blood, Death, Croſſe, and Suffering? I anſwer; neither: it is moſt free from both theſe erroneous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties. From the former, becauſe the death of <hi>Christ</hi> is ſoveraignly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary upon ſeverall other accounts; as 1. If he ſhould not have actually yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up himſelf unto death, there being found thoſe that would, and did, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, it muſt needs have been conceived and concluded by men, that he was not truly, inwardly, and really willing and free to have laid down his life for the World: and conſequently there had been no ground, or footing for any man to believe, either that he was the Son of God, or that he was meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly qualified for the Redemption of the World. Secondly, had he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes declined actuall dying, under thoſe frequent attempts made by men to take away his life, it could not have been known (and ſo not upon any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground believed) that God the Father <hi>delivered him up to Death:</hi> and conſequently his Will and good Pleaſure concerning the ſalvation of the World by his Son, could not upon any competent terms have been believed. Thirdly, the Prophecies in the old Teſtament concerning the actuall ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not have been fullfilled. Fourthly, upon the ſaid ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as, <hi>viz.</hi> That he had an opportunity thorough the bloud thirſty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of men, to lay down his life actually, if he ſhould not have done it, that great example of his Humility, Patience, Self-deniall, Love of the Brethren even unto bloud, &amp;c. had been wanting in the Churches. Fifthly, (and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94900:28"/> laſtly) upon the ſuppoſition mentioned, the actuall dying of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neceſſary in reſpect of the inward frame and diſpoſition of his Soul, which rendred him freely willing to lay down his Life, in caſe it ſhould be required of him, at, or after ſuch a time, as his Father judged it meete to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the execution. Now ſuch a frame and diſpoſition of Heart and Soule, as this, was (as was formerly argued) abſolutely neceſſary to be found in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to qualifie him for a Redeemer: and being found in him, it could not poſſibly but produce his actuall death, when men ſhould attempt it, and God no wayes interpoſe to prevent it. Thus then you ſee cleerly, how the Doctrine, which denieth an abſolute neceſſity of <hi>Chriſts</hi> actuall and externall Death, in order to the ſalvation of the World, no wayes rendreth, or ſuppoſeth this death of his to be in vaine.</p>
            <p>Nor doth the Doctrine we now ſpeake of contradict any of thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which attribute the Redemption and Salvation of the World to his Blood, Death, Sufferings, &amp;c. For when we are ſaid to be <hi>healed by his ſtripes, 1. Pet.</hi> 2. 24. to be <hi>juſtified by his Blood, Rom. 5. 9. to have Redemption thorough his Blood, Eph.</hi> 1. 7. &amp;c. It no wayes ſuppoſeth or implies, that the liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or materiall ſhedding of his <hi>Blood</hi> by men was ſimply and abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, either to the juſtification, or redemption of men, but only that a ſhedding of it, by himſelf, ſpiritually, in that great Act of Reſignation of it to be ſhed by men, which paſſed and was tranſacted inwardly in his Soule, whether it had been externally ſhed by men, or no, was ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary thereunto. There is ſcarce any Phraſe or Idiome of ſpeech more frequent in Scripture, then to mention and ſpeake of an act ſimply, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, as performed and done, when the doing of it hath been fully reſolved, concluded, or conſented unto in the heart and ſoule, whether ever it be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and externally done, or no. Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the ſame Verſe is twice ſaid to have <hi>offered up</hi> his ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 11. 17.</note>; only becauſe he was inwardly, really, and fully willing to have <hi>offered him up</hi> literally, which yet (we know) he did not. So a man is ſaid to <hi>forſake all he hath</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 14. 33.</note>, when he is inwardly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly willing and reſolved to <hi>forſake all</hi> [literally, and actually] when he ſhall be called to it, whether he be ever ſo called, or no. In this Phraſe of ſpeech God is ſaid to have <hi>given</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> unto the <hi>Iſraelites, Ioſ.</hi> 1. 3. when as he had only purpoſed or reſolved to give it unto them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears Ver. 6. So to <hi>have ſaved us, 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 9. only becauſe of his full purpoſe to <hi>ſave us;</hi> upon our believing. So againe to have <hi>rejected Saul from being King, 1 Sam.</hi> 15. 23. only becauſe he was fully purpoſed <hi>to reject</hi> him, upon his impenitence in his rebellious courſe: for evident it is, that <hi>Saul</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to injoy his Kingdome, a conſiderable ſpace of time, after it was ſaid that God had <hi>rejected him from being King.</hi> In like manner he is ſaid, <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. 13. To have <hi>establiſhed</hi> (for ſo <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> tranſlates out of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, viz. <hi>ſtabilierat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and our former Engliſh Tranſlators, <hi>had eſtabliſhed</hi>) the Kingdome of <hi>Saul upon Iſrael for ever,</hi> only becauſe he was purpoſed to do it, and that conditionally too, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the good behaviour of himſelf, and his Poſterity, in the Throne. It were eaſie to multiply inſtances in this kinde even unto wearineſſe. In like conſtruction of ſpeech, <hi>Christ</hi> may be ſaid to have <hi>given his Fleſh, layd down his Life, ſhed his Blood</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the World, juſtification of men, &amp;c. (and conſequently, the World be ſaid to be <hi>redeemed,</hi> and men juſtified by his <hi>Blood, Death, Croſse,</hi> &amp;c.) onely becauſe he was freely willing, unfeignedly ready and prepared to doe all theſe actually, when the Providence of God, and the wickedneſſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94900:29"/> of men ſhould afford him an an opportunity to do them. Nor can it be ſaid, that (in ſuch a ſence) he ſhould ever the leſſe have <hi>given his Fleſh, layd down his Life, ſhed his Blood</hi> for the ſalvation of the World, then now he hath done, in caſe the Providence of God, and wickedneſſe of men, ſhould never have conſpired or agreed about the taking away his Life from him. It was his <hi>Blood,</hi> as ſhed by himſelf, not by men; it was his Life, as <hi>laid down</hi> by himſelf, not as taken from him by men; it was his <hi>Fleſh,</hi> as <hi>given</hi> or offered by himſelf, not as ſacrificed by wicked men, which produc'd thoſe glorious and bleſſed effects, the Redemption, Juſtification, and Salvation of the World. Now <hi>Christ,</hi> to ſhed his <hi>Blood,</hi> in ſuch a ſence as he ſhed it; to <hi>lay down his Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in ſuch a manner, as he by any act or conſent of his concurred and acted towards the <hi>laying of it down;</hi> and ſo to <hi>give his Fleſh,</hi> as he <hi>gave</hi> it, needed not the malice, violence, or bloudy injuſtice of men; but did all this, performed all theſe acts within his own ſphere; yea, and had performed them, before the leaſt drop of his Bloud was ſpilt by men: and conſequently the Redemption and Salvation of the World were provided for by him in all things eſſentiall, and ſimply neceſſary thereunto, before either <hi>Herod,</hi> or <hi>Filate</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or the <hi>Jewes</hi> interpoſed with any of their counſels, or ingagements, for the Crucifying of him.</p>
            <p>Thus then we ſee what the <hi>Christians</hi> mean, in ſaying, that <hi>Herod and Pilate, with the Gentiles and People of Iſrael gathered together to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the hand and counſell of God had determined before to be done;</hi> viz. to act towards, in, and about the Death and Crucifying of <hi>Christ,</hi> to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt (<gap reason="foreign">

(For that the Permiſſive Decree of God, doth not import the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, or neceſſity of event in things ſo Decreed, is afterwards proved in this Chapter <note n="a" place="margin">Sect. 20.</note>). It is a form of ſpeech frequent in the Scriptures, to ſpeak of things probable, or likely to come to paſſe, as if they ſhould, or would, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and certainly come to paſſe: and ſo again to uſe the infinitive Mood in a potentiall ſence, or ſignification. An inſtance of the former, we have, Deut. 13. 11. <hi>And all Iſrael ſhall heare, and feare, and ſhall do no more, any ſuch wickedneſse as this is, among you.</hi> The meaning is not, that it ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly thus come to paſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That no <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> hearing of the judgment executed upon the idolatrous Seducer, would ever commit the like wickedneſſe afterwards; but that the hearing of ſuch a ſevere courſe taken with ſuch an offender, ſhould be a probable and likely means to preſerve others from the like wickedneſſe.

               </gap>. &amp;c. i. e. <hi>And that ſignes and wonders</hi> MAY BE DONE by the Name, &amp;c. So that whereas in the Scripture in debate, we have the Originall, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, tranſlated, <hi>to be done,</hi> as if the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were, that <hi>the hand and counſell of God</hi> had poſitively and concluſively <hi>determined,</hi> that all thoſe things ſhould be done, which now were done by <hi>Herod, Pilate,</hi> &amp;c. about the Crucifying of <hi>Christ;</hi> it might, as properly, with as much conſonancy to the Scripture Dialect and Phraſe elſewhere, and (queſtionleſſe) with farre better agreement with the truth, be rendered, MIGHT BE DONE. And then the ſEnce of the whole Paſſage imports no more but this, that <hi>Herod, Pilate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were gathered together</hi> to do the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of what God had long before, even from eternity, graciouſly and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientially <hi>determined</hi> to permit and ſuffer them to doe, in, and about the Death and Crucifying of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So then here is nothing in this Scripture to prove, that God peremptorily decreed or determined before hand the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>Herod, Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or the <hi>Jewes,</hi> or by any other Perſons; but only that in order to his great and bleſſed deſigne of ſaving the World, he thus <hi>Decreed,</hi> that either theſe, or any other (in caſe theſe had not done it) ſhould be at liberty to Perpetrate this great wickedneſſe, and that he would not by his <hi>hand</hi> or Power interpoſe to hinder them, in caſe they ſhould attempt it; which he from eternity foreſaw, and certainly knew that they would.</p>
            <p>This ſence of the place is fully confirmed from all theſe and ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions in Scripture: <hi>Who was</hi> DELIVERED <hi>up</hi> [meaning by God] <hi>for our offences</hi>

Such paſsages as theſe evidently ſhew, that God went no further in any of his Determinations, or Decrees about the actuall Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but only to a <hi>delivering of him up. i. e.</hi> to a leaving of him un-guarded, unprotected, for wicked men to <hi>doe with him</hi> (thus far) <hi>even what they</hi> liſt; not to any neceſsitating of any perſon, or perſons whatſoever, to lay violent hands upon him.</p>

He did not only foreſee, that <hi>Saul</hi> would come down to <hi>Keilah,</hi> which he did; but alſo that the <hi>Lords of Keilah</hi> would have <hi>delivered David into Sauls hand,</hi> in caſe he had ſtayed there till <hi>Sauls</hi> comming, and demanding of him; which yet they did not, becauſe they were prevented of the opportunity, by <hi>Davids</hi> departure from them before. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 11, 12. So that in this ſence God may be ſaid to <hi>determine,</hi> what will, or ſhall, be done in the World by men; not by <hi>determining,</hi> or decreeing to bow, or bend their wills by any immediate or phyſicall influx, or acting of his Power upon them, much leſſe by neceſsitating or compelling them to their reſpective elections; but by <hi>determining</hi> or decreeing, either to ſuffer them to remaine ſo, and ſo, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or inclin'd, and under the Power and guidance of ſuch, and ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which he certainly foreſeeth that they will drinke in; or elſe to put new Principles of light into them, by the influence whereof he alſo cleerly foreſeeth that the tenor and frame of their wills and affections will freely alter, and change; and with all, to give being to ſuch and ſuch, circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, providences, and occaſions, which have ſuch or ſuch an aſpect upon, or reference unto, them, in ſuch, or ſuch, a Poſture.

As for example, that the ſame ground, with the ſame labour, coſt, and skill of the Husbandman beſtowed on it, doth not yeild a like proportion of increaſe one year, which it doth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo againe, that the ſame fruit-bearing Trees, are barren one year, and well-bearing another; that the Seas are Pacifique and commodious for Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage at one time, in ſuch parts and places of them, as when ſuch, and ſuch Ships, with ſuch and ſuch Perſons in them, paſſe thorough them, where they are turbulent and dangerous at another time, when ſuch and ſuch other Ships, and Perſons in them, paſſe the ſame way, (with many more particulars of like conſideration) the reaſon (doubtleſſe) of the variety and diverſity of occurrences, or effects, in this kinde, is not alwayes to be reſolved, either <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſim,</hi> or <hi>conjunction,</hi> only into the native Properties of the Cauſes, whether mediately, or immediately producing them, or into the ordinary and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concurrence of God, with theſe Cauſes, for, or in producing them; but there is ſomewhat a more particular hand of the great Ruler of the World, which formes and faſhions them in ſuch different ſhapes; and that in order to ſuch and ſuch ends, which though ſometimes apprehenſible enough, yet for the moſt part are very hard for men to call by their Names. Only this remaines true, that in ſuch occurrences and events, as thoſe now ſpecified, notwithſtanding that great diverſity found between them, yet ordinarily all Particular Cauſes intereſſed in the Production of them, act in a regular and due conformity to their reſpective Natures, and Properties, and are not forced or turned out their way by any immediate Power or interpoſall of God. And that which he doth in order to a diverſification, when the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is Preter-naturall, and ſignally from him, conſiſts either in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of, or a ſubſtraction from, the number of Cauſes, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe of nature, and ordinary Providence, would have joyned in raiſing the effect, or elſe in ſuſpending, either in whole or in part, or in augmenting the operating vertue, of one cauſe, or more preſent with thoſe, which together raiſe and produce the effect. Which ſuſpenſion and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, though in a ſence they may be called miraculous, yet are they not direct or perfect miracles, partly becauſe they are not ſo obvious to any of the outward ſenſes, partly alſo, becauſe, though they be unuſuall and rare, compared with the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94900:31"/>7. Concerning ſuch occurrences and caſuall events, wherein, or whereby,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> any creature ſuffers loſſe, either of being, or of well-being, in what kinde, or degree ſoever, neither are theſe <hi>determined</hi> by God, though he takes ſpeciall knowledge of them both before, and when they come to paſſe, and contrives them accordingly to their moſt appropriate ends. When our Saviour reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Diſciples, that <hi>a Sparrow ſhall not fall to the ground (i. e.</hi> be taken, kil'd, or hurt,) <hi>without his Heavenly Father;</hi> his meaning is not to aſſert a particular Decree or <hi>determination</hi> in God, concerning the death, or hurt, of every <hi>Sparrow,</hi> that either dieth, or receiveth harme; but to ſhew, that God is vigilant and carefull in his Rule and Government of the World; and taketh exact notice how his Creatures ſuffer, or are diminiſhed. It is more proper (of the two) and neerer to the truth, to ſay and hold, that God <hi>determineth</hi> the preſervation, or keeping alive of thoſe <hi>Sparrowes,</hi> which <hi>fall</hi> not <hi>to the ground,</hi> then that he <hi>determineth</hi> the <hi>falling to the grounds</hi> of every one that ſo <hi>falleth.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the object of Gods <hi>determinations</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, is only that which is good, whereas things indifferent, and things that are evill, are the object of his knowledge, as well as that, which is good. But of this more hereafter. So when any mans Perſon, Houſe, or Goods, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd, or hurt, by Fire, there is no competent ground to ſay or thinke, that any of theſe were <hi>determined</hi> by God, or that they might not have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. For certaine it is, that he Decreed not, either the negligence or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, nor yet the malice, of thoſe, who thorough either the one, or the other, were the Authors of ſuch accidents.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, yea but the permiſſion of ſuch accidents as theſe, is good:<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> otherwiſe God would not permit them to be. And if ſo, then ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion may be the object of Gods <hi>Determination</hi> and Decree. And if God Decreeth the Permiſſion of a thing, doth not this include, or ſuppoſe, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that it ſhall, will, or muſt come to paſſe? If ſo, it is as much <hi>determined</hi> or neceſſitated by Gods, Permiſſive Decree, as if it had been directly and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily decreed by him; To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>It is indeed the judgement of ſome learned men, that the purpoſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Twiſſe.</hi>
               </note> of God to permit or ſuffer ſuch, or ſuch a thing to be done, or ſuch or ſuch an accident to come to paſſe, ſuppoſeth a neceſſity (at leaſt a ſyllogiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or conſequentiall neceſſity) of the comming of it to paſſe. But that the truth lieth on the other ſide of the way, appears by the light of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. If whatſoever God hath Decreed, or intendeth, to permit to come to paſſe in any caſe, upon any terms, or any ſuppoſition whatſoever, ſhould by vertue of ſuch an intention or Decree, neceſſarily come to paſſe, then all things poſſible to be, (or at leaſt ten thouſand things more then ever ſhall be) muſt be, yea and this neceſſarily. For (doubtleſſe) God hath Decreed, and intendeth, to leave naturall Cauſes, generally, to their naturall and proper Operations, and Productions; yea and voluntary Cauſes alſo, under a Power, and at liberty, to act ten thouſand things more, then ever they will do, or ſhall do. For example; God intendeth, and hath Decreed, to permit, that fire ſhall burne, what combuſtible matter ſoever it ſhall take hold of, or that ſhall be caſt into it; that one ſparke of it falling into a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell of dried Gun-powder, ſhould ſuddainly fire it, &amp;c. but it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from hence, that therefore every thing that is combuſtible in the World, ſhall be burnt with Fire; or that every barrell of dry Gun-powder ſhall be blown up with ſparkes of Fire falling into them. So (in the inſtance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned) God had Decreed to permit <hi>the Lords of Keilah</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94900:32"/> up <hi>David</hi> into <hi>Sauls</hi> hand, in caſe he had ſtayed in their City, till <hi>Sauls</hi> comming to demand him: this is evident from the Text <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 12.</note>. But it did not follow from this Permiſſive Decree of God, that therefore theſe <hi>Lords</hi> muſt neceſſarily deliver up <hi>David</hi> into <hi>Sauls</hi> hand: for we know they did it not. So likewiſe God hath Decreed to permit any man to deſtroy the life of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other<note place="margin">Vitae alienae Dominus eſt, quiſquis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptor eſt ſuae. Sen.</note> whom he meets with (I meane, in reſpect of a naturall Power to doe the execution) but it followeth not from hence, that therefore every man muſt neceſſarily murther, or deſtroy the life of his Brother that commeth in his way. So that evident it is, that no Decree of God whatſoever, which is ſimply and purely Permiſſive, doth import any neceſſity at all of the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, or comming to paſſe, of the thing ſo Decreed. God permitted <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>eate of every Tree in the Garden of Eden (the Tree of the knowledge of good and evill,</hi> only excepted <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 2. 16. 17.</note>) and therefore certainly had Decreed, or Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Permiſſion: yet was not <hi>Adam</hi> any wayes neceſſitated by any vertue or influence of this Decree upon him, to <hi>eate of every</hi> of theſe <hi>Trees;</hi> nor is it in the leaſt degree credible, that ever he did <hi>eate of every</hi> of them, nor yet of any one of them, but only that, which was prohibited unto him, his ejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of this Garden following ſo ſuddenly after this Patent, or Permiſſion, granted unto him. The reaſon why no Decree of God, that is purely and barely permiſſive, either induceth or ſuppoſeth any neceſſity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to paſſe, of what is only ſo Decreed, is this. Firſt, becauſe no ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree doth any wayes intereſſe God to any manner of interpoſall, either by his wiſdom, power, or providence in what kinde ſoever, towards the effecting or bringing to paſſe of what is ſo decreed. So that ſuch events, which are no otherwiſe Decreed by God, then thus, are in the ſame poſture of contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the ſame poſſibility of being, or not being, wherein they would have been, had there been no ſuch Decree at all concerning them. Secondly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any ſuch Decree in God ſuppoſe a futurity of ſuch a concurrence of Cauſes ſimply requiſite and neceſſary for the bringing of things, ſo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, to paſſe, which will actually bring them to paſſe. Though God hath Decreed, that a ſpark, or coale of Fire, falling, <hi>i. e.</hi> in caſe it ſhall fall, into a barrell of Gun-powder, ſhall fire it, yet it doth not follow from hence, that he hath Decreed that any ſuch ſparke, or coale, ſhall fall into it; without which notwithſtanding the effect Decreed, <hi>viz.</hi> the firing of this powder, will not come to paſſe. Or if it be ſaid, that God hath Decreed that ſuch a ſpark, or coale, ſhall fall into the ſaid barrell of powder, now is not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree barely permiſsive, but operative and aſſertive, and ſuch which ingageth the Decreer to interpoſe effectually for the bringing of the thing Decreed to paſse. But ſuch Decrees as this, in matters of that nature, we deny to be in God.</p>
            <p>If it be yet further objected; yea but all events, and whatſoever commeth<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> to paſse at any time, in any place, or with relation to any perſon whatſoever, are fore-ſeene, and fore-known by God. And if ſo, then is there an abſolute and unavoydable, neceſsity of their comming to paſse: otherwiſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God ſhall be but conjecturall, obnoxious to error and miſtake, not certain, or infallible. To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. By conceſsion; <hi>viz.</hi> that the knowledge of God (for fore-knowledge, if we ſpeake properly, is not competible to him <note n="a" place="margin">

But,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:94900:32"/>2. I anſwer further (by way of exception) that notwithſtanding the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the knowledge of God concerning things, that dayly and hourly come to paſſe, and that will come to paſſe hereafter, yet there is no more, no other neceſſity of their comming to paſſe, in reſpect of ſuch his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then there would, or ſhould, have been, in caſe no ſuch knowledge were, or had been, in him. For certaine it is, that no knowledge, as ſuch, hath any influence at all upon the object, or thing known, to cauſe it to be, or not to be <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Non ideo pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavit Adam, quia Deus hoc ſuturum nove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat; ſed praeſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit Deus, quaſi Deus, quod ille erat propria vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate factu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.

            <p>If it be replied; yea, but if God knowes, that ſuch and ſuch things will come to paſſe, is there not a neceſſity of their comming to paſs: or otherwiſe, muſt not the knowledge of God prove abortive, and be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with error?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, no: if the events ſuppoſed to be knowne by God before their<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> comming to paſse, be contingent, or at leaſt ſuch, in the Production where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<note place="margin">

               </note> the wills of men muſt ſome wayes or other, interpoſe, if ever they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, (of which kinde of events only we now ſpeake) the certainty of the knowledge of God may be ſalved, and yet no abſolute neceſsity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to paſse of ſuch events be ſuppoſed. The reaſon is, becauſe at the ſame time, when God ſeeth, or knoweth, that they will come to paſse, he ſeeth and knoweth alſo, that there is no neceſsity they ſhould come to paſse, but that they may well be prevented. In which reſpect, in caſe they ſhould not come to paſse, the knowledge of God ſhould ſuffer no defeature, or diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If yet it be ſaid; yea but when it is ſuppoſed, that God knoweth that ſuch,<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> or ſuch, an event will come to paſſe, if it ſhould be ſuppoſed withall, that he knoweth it may not come to paſſe, or that it may come to paſſe otherwiſe, then according to this knowledge, doth not this ſuppoſe or imply a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in God of the weakneſs or deficiency of his knowledge?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, no; but rather the contrary; <hi>viz.</hi> a conſciouſneſſe in him of the ſtrength and perfection of his knowledge. For he that knoweth not that contingent and free-working Cauſes, which way ſoever they ſhall act in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to any particular event, might yet act otherwiſe, or ſuſpend their actings, is certainly defective in knowledge. And if God did not as well know, that there is a Poſſibility of the non-futurity, or of the not comming to paſſe of ſuch contingent events, which he knoweth will come to paſſe, as well as he certainly knoweth that they will come to paſse, he ſhould be defective in his knowledge concerning the Nature and Property of contingent and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working Cauſes: in as much as this is their Nature and Property (as hath been ſaid) to be at liberty in reference to particular actings, to act one way, as well as another, or elſe to ſuſpend their action. Indeed if it ſhould be ſaid, or thought, that any event WILL not, or SHALL not, come to paſse, which God knoweth before hand will come to paſse, this would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port an obnoxiouſneſs unto error in the knowledge, or fore-knowledge, of God. But to ſay, or think, that ſuch an event, whoſe future comming to paſse God knoweth, MAY, notwithſtanding this knowledge of his, not come to paſse, reflects no diſhonour or diſparagement at all upon his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note n="a" place="margin">

Secondly, being conſcious to himſelf, with what excellency of Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Power, the great Body of Nature with all the Parts and Members of it, was at firſt rais'd, built, fram'd, and temper'd by himſelf, he knows there is no need for him either to add to, or to take from, or to alter any thing (ordinarily) in her courſe.

               </gap>d, the truth herein is. For 1. if fore-knowledge were Properly and formally in God, then might Predeſtination, Election, Reprobation, and many other things be Properly and Formally in him alſo; in as much as theſe are, in the Letter and Propriety of them, as competible unto him, as foreknowledge. Nor can there be any reaſon given ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a difference. But unpoſſible it is, that there ſhould be any Plurality of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ings whatſoever, in their diſtinct and Proper natures, and formalities, in God, the infinite, ſimplicity of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and being, with open mouth gain-ſaying it. Secondly, if fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge were Properly, or Formally in God, there ſhould be ſomewhat in him corruptible, or changeable. For that which is ſuppoſed to be ſuch a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in him to day, by the morrow, ſuppoſe the thing, or event fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, ſhould in the interim actually come to paſſe, muſt needs ceaſe, and be changed; in as much as there can be no fore-knowledge of things that are preſent, the adequate and appropriate object of this knowledge, (in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of it) being <hi>res futura<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſomewhat that is to come. Thirdly, (and laſtly) there is nothing in the Creature univocally and formally the ſame,<note place="margin">

The Reaſon is; becauſe then, there muſt either be ſomewhat finite in God, or ſomewhat infinite in the Creature: both which are unpoſſible. But if Preſcience or fore-knowledge, being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and Formally in the Creature, ſhould be Properly and Formally alſo in God, there ſhould be ſomewhat in the Creature, univocally and formally the ſame, with ſomewhat, which is in God. Therefore certainly there is no fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, properly ſo called, in God.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that this argument lieth as ſtrong againſt the Propriety<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> as of <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> in God; in as much as <hi>knowledge,</hi> is every whit as Properly and Formally in the Creature, as <hi>fore-knowledge;</hi> I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>True it is, there is no <hi>knowledge</hi> neither in God, according to the preciſe and formall notion of <hi>knowledge,</hi> or in ſuch a ſence, wherein it is found in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94900:34"/> men. And this the firſt and laſt of the three Reaſons mentioned, doe infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly demonſtrate. <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the Creature is a Principle or habit, really and eſſentially diſtinct from the ſubject, or ſoule, where it reſideth: yea and is capable of augmentation and diminution therein, and of ſeparation from it. Whereas that which is called <hi>knowledge</hi> in God, neither differs really, or eſſentially from his nature, or from himſelf, but is really one and the ſame thing with him (as will further appeare in the following <hi>Chapter</hi>) nor is it either capable of growth, or of decay, or of ſeparation. Only in this reſpect, <hi>knowledge,</hi> of the two, is more properly attributeable unto God, then <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> viz. becauſe <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> in the proper notion, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall conception of it, includes, or ſuppoſeth a liableneſſe to a change or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration (<hi>viz.</hi> upon the comming to paſſe of the thing <hi>fore-knowne,</hi> which muſt of neceſſity come to paſſe in time) whereas <hi>knowledge</hi> imports nothing, but what may be Permanent and Perpetuall, and ſo is (of the two) more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriable unto him, who changeth not.</p>
            <p>But though neither <hi>knowledge,</hi> nor <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> can in ſtrictneſſe and<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> formality of notion be aſcribed unto God, yet ſince both the one and the other are frequently in Scripture attributed unto him, neceſſary it is that we make inquiry into the Grounds and Reaſons of ſuch attributions. For it is no wayes credible but that the Holy Ghoſt in all ſuch expreſſions, did intend to informe the World of ſomewhat, and that according to truth, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. Now the method and way (in generall) whereby to diſcover, upon what grounds or Reaſons the Holy Ghoſt attributeth ſuch things unto <hi>God,</hi> which yet are not Formally or Properly competible to him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently what it is in <hi>God,</hi> of which, by ſuch expreſſions he deſireth to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the knowledge unto us, is this; to conſider the Reſpective natures, the different manner of operation, the divers effects, or ordinary conſequents, of thoſe things, in the Creature, whet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r they be Actions, Paſſions, Habits, Parts, or whatſoever, which are upon ſuch terms attributed unto <hi>God.</hi> For ſtill we ſhall finde ſomething or other proceeding from <hi>God,</hi> or done by him, which holds proportion and correſpondeth with ſome, or other, one, or more, of the ordinary effects or conſequents, of thoſe things in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are ſo attributed unto him. And the intent of the Holy Ghoſt in aſcribing ſuch things unto <hi>God,</hi> which are proper only to the Creature, is, to make known to us, that the Divine Eſſence, or <hi>God</hi> himſelf, hath that eminently, after a tranſcendent and moſt perfect manner, in his nature or being, which alwayes inableth him, and (in reſpect of ſome particulars,) upon occaſion rendereth him actually willing, to expreſſe himſelf in ſuch kinde of actions or effects, wherein the Creature is wont to expreſſe it ſelfe upon occaſion, out of, and by means of, ſuch Principles, or inſtruments of action (being in the Propriety, or Formality of their reſpective natures, in them) which are aſcribed unto <hi>God.</hi> As for example, to give the World knowledge, that the Divine Nature can, and upon juſt occaſion will, yea and doth many times, expreſſe it ſelfe after ſuch a manner, and with ſuch a kinde of effect, as men uſe to expreſſe themſelves out of anger, as <hi>viz.</hi> by Reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Expoſtulating, Withdrawing themſelves, Striking, Puniſhing, and the like, the Holy Ghoſt oft aſcribeth the Paſſion, or Impreſſion of <hi>Anger,</hi> unto God. There is the ſame conſideration of all thoſe other Creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affections, as of Love, Zeal, Grief, Sorrow, Repentance, Delight, Mercy, Compaſſion, &amp;c. And ſo alſo of all thoſe organicall parts or members of an humane body, as Eyes, Eares, Hands, Heart, &amp;c. which are ſo frequently
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94900:34"/> in the Scriptures attributed unto <hi>God.</hi> Theſe reſpective attributions <hi>give the light of this knowledge of God</hi> unto the World, that the Divine Nature, though moſt ſingly, ſimply, moſt undividedly, and indiviſibly <hi>One,</hi> is yet able out of the infinite perfection of it, to act all that variety, and diverſity of action and effect, which the Creature is wont to act, out of ſuch affections, and by means of ſuch organs, or members, reſpectively.</p>
            <p>To come in to the particular in hand. The Scripture is wont to aſcribe<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> 
               <hi>knowledge</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> to inform the World, that, what kinde of contentment ſoever men reape, or receive, by meanes of any <hi>knowledge</hi> of things, which they have, and that what regular uſe, or advantage ſoever they make, or are capable of making in any kinde, of ſuch <hi>Knowledge, God</hi> receiveth the like contentment by, maketh, when, and as he pleaſeth, the ſame or the like uſe of the infinite perfection of his nature or being. For example: men of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and of underſtanding, ſo far as their <hi>knowledge</hi> extendeth, are free from errors, miſtakes, and other inconveniences, in reference to the things <hi>known,</hi> whereunto men that are ignorant are expoſed. Again, men that have <hi>knowledge</hi> of things, are hereby according to the meaſure and extent of this <hi>knowledge,</hi> inabled to manage and order their affaires to their beſt advantage, either in a way of profit, or of Repute and Honor: yea and being otherwiſe furniſhed with opportunity and meanes for ſuch a purpoſe, to communicate and impart the ſame light of <hi>knowledge</hi> unto others, which ſhineth in, and to, themſelves. In like manner, <hi>knowledge,</hi> yea the <hi>knowledge of all things,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 20.</note> is in Scripture aſſerted unto God, not becauſe he <hi>knoweth</hi> them after the ſame ſpecificall manner, or upon the ſame ſpecificall terms, upon which men <hi>know</hi> or underſtand, the things <hi>known</hi> by them (for as <hi>the Lord ſeeth not as men ſeeth</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Sam. 16, 7</note>, ſo neither doth he <hi>know,</hi> as man <hi>knoweth</hi>) but becauſe, from, and by means of, the infinite perfection of his Nature, 1. He injoyeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with a ſcientificall contentment, (I mean, with ſuch a kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, as <hi>knowing</hi> men injoy, or might injoy, by means of their <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>): and, 2. Becauſe by the ſame means, he is inabled to manage, order, and diſpoſe of all things, to the beſt advantage and improvement for his own glory, and for what other end beſides he pleaſeth: and, 3. (and laſtly) becauſe he hath an opportunity alſo thereby, to impart the knowledge of what things ſoever he pleaſeth, unto his Creature.</p>
            <p>By what hath been ſaid, it is no matter of difficulty, either to conceive,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> or to declare, in what ſence, or upon what ground, one, or more, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures attribute <hi>preſcience</hi> alſo, or <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> unto God. For look what regular conveniency, opportunity, or advantage in any kinde, the <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> of things in men, affordeth unto them, the like doth the infinite perfection of the Divine Nature exhibit and afford unto him. Men who have the certaine <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> that ſuch and ſuch things will come to paſſe at ſuch, or ſuch a time, if they any wayes relate unto them, or be capable of being wrought to ſuch a Relation, beſides the inward contentment of ſuch <hi>knowledge,</hi> have an opportunity thereby, not only of making known before hand unto their friends, or others, that at ſuch a time ſuch things will come to paſſe (for this they may do, whether the things <hi>fore-knowne,</hi> doe any wayes concerne them, or no) and by this meanes gaine the repute of being Propheticall, or otherwiſe very underſtanding and diſcerning men; but alſo of contriving and ordering other things in the meane time, ſo, and after ſuch a manner, that the things <hi>fore-knowne,</hi> when they come to paſſe, ſhall come to paſſe with more conveniency or advantage unto them, then otherwiſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94900:35"/> they could have done. Upon ſuch conſiderations as theſe, the <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> of things, yea of all things, that are future, is by the Scriptures aſcribed unto God; <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe thorough the infinite perfection of his Eſſence and and Being; he, 1. Injoyes a delight or contentment anſwerable to that, of <hi>fore-knowing</hi> men, by means of this their <hi>knowledge.</hi> 2. He is able to impart before hand at what diſtance of time he pleaſeth, either to his Saints (his Friends) or others, ſuch particularities, of what is hid in the womb of time, as himſelf judgeth meete to be upon ſuch terms as theſe revealed. 3. (and laſtly) he is able alſo providentially to diſpoſe of all ſuch things to the beſt advantage, both for his own glory, and the benefit of thoſe, who ſhall be found worthy of this great intereſt in him.</p>
            <p>From the Rule that hath been given, and the explication made according<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> thereunto, for a right underſtanding, how, and in what ſence, and upon what grounds, both <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> are in Scripture tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto God, a cleere light ſhineth, whereby to diſcover, how, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what gounds alſo, <hi>Deſires, Purpoſes, Intentions,</hi> or <hi>Decrees,</hi> in one kinde or other, are by the ſame authority veſted in God: as likewiſe how they differ both from his <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge.</hi> That <hi>Deſires, Intentions, Purpoſes,</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> as well as <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> are only <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrope-pathetically</hi> aſcribed unto God, not <hi>formally,</hi> the former part of this Chapter (I preſume) hath given the tantamont of many demonſtrations. So that cleerly and diſtinctly to underſtand, how, and in what ſence they are in Scripture, attributed unto him, inquiry muſt be made, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation had, how they are wont to affect, or ingage men; after what manner, and upon what terms men are uſually acted, and drawn forth by them. Only before we come to the Explication hereof, this is to be remembred, by way of caution, that though there alwayes be (as hath been ſaid) a Ground or Reaſon, one, or more, for that attribution of humane actions, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, members, &amp;c. which the Scriptures ſo frequently make unto God, which Reaſon is ſtill founded in a certaine Proportion or Similitude found between the Nature of God, and the nature of man, in reſpect of the things ſo attributed unto him; yet is it not neceſſary, that all things accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or relating unto thoſe affections, or impreſſions in men, which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto God, ſhould be parallel'd in him, or have ſomething in his nature correſponding to them.

To exemplifie our Caution in a particular or two: Anger, as it is incident unto, and ſometimes as it is inherent in, men, is obnoxious to be attended with unſeemely behaviour, inconſiderate and unjuſt actions, &amp;c. Yet it doth not follow from hence, that becauſe God is ſaid to be <hi>angry,</hi> therefore there is that in his nature, which renders him obnoxious in either of theſe kinds. It is a ſufficient ground of the attribution of this Paſſion, or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto him, that out of the perfection of his ſimple Eſſence, or Nature, he doth any thing upon occaſion, which is proper or frequent, for men, being angry, to do; as that he ſharply expoſtulates, or reproves, that he ſmites thoſe who provoke him, with any ſevere ſtroke of judgement, or the like, &amp;c. So again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expectation in men is alwayes attended with an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94900:35"/> that the thing expected will indeed come to paſſe; no man expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which he knows certainly will never come to paſſe; yet it doth not follow from hence, that becauſe expectation is aſcribed unto God, therefore he muſt not know but that the thing expected by him, will come to paſſe. It is a ſufficient ground of aſcribing <hi>expectancy</hi> unto him, that out of the perfection of his ſimple eſſence, or nature, he ſometimes deporteth himſelf, as men under expectation are wont to do, though it be but in ſome one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; as that he apprehendeth a probability or likelihood, in reſpect of means, motives, and ingagements, that the thing, which he is ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, will come to paſſe; notwithſtanding he certainly knoweth withall, that what he is ſaid in this kinde to expect, will, all that probability or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood notwithſtanding, never come to paſſe. Inſtances hereof we have, <hi>Eſa. 5. 2. 4. 7. Mat.</hi> 21. 37, 38, 39. &amp;c. Take yet one example more for the better underſtanding of the premiſed Caution. Purpoſes and intentions, where they are in the letter, and in their Propriety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in men, are alwayes found in conjunction with a ſuppoſall, that the things purpoſed or intended, ſhall, or will, be effected; no man ever intending or purpoſing that, which he certainly knows before hand never ſhall, or will, be effected. But it doth not follow from hence, that when Purpoſes or intentions are attributed unto God, they muſt needs be thus attended; I meane, with a ſuppoſition, or expectance, that the things ſaid to be purpoſed or intended by him, ſhall, or will, come to paſſe.

If inſtead of <hi>intention,</hi> he had ſaid, <hi>Decree,</hi> thus: <hi>All men are bound to believe, that God, being Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, cannot faile, or fall ſhort in any Decree,</hi> ſo as not to be able to put it in execution, Reaſon and Truth had greeted each other in ſuch a ſaying. But God may be ſaid (as we ſhall ſee further anon) to purpoſe or intend things, in caſe he affordeth means that are proper, and ſufficient to bring them to paſſe, eſpecially if he commands them to be uſed accordingly; this being a diſpenſation of like conſideration and nature with the deportment of men, who are wont to provide a ſufficiency of means (at leaſt ſo apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them) for the effecting of what they purpoſe or intend. So that to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus: <hi>God intendeth not the ſalvation of all men, becauſe he certainly knoweth that all men will not be ſaved, no wiſe man ever intending that, which he certainly knows before-hand ſhall never be effected,</hi> is to reaſon weakly, and upon a falſe ſuppoſition; <hi>viz.</hi> that purpoſes and intentions are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto God in reſpect of all particulars, or under all circumſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are accompanied in men: whereas ſuch attributions are ſufficiently ſalved (as hath been ſhewed) in the Analogy and Similitude of one Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar only.</p>
            <p>Yet before we can conveniently come at our intended explication, how,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> and in what reſpect, or ſence, <hi>Deſires, Purpoſes, Intentions,</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> are by Scripture aſsignment transferred upon God, neceſſary it is that the difference between them in point of Signification and Propriety of import, together with the ſignification of ſome other terms of neer conſideration with them, be examined, and cleerly ſtated. For that theſe words, <hi>Deſire, Purpoſe, Intention,</hi> and <hi>Decree,</hi> doe not preciſely ſignifie one and the ſame thing, is out of queſtion: nor are they aſcribed unto God in one, and the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94900:36"/> ſame ſignification, or reſpect: though it is true, there is a word, frequently alſo aſcribed unto him (I mean, the word, <hi>will</hi>) which in the latitude of the ſignification of it, comprehendeth them all; yea and ſome other too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe. For what God more properly may be ſaid to <hi>Deſire,</hi> he is in a more generall terme, often ſaid to, <hi>will:</hi> ſo againe, what in more propriety and ſtrictneſſe of expreſsion, he might be ſaid (and ſometimes is ſaid) to <hi>Purpoſe, Intend, Decree,</hi> and to command or perſwade unto, he is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſaid to WILL. So that this word, <hi>Will,</hi> when it is attributed unto God, muſt be differenced in point of ſence and ſignification, <hi>pro ſubjecta materia,</hi> according to the different exigency of the context, and matter in hand, in ſuch places, where it is reſpectively uſed, (as we ſhall ſhew preſently.) But to the foure terms mentioned;</p>
            <p>Firſt, to <hi>deſire,</hi> according to the Preciſe and ſtrict import of the word, as<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> it is appropriable unto, and found in, men, ſignifies only an act of appetency in the heart, or ſoule of a man, towards ſomewhat that is abſent, whether in reſpect of ſimple Being, or of Place only, and with all apprehended by the Deſirer, as connaturall and ſuteable unto him, either in reſpect of his own Perſonall conveniency and accommodation only, or the accommodation alſo of ſome others, whom he wiſheth well unto. How it differs from the other three, will plainly enough appeare in the Progreſſe. Secondly, to <hi>purpoſe,</hi> or <hi>intend</hi> (for between theſe I conceive there is very little difference, if any at all, in Point of ſignification) properly ſignifieth ſuch an act of the heart or ſoule, by which they reſolve or ingage themſelves to interpoſe and act towards the effecting or bringing to paſſe, of the thing <hi>purpoſed</hi> or <hi>intended</hi> (being alwayes ſuch a thing, which is apprehended good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for them) ſo far as they judge it meete, and agreeable to Principles of wiſdom, and good diſcretion. If there be any difference between them, it lieth (I conceive) rather in point of ſtrength or degree, then in nature and kinde; a <hi>purpoſe,</hi> being an <hi>intention, in ſieri</hi> (as the Schoolemens expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is) <hi>i. e.</hi> in the making; and an <hi>intention,</hi> a <hi>purpoſe in facto eſse,</hi> i. e. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly made. But they are taken promiſcuouſly the one for the other, and ſo may be, without any inconvenience, as far as yet I apprehend. For the fourth and laſt of the foure words mentioned, <hi>Decree;</hi> this properly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſuch an act of the heart or ſoule, by which men reſolve, determine, and conclude, to act to the uttermoſt of their ſtrength and might, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to paſſe, of the thing <hi>decreed,</hi> which is ſtill preſumed to be ſomewhat, that is of grand concernment unto them for good.</p>
            <p>Now though the difference between, <hi>deſires, purpoſes, intentions,</hi> and<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> 
               <hi>decrees,</hi> be diſcernable enough, by their reſpective deſcriptions that have been given, compared together; yet will it (I conceive) appeare to more ſatisfaction, by a dictinct aſſignement of their reſpective operations or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which they produce in men. For, if <hi>the Tree be knowne by the fruit,</hi> the difference of <hi>Trees,</hi> may <hi>be knowne</hi> by the difference of <hi>the fruits</hi> alſo. Firſt then, the ſimple <hi>deſire</hi> of a thing, and as ſuch, doth not ingage a man to act at all towards the effecting or procurement of it: a <hi>purpoſe</hi> or <hi>intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ingageth unto action in this kinde, but under Proviſo's, and with limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. A <hi>Decree</hi> (ſtrictly and properly ſo called) doth not ſimply ingage unto action, for the bringing to paſſe of the thing <hi>decreed,</hi> but ingageth home, without any Exception, Reſervation, or Proviſo, whatſoever, ſave only that of ſufficiency of Strength or Power, for matter of execution. A <hi>deſire,</hi> if it be intenſe, and raiſed to any height or ſtrength, and the nature
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94900:36"/> of the thing deſired be ſuch, that the procurement of it lieth, either in whole, or in part, within the Power of the Deſirer, and withall oppoſeth not (in his apprehenſion) either the Injoyment, or Procurement, of ſomewhat more deſireable unto him, alwayes advanceth into a <hi>purpoſe,</hi> or <hi>intention,</hi> of obtaining the thing ſo <hi>deſired.</hi> Otherwiſe, if it be either languiſhing, faint, and low, or the thing deſired be no wayes, in no kinde attainable by any thing the <hi>deſirer</hi> can do; or if his ingagement for the obtainment of it, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by him, as likely to prejudice him in any other matter of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in all theſe caſes the <hi>deſire</hi> ſubſiſts within it ſelf, and advanceth not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into <hi>intention</hi> nor action.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>deſire,</hi> when it is boild up to a conſiſtency, or fixed ſubſtance<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> of a Purpoſe, or Intention of obtaining the thing <hi>deſired,</hi> by means of this ſuper-added act, or further impreſſion upon the ſoul, being in conjunction with it, it ingageth the <hi>Deſirer,</hi> being now a <hi>Purpoſer</hi> and <hi>Intender</hi> likewiſe, to act, and give out himſelf in the uſe of meanes for the obtaining of the thing <hi>deſired</hi> and <hi>intended,</hi> as far, as he judgeth it meet, and well-ſtanding with the rules of wiſdom and diſcretion, for him to goe. Only this is to be remembred, that there is no man (at leaſt no conſidering man) that ſo far <hi>deſireth</hi> any thing, as to <hi>intend</hi> or <hi>purpoſe</hi> the obtaining of it, but that he ſo far ingageth himſelf in the uſe of meanes for the procurement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as he judgeth reaſonable and ſufficient for ſuch an attainment. If men do not advance ſuch a Proportion of means, which (in their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions at leaſt) is ſufficient to compaſſe what they <hi>purpoſe,</hi> or <hi>intend,</hi> it argues a vanity, or nullity rather, in their <hi>intentions.</hi> But on the other hand, there is no ground or reaſon to conclude from the non-aſſecution, or non-obtaining of a thing, yea though a man hath a ſufficiency of Power in ſome kinde to obtain it, that he did not really and unfeignedly Purpoſe and intend the effecting of it. A man takes a long journey to a perſon of quality, and in great place: the end and intent of his journey, is to obtaine a ſuite or courteſie at his hand. In his addreſſement to him, he demeans himſelf with all reſpects of honour and obſervance: uſeth many Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of great weight to perſwade and overcome him. The Perſon ſued unto ſtandeth off, and refuſeth to gratifie the Petitioner, unleſſe he will ſubmit to ſuch and ſuch terms, which are very inconvenient and diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him. The Petitioner being a man of Conſcience and Honour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the terms, and ſo returns ungratified in his motion. In this caſe, though he might with making a breach upon his Conſcience and Honour, have obtained that, which he ſued for, yet his non-obtaining it upon ſuch terms, doth no wayes argue, but that he really deſired it, yea and purpoſed and intended the obtaining of it, if it might have been procured upon meete and honourable terms. Many Caſes of like conſideration might be put.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, to <hi>Decree</hi> (in the ſtrict and formall ſignification of<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> the Word; for otherwiſe, <hi>Purpoſes,</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> ſometimes interchange ſignifications) importeth ſuch an act of the minde and will of a man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth not ſimply, or only <hi>Purpoſe</hi> or <hi>Intend</hi> the effecting of what he <hi>deſireth,</hi> but this upon ſuch terms, with ſuch ſtrength of <hi>intention</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that it carrieth him againſt, and above, all poſſible intervention of any diſſwaſive circumſtance whatſoever, one, or more, to the effecting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So that a <hi>Purpoſe</hi> or <hi>Intention,</hi> and a <hi>Decree,</hi> in ſtrictneſſe of notion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, may be diſtinguiſhed by their objects, thus: A <hi>Purpoſe,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94900:37"/> reſpecteth that which is deſireable, yet not ſimply and abſolutely deſireable, but upon ſuch and ſuch terms, under ſuch and ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: a <hi>Decree</hi> reſpecteth that which is ſimply and abſolutely deſireable, and from the Proſecution whereof a man ought not to be taken off by any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whatſoever. We ſpeak now of regular <hi>Purpoſes</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> and ſuch which are conceived and taken up by men according to Principles of ſound judgement and underſtanding.</p>
            <p>By the tenor and manuduction of theſe things, which are evident and<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> unqueſtionable, we may come readily, and ſteadily to conceive and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how, and in what ſence, <hi>Deſires, Purpoſes, Intentions,</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> are, and may be, aſcribed unto God. Firſt it is conſiderable, that <hi>Deſires,</hi> and <hi>Purpoſes</hi> or <hi>Intentions,</hi> are never ſeparated in God: he never <hi>deſireth</hi> any thing, but what he <hi>purpoſeth</hi> or <hi>intendeth</hi> to effect. The reaſon is, becauſe whatſoever he apprehendeth ſuteable to him, and of tendency to his glory, which is the adequate object of his <hi>Deſire,</hi> he alwayes intereſſeth himſelf to effect. Matters relating unto his glory, being the only object of his <hi>Deſires,</hi> unpoſſible it is that any of theſe ſhould be ſo weake, or faint, as not to advance and riſe up into a <hi>purpoſe</hi> and <hi>intention,</hi> and conſequently, into action; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially conſidering, 1. That there is nothing which concerns his glory, but which lieth within the compaſſe of his Power to effect, and 2. That by reaſon of his infinite wiſdom, being in conjunction with a Power every wayes commenſureable to it, he is able ſo to manage all the concernments of his glory, as not to prejudice himſelf in any, in, or by the Proſecution of others. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, though <hi>deſires,</hi> and <hi>purpoſes,</hi> or <hi>intentions,</hi> cannot be ſeparated in God, yet <hi>intentions</hi> or <hi>purpoſes,</hi> and <hi>decrees,</hi> may. God doth not alwayes <hi>decree</hi> the effecting, of what he <hi>purpoſeth,</hi> or <hi>intendeth</hi> to effect, though he alwayes <hi>purpoſeth</hi> and <hi>intendeth</hi> to effect, what he <hi>decreeth.</hi> The reaſon why he doth not alwayes <hi>decree</hi> to effect, what he <hi>purpoſeth</hi> or <hi>intendeth</hi> to effect, is; becauſe he judgeth it meet to act only to a certain degree of efficiency, for the effecting and obtaining of ſome things; by which if he cannot effect or obtain them, he judgeth it not meet to act any further, or higher, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto. But becauſe he never acteth for, or towards, the effecting of any thing, but with a due and full ſufficiency of means (the whole courſe and compaſſe of his efficiency in this kinde taken together) he may well and truly be ſaid to <hi>purpoſe</hi> and <hi>intend,</hi> whatſoever he ingageth himſelf to effect, though with the loweſt degree of efficiency, wherein at any time, and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to any end, he appeareth.</p>
            <p>If you aske me, but what are the things in Particular, or any of them,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> which God may be ſaid to <hi>Purpoſe</hi> or <hi>Intend,</hi> and yet not to <hi>Decree?</hi> I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In generall; they are all ſuch things, for the Procurement and effecting whereof he vouchſafeth means, and theſe ſufficient (for he never ſtarveth his ends for want of means, as hath been often, in effect, ſaid) and yet the things themſelves many times are not obtaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, nor ever come to paſſe: in which reſpect he cannot be ſaid to <hi>Decree</hi> them, becauſe his <hi>Decree</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Proper notion of the Word, formerly opened) carrieth all before it againſt, and above, all oppoſition and contradiction whatſoever, and never fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to <hi>bring forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. (In Particular) the Faith, and Repentance of all men, the honeſt and upright lives of all men, and conſequently the Peace, Happineſſe, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94900:37"/> ſalvation of all men, are ſome of the Principall of the Particulars inquired after. For, 1. Evident it is, that God interpoſeth and vouchſafeth means for the effecting and procurement of all theſe, (of which more hereafter) in which reſpect (according to the grounds laid) he muſt needs be ſaid to <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> or <hi>intend</hi> them. And yet 2. Every whit as evident it is, that theſe things are not effected or obtained, nor ever will: in which reſpect they cannot be ſaid to be <hi>Decreed</hi> by God, according to the Proper notion of a <hi>Decree,</hi> oft ſpecified.</p>
            <p>To draw up a full and cleer account from the Particulars argued, (with<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> as much brevity as may be) how, in what ſence, and upon what grounds, <hi>Deſires, Purpoſes, Intentions,</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> are attributed in Scripture unto God; Firſt (in the negative) that none of them are attributed unto him up on any ſuch ground or ſuppoſition as this, <hi>viz.</hi> as being Properly or Formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him, <hi>i. e.</hi> after ſuch a manner as they are in men; really diſtinct, and ſeparable from his Nature or Being, hath been already aſſerted, and that (I ſuppoſe) with <hi>a nemine contradicente.</hi> Therefore ſecondly, in direct purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Preparatory inſtructions formerly alſo delivered in order to the buſineſſe in hand, the ſaid four Particulars muſt be acknowledged, as attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto God upon this ground; <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the infinite Perfection of his Nature and Being, enableth, yea and leadeth him to act, and give out himſelf after ſome ſuch manner, and with ſuch a kinde of efficiency (rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable allowance being made for the great diſproportion between him, and the Creature) as the ſaid Particulars (<hi>Deſtres, Purpoſes, Intentions,</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi>) being found in men, are wont to ingage them unto. So that 1. God is ſaid to <hi>deſire,</hi> or will, ſuch and ſuch things, becauſe the goodneſſe of his Nature leadeth him, to act and give out himſelf, and to vouchſafe means, for the bringing of them to paſſe; it being an eſſentiall Property of <hi>deſire</hi> in men, 1. When it is cordiall and ſtrong (as all Gods Deſires are, as twas formerly Proved:) and 2. When men have opportunity to act for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the thing deſired (which God alwayes hath:) 3. And laſtly, when their acting for the obtaining of the thing deſired, is not like to hinder them from obtaining another thing more deſireable then that (a caſe never inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto God, in reſpect of any thing deſired by him, as hath alſo lately been ſhewed) it being (I ſay) in this caſe, and under theſe circumſtances, an eſſentiall Property of <hi>deſire</hi> in men, to ingage them unto action for the obtaining of the thing deſired. Becauſe whenſoever men act, or endeavour themſelves in any kinde to bring a thing to paſſe, they are alwayes preſum'd to <hi>deſire</hi> the thing, or the comming of it to paſſe; therefore God alſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture Dialect and Phraſe, may be ſaid to <hi>deſire,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he any wayes interpoſeth himſelfe, or giveth means, to bring to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is the ſame conſideration and ground alſo, of <hi>Purpoſes</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 17.</note> and <hi>Intentions</hi> attributed unto him. He is therefore ſaid to <hi>Purpoſe</hi> and <hi>Intend</hi> ſuch and ſuch things, becauſe his Goodneſſe, Wiſdom, and Power, <hi>i. e.</hi> The infinite Perfection of his Nature, which eminently containeth all theſe; enableth and induceth him to act for, or towards, the attainement of them, after ſuch a kinde of manner, and upon ſuch terms, according to which, men (I meane, ſober and well adviſed men) are wont to act and ingage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the aſſecution of ſuch things, which they <hi>Purpoſe</hi> and <hi>Intend.</hi> How, and upon what terms ſuch men are wont to act in order to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things Properly <hi>Purpoſed</hi> and <hi>Intended</hi> by them, and not abſolutely
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94900:38"/> 
               <hi>Decreed,</hi> was lately declared; <hi>viz.</hi> ſo far, and to ſuch a degree of ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they judge convenient and meet, conſideration being had, of the value, worth, and conſequence, of the things <hi>Purpoſed</hi> and <hi>Intended</hi> by them, in caſe they be obtained. Therefore to conclude Gods <hi>non-intendments</hi> from his non-attainments, is a reaſoning of no value; and ſuppoſeth a non-dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between his <hi>Purpoſes</hi> or <hi>Intentions,</hi> and <hi>Decrees;</hi> between which notwithſtanding (as hath been ſhewed) there is a very emphaticall and ſignall difference. The reaſon why God ingageth not himſelf to the actuall aſſecution of all things <hi>purpoſed</hi> and <hi>intended</hi> by him, ſhall (God willing) be argued in due Time and Place.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, God is alſo ſaid to <hi>Decree</hi> ſuch and ſuch things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> the infinite Perfection of his Nature and Being, inclineth him to act and ingage himſelf for the effecting of them, after ſuch a manner, and upon ſuch terms, as men are wont to ingage themſelves for the actuall Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and bringing to paſſe, of what they <hi>decree.</hi> What this manner, and what theſe terms are, we have already ſhewed. What men properly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or <hi>decree,</hi> they ingage to the uttermoſt of their might to put in execution and perform, if no lower rate of ingagement will do the deed. In like manner, God, is, and well may be, ſaid to <hi>Decree</hi> ſuch things, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and effecting whereof he ſuſpendeth upon no condition, or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whatſoever, one, or more: but declareth himſelf as one reſolved to give being unto them in their reſpective ſeaſons, whatſoever Angels, Men, Devils, or any other Creature, ſhall either doe, or not doe. In this ſence, and upon this ground, he may be ſaid to have <hi>decreed,</hi> that <hi>all men once ſhall die;</hi> that all men ſhall <hi>be raiſed from the dead;</hi> that men <hi>dying in the Lord,</hi> or in the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be everlaſtingly bleſſed; that men dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſins, or in unbeliefe, ſhall be eternally accurſed; to omit other Particulars without end of like conſideration. Only I deſire to re-minde the Reader of this: that though we have in our preſent diſcourſe exactly differen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced <hi>Purpoſes</hi> or <hi>Intentions,</hi> from <hi>Decrees,</hi> according to the ſtrict import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the words, and preciſe Notion of the things themſelves, yet may not this difference be alwayes ſo obſerved, either by other Writers, or by the Scriptures themſelves, but that the terms may be ſometimes put indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently the one for the other: yea and the things themſelves be expreſſed and held forth by ſuch Words and Phraſes of ſpeech, which will equally admit of either ſignification; yet as to the Scriptures, hardly (I preſume) can any inſtance be found, where either the context, or the ſubject matter in hand, will not cleerly determine the caſe; I meane, whether it be a <hi>Purpoſe,</hi> or a <hi>Decree,</hi> according to the regular Notion of either, (as they have been diſtinguiſhed) which the Holy Ghoſt there intends.</p>
            <p>Before we paſſe from the ſubject in hand, it will not be amiſſe (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> to take a more perfect knowledge, of what was intimated before; <hi>viz.</hi> That all the foure Particulars, <hi>Deſires, Purpoſes, Intentions,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> yea and more then theſe, in their reſpective attributions unto God, are frequently in Scripture expreſſed by THE WILL of God. <hi>Joh. 5. 21. Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to <hi>quicken whom he will,</hi> i. e. whom he <hi>deſireth,</hi> or <hi>intendeth,</hi> to <hi>quicken.</hi> See alſo. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 38. 17. 24. Whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Joh. 6. 39. And this is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> WILL <hi>that hath ſent me,</hi> &amp;c. and again, <hi>ver. 40. And this is the</hi> WILL <hi>of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Sonne, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life;</hi> evident it is, that the <hi>Decree,</hi> or <hi>decreeing</hi> WILL of God is meant. See alſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5. 9. 11. and elſewhere. The
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94900:38"/> Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking thus of God, <hi>who</hi> WILL <hi>have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 4. and <hi>Peter,</hi> that he is <hi>willing that all ſhould come to Repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9. ſpeak plainly not of Gods <hi>decreeing</hi> WILL, but of his <hi>purpoſing</hi> or <hi>deſiring.</hi> WILL? But of theſe Scriptures more hereafter.

            <p>For a cloſe to this Chapter, let us from the grounds Pre-aſſerted herein,<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> take into conſideration, the difference between the <hi>knowledge,</hi> or <hi>fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of God, and the <hi>Intentions,</hi> or <hi>Decrees</hi> of God. Therefore (not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate, but to build upon, Premiſed Principles and Diſcuſſions) Firſt, as the <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> of God are differenced by their objects, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his <hi>knowledge</hi> being far more large and comprehenſive, then the object of his <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> the one extending to all things whatſoever, Paſt, Preſent, and to Come, yea to all poſſibilities of things; the other, only to things that are future, and yet to come; ſo likewiſe both the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> of God taken together, are plainly diſtinguiſhed from his <hi>Intentions</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> by the greater latitude and extent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap>nd more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, then the object either of his <hi>Intentions,</hi> or <hi>Decrees.</hi> The object of his <hi>Decrees</hi> extendeth only to ſuch things, which (as was formerly argued) himſelf purpoſeth to effect, or give being unto, without any Exceptions or Proviſo's concerning any poſſible interventions whatſoever. The object of his <hi>Intentions</hi> or <hi>Purpoſes,</hi> extendeth to ſuch things only, which he deſireth and intendeth to give being alſo unto, but with condition and limitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that the utmoſt border and extent of the reſpective objects of the <hi>Purpoſes,</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> of God, reacheth but unto ſuch things only, about the Production and Procurement whereof himſelf intends Operativeneſſe and Poſitiveneſſe of action, or efficiency: whereas the limit of the object of his <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> extendeth unto all things whatſoever, that are future, and taketh in, as well ſuch things which his ſoul abhorreth, and therefore will not lift up his hand unto, I mean, the ſinfull actions of the Creature, as thoſe, which himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to call and bring into being.</p>
            <p>If you demand a reaſon, why I make this difference between the object of<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> of God on the one hand, and the object of his <hi>Intentions</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> on the other, extending the one to all things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without exception; reſtraining the other, to ſuch future things only, wherein God himſelf means to be active; my Reaſon and Anſwer is this (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to fore-laid grounds;) men generally do <hi>know,</hi> and commonly <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know,</hi> many things, for, or towards the Production or procurement where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they intend no contribution of aid, ſtrength, or means in any kind, <hi>viz.</hi> when they are ſuch, that their comming to paſſe, and their not comming to paſſe, are but of equall and indifferent concernment to them, as knowing how to make the ſame benefit or uſe, of the one, and of the other. Whereas ſome other things there are, the effecting whereof, or at leaſt the attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and endevouring whereof, is of ſpeciall concernment unto them. Now things of this latter conſideration, are the object of mens <hi>Deſires, Intentions</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> and they purpoſe to be active about the bringing of them to paſſe, whereas matters of the former, are the object of their <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> only; and (haply) of their Providence, if as well their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94900:39"/> coming to paſſe, as their not comming to paſſe, be contriveable by them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any matter of benefit, or advantage. In like manner, the ſins, and wicked wayes and actions of men, may be called the object of the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>fore-Knowledge,</hi> yea and of the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, as well as his own moſt juſt and holy diſpenſations, becauſe through the infinite Perfection of his Nature and Being, he is inabled, 1. To declare, or Pre-declare as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; and 2. Both inabled and actually reſolved, to diſpoſe, and Pre-diſpoſe, of them to the beſt advantage for his own glory, as well as if he formally <hi>knew,</hi> or <hi>fore-knew</hi> them: whereas notwithſtanding he neither was, nor is, nor ever intendeth to be, operative, in, or about the bringing of them to paſſe, in as much as their non comming to paſſe would have been of the ſame conſequence unto him for the advancement of his glory, as their coming to paſſe, is, or can be. For (doubtleſſe) God is not ſo poorely or meanely provided, in, and of himſelf, for the exaltation of his Name and Glory, as to ſtand in need of the dunghill of ſin to make a foot-ſtoole for him whereby to aſcend into his Throne. If the <hi>goodneſse</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſse</hi> of men be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto God, <hi>profit</hi> not him <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 16. 2. Job. 35. 7. 3.</note>, much leſſe can the ſins of men claime <hi>part and fellowſhip</hi> in ſuch a buſineſſe. So then the ſins of men, being only <hi>known</hi> and <hi>fore-knowne</hi> by God, and contriveable to his glory, but no wayes requiſite or neceſſary hereunto; may well be look'd upon as the object (I meane, the partiall object) of the <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> yea and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, but not of his <hi>Deſires, Intentions,</hi> or <hi>Decrees.</hi> Whereas his own diſpenſations, with their Naturall and Proper fruits and conſequents being intrinſecally, and with a direct tendency, of ſovereigne and high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for his glory, may ſafely, and with the beſt conſiſtency of reaſon and truth, be looked upon, as the object, not of his <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> only, but of his <hi>Deſires, Intentions</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> alſo.</p>

               <hi>only True God?</hi> Firſt, to <hi>know God,</hi> or the Father, <hi>the only True God,</hi> may admit of a double conſtruction, or meaning: either, 1.

To <hi>know [viz.</hi> upon ſubſtantiall and demonſtrative grounds] that his Nature or Being every wayes anſwers the true and regular Notion of a God, <hi>i. e.</hi> That he is infinitely Gracious, infinitely Wiſe, infinitely Juſt, infinitely Powerfull, infinitely Bleſſed, infinite in all manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Perfection; and all this in the moſt abſolute ſimplicity of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, without any Plurality, Multiplication, or Compoſition in what kinde, or of what things, ſoever: and on the other hand, that there is nothing in him, in one kinde or other, in one conſideration, or other, which reaſon duly inform'd, and judging like it ſelf, can think unmeete or unworthy to be found in a <hi>true God.</hi> This is to <hi>know</hi> God, or God the Father, to be a <hi>True God.</hi> 2.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94900:40"/> to be really conferr'd upon them, upon their believing, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therein unto the end: though it is true, that men generally as they grow up in the World, convert theſe Principles <hi>of light</hi> and underſtanding to other uſes, and not to thoſe, for which they are given them; as <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>make proviſion for the fleſh for the fulfilling of the luſts thereof,</hi> and not to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of <hi>that life</hi> and happineſſe, which is <hi>in Christ</hi> for them; as fooliſh Children, which fall to play, or quarrell amongſt themſelves, by the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of that Candle, which their Parents allow them for their ſtudies and books. Yea men generally doe not only miſ-ſpend thoſe Talents of light we ſpeake of, about the impertinencies of this preſent World, but partly through an un-manlike oſcitancy and inconſiderateneſſe, partly out of an inordinate Propenſity to comport with the World without any feare or ſence of danger hereby, ſuffer their judgements and underſtandings to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, adulterated, imbaſed and abuſed by many falſe and fooliſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Notions, which turne them quite aſide from a regular and due proſecution of that Life and Salvation, which is <hi>in Chriſt</hi> for them, and might have been obtained by them; yea and ſubject them to a ſad incapacity of the things of their Peace, when they are propoſed with the greateſt Evidence and Power unto them. Inſomuch that though <hi>the Life,</hi> which was <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>the light of men;</hi> yet it immediately followeth, that <hi>the light ſhineth in darkneſſe, [i. e.</hi> The Doctrine of Life and Salvation is cleerly Preached to an ignorant World] <hi>and the darkneſse comprehended it not. [i. e.</hi> That ignorance, or incapacity rather, of the things of eternall life, which men have voluntarily contracted and brought upon themſelves, is fo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and ſtrange, that they underſtand little or nothing of this Doctrine ſo Preached unto them.] But this occaſionally only, and by the way. As to the Worke in hand; doubtleſſe there was never any man touch'd with any competent ſence, or enlightened with any tolerable Notion of a Deity, that ever put it to the queſtion in himſelf, whether God was <hi>perfect,</hi> or no. <hi>All men</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Metaphyſiques) without</hi> any demur or <hi>delay, aſcribe that unto God, which they conceive to be most perfect.</hi> And indeed, that very Sence and Notion of God, which Nature prompteth her Children with (though many of them are <hi>dull of hearing</hi> in this kind) doth not admit of any thing look'd upon as defective, or imperfect, within the Verge of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore having ſo firme, and ſo generally-approved a foundation to build upon, as the <hi>perfection</hi> of God, let us ſee what it affordeth unto us by way of<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> evident deduction, toward the advancement of our great deſign, the <hi>magnifying of God in his gracious intendments of ſalvation unto all men, without exception, in, or by the Death of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, if the Nature, Eſſence, and Being of God be moſt <hi>perfect,</hi> then muſt it needs be moſt ſimple, moſt intirely, abſolutely, and perfectly one, not admitting any Plurality, or Compoſition whatſoever. The reaſon of this is plaine: becauſe all Plurality and Compoſition, whether of Parts, or of Natures, ſuppoſe imperfection. For if any one of theſe Parts, or Natures, were <hi>perfect,</hi> abſolutely or infinitely <hi>perfect,</hi> it were able to do whatſoever is neceſſary, yea or poſſible to be done (for without this there is no ſimple or abſolute <hi>perfection</hi>) and then what need were there of any thing more to be added unto it, or joyn'd with it? That a man hath Eares, as well as Eyes, and Eyes, as well as Eares: and ſo, Hands, as well as Feet, and Feet, as well as Hands, cleerly proves, that no one of theſe members are ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely <hi>perfect, i. e.</hi> can do or performe, and this with a like comelineſſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94900:40"/> and conveniency, whatſoever is neceſſary to be done and performed by man: for then all the reſt ſhould be ſuperfluous. They may all be <hi>perfect</hi> in their kinde, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a determinate and limited <hi>perfection,</hi> and in order to ſuch, or ſuch, a particular action and ſervice, and yet one <hi>ſtand in neede of another</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh:) but if any one of them were ſimply and abſolutely <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, i. e.</hi> could doe all things whatſoever, upon the ſame terms of convenience, which both it ſelf, and all the reſt can do together, certainly all the reſt were needleſſe. So if an Angel could underſtand by his meere Eſſence or Subſtance of his Nature, without any endowment or gift of underſtanding diſtinct there-from; or could perform any other action, or do any execution imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by his Eſſence, without the intervening of thoſe Naturall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or qualities of Strength, Power, Activeneſſe, &amp;c. all theſe endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and appendices to his Nature and Eſſence, would be meerly ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The neceſſity which the Angels have of Wiſdom, Knowledge, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Strength, &amp;c. over and beſides their meere Eſſences and Beings, plainly declareth and ſheweth, theſe Eſſences and Beings of theirs to be unperfect (I meane, in reſpect of a ſimple and abſolute perfection) and that they ſtand in neede of ſuch additionall Properties and Endowments, as we ſpeak of, to make them <hi>perfect</hi> even in their own kind. Nor is it indeed poſſible for God to make any ſuch Creature (or to ſpeak ſomewhat more properly, no ſuch Creature can poſſibly be made) which ſhall be able to act or worke imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by its Eſſence, or otherwiſe then by the mediation of ſome Vertue, Property, or Quality, in one kinde or other, inherent therein; it being the glorious and incommunicable property and prerogative of the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Being it ſelf, ſo to worke. So then this abſolute and infinite ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Nature of God ſuppoſed, as without which he cannot be abſolutely and infinitely <hi>perfect,</hi> it plainly followeth,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that all thoſe attributes of God (commonly ſo called) as Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> Knowledge, Juſtice, Mercy, Goodneſſe, Power, &amp;c. and ſo all thoſe Paſſions and Affections, as of Anger, Griefe, Repentance, Love, Hatred, &amp;c.<note place="margin">

But therefore all this variety and diverſity, both of Attributes, Affections, and Parts, is attributed unto him, becauſe by meanes of this one ſimple and ſingle Eſsence, being infinitely <hi>perfect,</hi> he can, when he pleaſeth, and pleaſeth, when he judgeth meet, give forth himſelf, and act all that variety and diverſity of action, which theſe different Principles are wont to produce in men. As for example; a man that hath wiſdom, is able to act, and doth act when he pleaſeth, in a regular proportion, or due order unto his ends. So a man that hath knowledge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of things paſt, preſent, or to come, being wiſe withall, manageth and diſpoſeth his affaires according to the exigency of ſuch knowledge, and with the beſt advantage, that ſuch knowledge affords unto him. A man that is juſt, doth things that are juſt and equall: and ſo he that is angry, frowns, threatens, or ſtrikes: he that loves, doth good unto, and kindly by thoſe, who are loved of him: he that hates, acts to the prejudice or hurt of the perſon hated, when he hath opportunity; and ſo in the reſt. Now becauſe God out of the infinite perfection of his Nature, though it be (as hath been ſaid) moſt ſingly and ſimply one, is yet able to act, and doth act, when he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94900:41"/> pleaſeth, all this variety of action, acts as wiſe men act, as men that have knowledge of things act, as men that are angry, as men that love, as men that hate, are wont to act, &amp;c. Therefore all theſe Principles of action, as Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Knowledge, Anger, Love, Hatred, &amp;c. are by the Holy Ghoſt aſcribed unto him. Suppoſe there were in Phyſique ſuch a ſimple, as (for example) an Herb, Root, Drug, Mineral, or the like, which had ſuch a precious or ſoveraigne vertue in it, that the uſe of it were a certaine cure of all diſeaſes, as Gout, Stone, Feaver, Apoplexy, &amp;c. and further, that there were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Medicines or Receipts beſides appropriated to every diſeaſe reſpectively, and were all of them ſufficient to cure their appropriated diſeaſes; in this caſe, that ſimple we ſpeak of, might be ſaid to have the ſeverall vertues of all thoſe other Medicines or Receipts, in it, becauſe it is able to do alone, as much, and as many things (in a medicinall way) as all thoſe taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet can it not be ſaid to have the vertue of any one of them in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall or formall Nature of it, but only eminently, <hi>i. e.</hi> in reſpect of that ſoveraigne Property, which, though it be ſimply and formally but one, yet anſwereth in value, worth, and variety of operation, unto all the ſeverall vertues, and healing properties in all thoſe other Receipts. In like manner all that great variety of Faculties, Powers, Properties, Vertues, Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Excellencies, and all Principles of action whatſoever, that are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in their proper and diſtinct Natures amongſt the Creatures, may be attributed unto God, though not ſo much as any one of them be properly and formally in him; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe there is that ſoveraign and ſuper tranſcendent perfection in his Nature, being but ſimply, and moſt ſingly one, which for Power and variety of action in every kind, anſwereth them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea and far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth them alſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the ſimplicity of the Nature of God, as it hath been ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> and explained, it cleerly followeth, that love and hatred, and ſo mercy and juſtice, or ſeverity, in God, towards his Creature, do not argue any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent affection, or inclination in him towards it (the ſimplicity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not admitting of any ſuch difference) but only a different diſpenſation (anſwerable to the different effects, or expreſſions, of ſuch Principles in men.) So that there is no inconvenience nor untruth in it at all, to affirme that God at one and the ſame time, may both hate and love, and ſo again, love and hate, the ſame Perſon; <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of ſeverall diſpenſations of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Nature and import. As for example; when he ſeverely puniſheth a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſon, for ſome ſin, or ſins, committed, and yet withall continues ſuch a meaſure of his Grace or good Spirit unto him, whereby he is inabled ſtill to believe in God, and to love him, his fore affliction notwithſtanding; in reſpect of this latter diſpenſation, God may be ſaid to love; and in reſpect of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to hate him.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded; but can God in any ſence be ſaid to hate a Perſon that is godly? I anſwer, that hatred in God, importing, not matter of affection, but of diſpenſation only agreeable to the effects of <hi>hatred</hi> in men; to deny that God can in any ſence be ſaid to hate a godly Perſon, is to deny that he can puniſh him for ſin, or act to the prejudice of his Comfort and Peace in any kinde, howſoever he provoketh him.</p>
            <p>If it be yet ſaid; but the Scripture will not juſtifie or warrant any ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion as this, that God ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth a godly Perſon. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By conceſſion, that the Scripture doth not indeed (to my beſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) juſtifie or warrant ſuch a ſaying, by way of example, or ſameneſſe of expreſſion. But</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:94900:41"/>2. (By way of exception) I anſwer, that the Scripture warranteth many things by way of reaſon or ground, which it doth not warrant, either by Example, Precept, or otherwiſe then by ground, as is famouſly known in the caſe of Infant-Baptiſme, and of womens admiſſion to the Lords Table. Now where ever, either the Perfection or Simplicity of God is aſſerted in the Scriptures, whether expreſly, or by way of conſequence (as both the one and the other frequently are) there is a ſufficient ground laid, to warrant, both truth, and alſo aptneſſe enough of expreſſion in ſuch a ſaying as this, that God may be ſaid both to Love, and to hate the ſame Perſon, yea, and both theſe at one and the ſame time (as hath been ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, from the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the Nature of God, the Truth<note place="margin">§ 7.</note> of that common maxime in Divinity, <hi>Quicquid eſt in Deo, Deus eſt,</hi> i. e. <hi>whatſoever is in God, is God,</hi> is fully demonſtrable: and conſequently that neither from eternity was there any thing, neither for the preſent is there any thing, nor ever ſhall be any thing in him to eternity, inferior to himſelf, any thing which is not God. And if ſo, then both the juſtification of men from eternity, and ſo the condemnation of men from eternity, are but idle fancies, with which ſome men, partly through weakneſſe, partly through inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateneſſe, commit ſpirituall fornication. Yea, though I will not ſay that any of the Perſons, who hold either of theſe opinions, doe blaſpheme; yet the opinions themſelves narrowly examined, will not be found innocent from this great offence: in as much as both the one and the other, do apparantly give the honour of the glorious God in his incommuicable attribute of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>a parte ante</hi> (as Divines call it) to weake and contemptible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, men: they make theſe co-eternall with God, and to ſubſiſt from Eternity. For that which is not, can neither be juſtified, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded (in favour of theſe opinions) but had not men ſome<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> kinde of being, or ſubſiſtence, from eternity? were they not in the Mind of God, and preſent with him, after ſome ſuch manner, as the <hi>Idea,</hi> or modell of an houſe is in the mind of the Architect, before there be ſo much as a ſtone of it laid?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer (according to the tenor of what hath been lately argued and proved concerning the ſimplicity of the Divine Eſſence) that if they had any being from eternity, it could be none other then the Divine Being it ſelf: for there were no plurality of beings from eternity. All beings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginnings, may be numbred by the figure of one, and this unmultiplied. Therefore if God juſtified any from eternity, it muſt be himſelf: if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or reprobated any from eternity, it muſt be himſelf likewiſe. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> can men be ſaid to have been in the mind of God from eternity, after any ſuch manner, as the <hi>Idea</hi> or Platforme of an houſe is in the mind of the Artificer, before he begins to build: becauſe ſuch an <hi>Idea</hi> is no part of the Artificer, nor yet of his mind, but is cleerly ſeparable from both; whereas there was nothing in God from eternity but his own Eſſence, and that which is altogether inſeparable from him. Or if it ſhould be granted, that men were in God, or in the mind of God, from eternity, after ſuch a manner as is contended for; yet could it not be ſaid that men, men themſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe Creatures, which conſiſt of bodies and ſouls, and have ſinned on Earth, were either juſtified or condemned from eternity, but only their <hi>Idea's</hi> or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations in the mind of God. Yet how, or in what Sence, or Notion,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94900:42"/> theſe ſhould be ſaid, to be either juſtified, or condemned, when as they never ſinned, nor are capable of ſinning, is out of the reach of my underſtanding to conceive.</p>
            <p>If it be yet further demanded, but were not men (and all things beſides)<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> in ſome conſideration, or ſence, in God, from eternity; and may it not be ſaid, that in this ſence, whatever it be, they were ſome juſtified, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. (By conceſſion) that men, and all things beſides, were in God from eternity <hi>tanquam in fonte, ſeu radice, vel cauſâ productivâ,</hi> i. e. as in the fountaine, roote, or Productive cauſe of their reſpective beings. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing capable of receiving an exiſtence, or actuall being, but what had a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall or ſeminall Being in ſome Productive cauſe or other, one, or more, before. Therefore if this Univerſe, with all the Parts and Members of it, had not been in God, as in the Productive Cauſe, doubtleſſe they had never been produced, or received being. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. I anſwer further (by way of exception) that men, conſidered in that being, which they had in God from eternity, were no wayes capable, either of juſtification, or of condemnation, or of any ſuch difference or diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between them, as theſe two acts, or conditions, infer. For as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the common roote, or producent cauſe of all men, was one, ſingly, ſimply, and moſt undividedly one, from eternity, ſo were all men ſingly, and ſimply one in him; all alike holy, all alike innocent, and free from ſin: and conſequently all alike beloved of him, all being yet nothing but himſelf. It cannot be ſaid of the Roſes, which in the winter time were vertually and ſeminally in one and the ſame roote, that ſome of them flouriſhed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered, others, were blaſted or eaten up with Wormes, whileſt they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the roote; though afterwards, when they come to receive actuall Production, and to ſubſiſt <hi>extra cauſas,</hi> reſpectively, this difference may very poſſibly befall them.</p>
            <p>Yea, but were not ſome men juſtified, and others condemned, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> Purpoſe, and Decree of God, from eternity? I anſwer;</p>
            <p>(If the meaning of the Queſtion be only this, whether God from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity did not Purpoſe, or Decree, to juſtifie ſome men, and condemne others) that God from eternity did Purpoſe and Decree, to juſtifie in time all thoſe, who ſhould in time believe; and to condemne all thoſe, who living to years of diſcretion, ſhould die in their unbeliefe: yet theſe Decrees, though in their reſpective executions they make a great difference indeed between Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Perſons, yet in their making or enacting by God, they made none at all. This Decree of <hi>God, whoſoever believeth, ſhall be juſtified,</hi> doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make, nor ſuppoſe, any one man, any whit neerer, either to believing, or to juſtification, then another: nor on the other hand doth this Decree, <hi>He that believes not, ſhall be condemned,</hi> either make, or ſuppoſe, one man neerer, either to unbeliefe, or condemnation through unbeliefe, then another. A Law that is made for the puniſhing of Murder, or Adultery, with death, relates no more, in the intention of the Law-makers, at the time of the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or enacting of it, to one man, then to another. <hi>i. e.</hi> they intended no more the puniſhment, or death, of one man, then of another, (perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered;) much leſſe did they intend to make any man, or to permit any man to become, a Murtherer, or Adulterer, by the enacting of ſuch a Law, but the contrary: yet this Law, when it comes to be put in execution for the crimes made puniſhable by it, and voluntarily committed by men, makes as great
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94900:42"/> a difference between men, and men (and ſomewhat greater) as is between the living, and the dead.</p>
            <p>If the meaning of the Queſtion laſt propounded be, whether <hi>God</hi> did not<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> from eternity Decree the juſtification of ſuch and ſuch particular men by Name; and ſo the condemnation of others, after the ſame manner; I anſwer, that (doubtleſſe) he did from eternity Decree, equivalently, though not formally, the juſtification of all thoſe particular Perſons by Name, who in time come to be juſtified; and ſo again, the condemnation of all thoſe by Name, who in time come to be condemned. My meaning is, that no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſon, whatſoever his Name be, who comes to be juſtified, but his juſtification flowes from that Decree of <hi>God</hi> from eternity, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to juſtifie all thoſe by their Names, who ſhould believe. For had not <hi>God</hi> made ſuch a Decree as this (and make it he muſt from eternity, if he made it at all) certainly no man could ever be juſtified upon ſuch terms. In like manner <hi>God</hi> from eternity Decreed the condemnation of all ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, whatever their Names be, who living to maturity of years, ſhould die in unbeliefe. In this ſence and conſideration, and in this only (as far as yet I apprehend) <hi>God</hi> may be ſaid to have Decreed, both the juſtification, and the condemnation of particular men, and women, from eternity. <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he made two ſuch Decrees from eternity, by the one of which, all particular Perſons come to be juſtified, who ever are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and by the other, all particular Perſons to be condemned, who are condemned. But we ſhall have opportunity to argue the unſoundneſſe of both the opinions, eſpecially of the latter, upon other grounds: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference whereunto we ſuperſede any further inquiry into them for the preſent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if <hi>God</hi> in his Nature, or Eſſence, be ſimply, abſolutely, and<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> infinitely <hi>perfect,</hi> then muſt he needs be a moſt pure and ſimple act, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any potentiality at all: <hi>i. e.</hi> he muſt needs be actually, <hi>Et de praeſenti</hi> (as they ſay) and ſo have been from eternity, whatſoever he is capable of being, or whatſoever it is poſſible for him ever to be. The reaſon of this, is, becauſe all potentiality, or poſſibility of being any thing more, or any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, what a Perſon, or thing, is, for the preſent, argueth imperfection: which is cleerly proved thus. Whatſoever it is poſſible for a Perſon (or thing) to be, which at preſent he is not, muſt needs be ſomething, which will either add unto his being, and make it better: or elſe take away from his being, and ſo make it worſe: or elſe be a thing meerly indifferent, and ſo of no concernment unto him at all. So then, if a man be capable of being any thing, which yet he is not, for the bettering of his condition, it is a cleere caſe that his preſent condition, or being, is <hi>unperfect:</hi> for he is as yet deſtitute of that, which ſhould add <hi>perfection</hi> unto him. If he be capable of any thing, or of being any thing, which yet he is not, to the making of his preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition worſe, here the caſe is yet more cleere, that ſuch a mans condition is not <hi>perfect.</hi> For to be obnoxious to the deprivation or loſing of any good, which a man injoyeth for the preſent, manifeſtly argueth weakneſſe and <hi>imperfection.</hi> Thirdly and laſtly, if a man be capable of being any thing, which yet he is not, ſuppoſe it be without any relation at all to his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either for the better, or the worſe, yet this alſo plainely argueth <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection.</hi> For it ſuppoſeth, that a man hath ſomething, hath a capacity, which is a meere ſuperfluity to him, and doth him no good, yea which he knoweth not how to improve for his good; and this as apparantly as either
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94900:43"/> of the former, argueth <hi>imperfection.</hi> So that certaine it is, that if the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Being of God be abſolutely, and infinitely <hi>perfect,</hi> he muſt needs be a pure and meer act, all in preſent and actuall Being, whatſoever it is poſſible for him ever to be.</p>
            <p>This moſt intire and compleat Actuality of the Divine Nature and Being,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> is (I preſume) generally ſubſcribed by all Reformed Divines. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Zanchie) is a moſt pure, and moſt ſimple act, and no wayes capable, or in any poſsibility, of being any thing, more or leſſe, then what he is</hi>

Upon the account of this Authors credit, who intereſſeth <hi>all the godly</hi> in the Aſſertion and Belief of Gods unchangeableneſſe, (and conſequently, of that perfect actuality, which we aſſert) I judge it needeleſſe to make any further levy of Teſtimonies in this behalf.</p>
            <p>Only (I conceive) it may be worthy our paines to vindicate this Doctrine<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> of this Actuality of God, from the incumbrance of an Objection, or two. Firſt, if God be ſo Pure, Meere, and Perfect an Act, that no mutation in any kinde is incident unto Him, how can He be ſaid to act, or do any thing to day, which He did not yeſterday, or before, yea from eternity? as for example, to give Faith unto a Perſon, or make him a Believer to day, who was an Unbeliever yeſterday? Or doth God worke no more, no otherwiſe, in, or upon a man, when he is made an actuall Believer, then he did, whileſt he was yet an Unbeliever? And if God changeth his action, or manner of action, or acteth at all, where he acted not before, is he not ſomewayes mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and conſequently, no ſuch Pure, or Compleat Act, as hath been aſſerted.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. What Mutations, Changes, or Differences ſoever be at any time found in Men, or in other Creatures, whether in their Natures, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Motions, Actions, or in what reſpect ſoever, moſt certaine it is that God is uniformly and unchangeably the ſame in His, both Nature, [or Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence] Properties, and Actings. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>) defers <hi>his aſsiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, as ſeemeth good unto Him, and moves the hearts of Men at a certaine time, whereas He moved them not before: which notwithstanding we queſtion not but He doth without any change of Himſelf</hi>

The Eſſence or Being of God being altogether unchangeable, and His Operations or Actings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really and formally the ſame with His Eſſence, unpoſſible it is that the one ſhould be more changeable, then the other. Therefore,</p>
            <p>2. When a man believeth to day, who believed not yeſterday, or before,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> though God now inclines and moveth His heart to believe, which he did
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94900:43"/> not before, yet he doth it not by any new act, or exertion of himſelf, but by that firſt great eternall act of His, <hi>quo totum Ens, &amp; omnes ejus differentias profudit</hi> (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>i. e.</hi> by which he poured out (as it were) from himſelf at once, the whole and intire body of entity or being, with all, and all manner the differences of it. For we are not to conceive, that upon the multiplication or new production of Entities or Beings, the acts of God are multiplied, for, or in, their production; but that whatſoever is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by him, or receives being from him (as all things that have being, do) when, or at what time ſoever they receive this being, they receive it by vertue of that one creative act of his, by which at once (<hi>in the beginning,</hi> as the Scripture phraſe is) he gave being to all things, Paſt, Preſent, and yet to Come. Nor are we to conceive, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> reporteth the Hiſtory of the Creation, thus; <hi>And God ſaid let there be light</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note>: and afterwards (<hi>viz.</hi> after a dayes ſpace) that he ſaid, <hi>Let there be a Firmament</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 1. 6.</note>: and again, (after the ſame diſtance of time) <hi>Let the waters under the Heaven he gathered together into one place,</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he ſpake theſe things at three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall diſtinct times, or that he waited the juſt ſpace of a day between ſpeech, and ſpeech; but that <hi>Moſes</hi> his intent in this deſcription, or relation, was, to declare, by what ſucceſſive ſpaces or diſtances of time, that one Creative Word of <hi>God</hi> which he ſpake at once, took place, and gave being to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall, and reſpective parts of the Univerſe. So that (for example) when, by way of Preface to the ſecond dayes worke, he writeth thus: <hi>And God ſaid, let there be a Firmament, &amp;c.</hi> His meaning only was to ſignifie, what that one creative Word of <hi>God,</hi> once, and at once, ſpoken, did produce, or give being unto, towards the compleating of the Univerſe, the ſecond day after the Creation was begun; not that <hi>God</hi> reſted, or kept ſilence, for a dayes ſpace, and then fell to work again.</p>
            <p>This truth, I mean, that all temporary and ſucceſſive effects in the World,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> whether produced by the intervening and concourſe of ſecond Cauſes, or without, are produced by the impreſſion and vigour of that one great act of God we ſpeak of and not by any new act, exerciſed or exerted by him in order to their ſeverall and particular Productions, is frequently inſinuated in the Scriptures themſelves; yea, and is demonſtrable by ground of reaſon; and nothing but what hath been the judgement of ſeverall learned men, and of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (by name). The context of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Gen. 2. 4. tenoureth thus: <hi>Theſe are the generations of the Heavens, and of the Earth, when they were created;</hi> IN THE DAY, <hi>that the Lord made the Earth and the Heavens, and every plant of the field,</hi> BEFORE IT WAS IN THE EARTH, <hi>and every herb of the Field,</hi> BEFORE IT GREVV.

            <p>By the way, leſt the Table of this Doctrine ſhould prove a ſnare of error<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> or miſtake unto any, foure things are diligently to be minded. Firſt, that that one great Act of God, by which he gave Being, in time, unto the World, and unto all things, that either have been, or ever ſhall be produced, or done, in it, was not exerciſed, or acted by him in time, but from, or in, eternity. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe being really and formally one, and the ſame thing with his Eſſence and Being, (as learned men generally acknowledge) it could not be of any later, or other, edition, then ſo. Secondly, that this act, though acted or put forth by him from eternity, is not therefore to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as an act that is paſt, or finiſhed long ſince, but as permanent, and continued in him, or by him (yet without any ſucceſſion, or continuity of time) according to that of our Saviour, <hi>My Father</hi> WORKETH HI<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>THERTO, <hi>and I worke</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 5. 17.</note>. There is nothing periſhable, or changeable in God: what he worketh once, he worketh alwayes; though the Products or Effects of his working, alter and change, riſe and fall. The late learned Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> aſſerteth <hi>theſe Propoſitions as true, in the opinion of all Divines: 1. That God can Will nothing in time:</hi> [if ſo, then that Will of His, by which the World was at firſt Created, and by which all things are in continuance and ſucceſſion of time produced, muſt needs be from, or in, eternity.] 2. <hi>That God cannot but have that Will which he hath:</hi> [if ſo, then that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94900:44"/> will, by which he created the World, and gave being unto all things that were to receive being in time, is unchangeably permanent in him. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 3. And laſtly, <hi>that God cannot have any will, which for the preſent he hath not</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Deus poteſt nihil velle ex tempore; Deus non poteſt non habere volitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, quam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet. Non poteſt habere volitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem quam non habet. Davenant.</hi> Animadverſions upon a Treatiſe, intituled, Gods love to man-kind.

            <p>A third thing to be conſidered for a right underſtanding of the point in<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> hand, is; that that Act of God we ſpeake of, though from eternity, and the effects or productions of it in time, yet is it not to be conceived as prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous in time, to theſe effects, or productions themſelves. Though God (for example) willed that will from eternity, which was efficacious to make <hi>Peter</hi> a Believer in time, yet is not the act of this Will in <hi>God</hi> to be looked upon, or conceived, as preceding in time that act of <hi>Peters</hi> will, by which he became, or was made, a Believer. The reaſon hereof, is, becauſe there is no ſucceſſion, nothing ſooner, nothing later, nothing before, nothing after other in order of time, in eternity; nor yet in thoſe things, which are meaſured by eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as by their proper and adequate meaſure, as all the Acts of <hi>God</hi> are.

Nothing can be inſtrumentall, in, or about the producing of an action, or effect, but only in a way of, and according to, ſuch an efficiency, which is proper to the nature of it. Charms and Spells written in Paper, and hung about the neck, are not inſtrumentall in the Cures which are wrought by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, there being no Property, or Quality in them, which holds any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cauſality with ſuch effects, as the Cures of Diſeaſes are: nor can ſuch Cures be truly ſaid to be wrought by them, though (haply) they would not be wrought without them. In like manner the nature and property of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, Exhortations, Chaſtiſements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being to perſwade, or worke the hearts of men to a change, contingently only, and not in a way of neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much leſſe of compulſion, unpoſſible it is that theſe ſhould be <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall</hi> in the Hand of God, in <hi>changing the hearts of men,</hi> unleſſe it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that this change is wrought by him contingently, and with a poſſibility at any time, before it be effected, that it ſhould not be effected; and this not only in reſpect of his liberty, whether he will go through with the worke, and effect it, or no, but in reſpect of the liberty of the will it ſelf, whether it will be perſwaded to a change, or no.

The Nature of the will is to work, I mean, to aſſent, and diſſent, freely, contingently, and without any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, either from within, or from without. Therefore if God <hi>worketh nothing contrary to the Nature</hi> of the will, the will ſtill conſents unto him upon ſuch terms, that ſhe is at liberty to diſſent, any thing that he worketh to procure this conſent notwithſtanding.

He that ſaith, <hi>the will moved by God, is able not only to reſiſt, but alſo to obey God in his Motion,</hi> doubtleſſe meaneth, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that the <hi>will is able to reſist</hi> him, in, or under thoſe very <hi>Motions,</hi> under which, and by meanes whereof, ſhe is able alſo to <hi>conſent unto</hi> him, and <hi>obey</hi> him. Beſides, ſaying that <hi>the will receives</hi> POVVER <hi>of aſsenting and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the grace of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> doth he not plainly imply, that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from hence no neceſſitating impreſſions unto theſe actions? A man that is unavoidably carried, or acted, in, or towards an action, can in no tolerable conſtruction, be ſaid to <hi>receive Power</hi> for the performance of this action; in as much as the conferring of a <hi>Power</hi> to do that which a man was not able to do before, doth no wayes infer the taking away of that Power (ſuch as it was) which this man had before, not to act. Notwithſtanding my ſence and judgement in the point is, that the <hi>will receives from the grace of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> not only <hi>a Power of conſenting, and obeying</hi> God in his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious movings, but (<hi>Senſu ſano</hi>) theſe actings themſelves. But of this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. It is (I ſuppoſe) needleſſe, (and would be more tedious, then dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult) to make the Pile of Teſtimonies from our beſt and moſt approved Authors, for the confirmation of the Truth laſt aſſerted, any whit greater.

But for the Truth of this Aſſertion (hitherto managed, and credited by the authority of men) that no Act of God, is either deſtructive to the contingency of, or impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of any neceſſity, or infallibility in the event, upon the actions of the wills of men, it hath been in part already, and may in place more convenient in the progreſſe of our preſent diſcourſe, be further evicted and confirmed, by dint of argument and demonſtration. In the meane time my requeſt to him, that ſhall (haply) undertake to anſwer theſe Diſcuſſions, is, that he will not needleſſely trouble either himſelf, his Reader, or me, with producing the Authors, lately either named, or referenced, or any others, as aſſerting the contrary to what I have argued and proved from them, in other places; For I can more willingly grant, then queſtion, that they have many inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, (in other parts of their Writings) with thoſe things, which I have quoted from them. So that for any man to quote them <hi>in oppoſitum,</hi> is to gain nothing to their cauſe, but what is already granted to their hand; only it may prove the eaſing of the Truth from the burthenſomneſſe of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in other Points, in as much as the ſpeaking of contradictions, is a plaine confeſsion of our ignorance, or doubtfulneſſe (at leaſt) of the Truth.</p>
            <p>We have now done with thoſe foure Cautions, ſo neceſſary (as was ſaid)<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> for the keeping our apprehenſions and underſtandings upright under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this great Truth (abſolutely neceſſary to be believed, for the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating and cleering the perfect actuality, and immutability of God) <hi>viz.</hi> that, how, or after what manner ſoever God acteth, or is intereſſed in the ſucceſsive and new Productions of Actions, or Beings in the World, that which he doth in this kinde, he doth it not by any new Influx, Operation,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94900:47"/> or Exertion of himſelf, but by that one great Creative Act, wherein he gave out himſelf from eternity.

               </note>. From this peece of diſcourſe, theſe three things are evident. 1. That the Authors judgement was, that God did not give being unto things, by any multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or diſtinct acts, or workings, but by one and the ſame moſt ſimple word, the efficacy and force whereof extendeth it ſelf to the production of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Creatures or Beings, when, and at what time, or times, the Speaker pleaſeth. 2. That this Word was not ſpoken by him in time, but in, or from, eternity. 3. (And laſtly) that notwithſtanding the Word was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from eternity, yet the Effects or Productions of it, receive their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Beings in time.

But (for authorities) I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, with that confident (though briefe) aſſertion of an approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our own (formerly touched;) <hi>For in all Divines opinions,</hi> (ſaith the late Biſhop <hi>Davenant) theſe Propoſitions are true; God can will nothing in time; God cannot but have the will, which he hath; He cannot have any will, which he hath not</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">

            <p>Give me now leave to add a Reaſon, or two, (briefly) for the further<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> cleering and aſſerting of this Doctrine. Firſt, it is a known maxime in<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Modus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perandi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequitur mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſſendi.</hi> vid. Thom. 1. part. qu. 89. Art. 1. in cor.</note> Reaſon; that <hi>every thing must needs Act, in proportion, or according, to the manner of the Being of it.</hi> Now the <hi>Being</hi> of God, being moſt abſolutely perfect, the manner of his Acting or Working, muſt needs be moſt perfect alſo. So then all repetition, or multiplication of actings in the Creature, for the obtaining of ſuch ends, which it deſireth, arguing imperfection (a Principle upon which the Apoſtle himſelf builds, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2. <note n="a" place="margin">For the Law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of them, can never with thoſe Sacrifices, which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect. For then would they have ceaſed to be offered, &amp;c.</note>) it muſt needs be agreeable both to Reaſon and Truth, to conceive, that God, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the infinite perfection of his Being, muſt needs reach and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe all his ends (and conſequently give Being to whatſoever he intended ſhould be at any time) by one and the ſame ſimple Act, or Dictate of his Will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Being of God being an eternall Being, the formall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> whereof, (as all the diligent ſurveyours of Eternity unanimouſly agree) ſtandeth in an incommutability, <hi>i. e.</hi> in an abſolute and utter impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of admitting the leaſt alteration or change of Being, unpoſſible it is that he ſhould act any thing in time, other then what he acted, in, or from eternity; becauſe any new acting in time, ſuppoſeth an alteration or change in that Being, which ſo acteth. To act that afterwards, which a man acted not before, infers a manifeſt alteration or change in his Being, as <hi>viz.</hi> from the Poſture, Habit, or Condition of a Man at reſt, to the State or Poſture of a perſon in action. So that if it ſhould be conceived; that God produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth or giveth Being to thoſe various and multiplied effects, which ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively receive Being, and are produced in the World, by a multiplicity or plurality of Acts, it muſt be conceived withall, that all this multiplicity of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94900:49"/> acts was levied and raiſed by him from eternity. But that God from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did not multiply productive acts according to the number of things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in time by him (for if he multiplied them at all, it muſt in reaſon be according to this proportion, or number) is evident from hence; becauſe theſe ſuppoſed multiplied acts muſt be conceived to have been exerted and put forth by him, either together, and (as it were) at one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, or elſe ſucceſſively, one after another. Succeſſively raiſed they could not be; becauſe all ſucceſſion, and diviſibility, are wholly inconſiſten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Together, and at the ſame inſtant they could not be raiſed, it being repugnant to a cauſe that is moſt ſingly, ſimply and indiviſibly one, without all manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of parts, or otherwiſe, as God, or the Divine Eſſence is, to exerciſe a Plurality of acts together, eſpecially really diſtinct, and differing one from another, as the acts we ſpeake of, in caſe they were ſuppoſeable in God, muſt needs be.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhall yet demandingly object, But how can theſe things be?<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> How is it poſſible to conceive, that God by one and the ſame act, and this acted from eternity, ſhould give Being to all that infinite variety of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Motions, and Actions, which are produced ſucceſsively in the courſe and current of time? I anſwer, 1. It is very poſsible to conceive, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power may do any thing, which imports Perfection. Now as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a Degree of Perfection in men, as in point of Wiſdom, Strength, Power, &amp;c. by one and the ſame action, or ingagement of themſelves, to bring ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ends to paſſe; ſo doth it argue nothing but pure and meere perfection, that God by one act, or word ſpeaking, ſhould bring forth a World of ſuch and ſuch a duration, ſo furniſhed in all reſpects, in every part of this dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, as ſeemed beſt to Himſelf, with Creatures, Motions, Actions, and Events of all kinds.</p>
            <p>2. To aid and eaſe our imaginations a little, in conceiving the manner how that great wonder we ſpeake of, may be; <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (I remember) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in his Writings findeth a kind of ſhadow, or reſemblance of it, in the art (as he calleth it) or Principle, by vertue whereof, or out of which, a man Prayeth, or Speaketh, in reſpect of the ſeverall Syllables, Words, or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, which in Praying, or Speaking, he uttereth ſucceſsively by meanes of ſuch a Principle. The art, or skill of Praying, is but one and the ſame Principle in a man; yet by vertue of it, even whileſt it remaines fixed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved in the mind, the man produceth words ſucceſsively, as he pleaſeth, ſuch and ſuch words in the firſt place, ſuch and ſuch other, in the ſecond, &amp;c. In like manner, God by one and the ſame eternall Act, eternally permanent in him, may expreſſe and utter himſelf unto the World by the producing of ſuch and ſuch things in every kinde, according to all variety of times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as himſelf pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>This for anſwer to that great and difficult Objection againſt the perfect actuality of God, raiſed from the ſucceſsive Production of things by Him.</p>
            <p>Another Objection ſeeming to war againſt the ſame Property, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> in God, is this. If God be a pure, and compleat Act, admitting no
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94900:49"/> kinde of Potentiality in his Nature, or Being, how then can he be a free Agent? much leſſe, the firſt of all others, as he is commonly affirmed to be? And if it be unpoſsible for him to act otherwiſe, then as he acteth, or to give Being to any other things, then what are produced by vertue of that one act, which he put forth from eternity, muſt he not needs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e conceived to act out of the neceſsity of his Nature, and not out of the liberty, or freedom of his Will?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer more briefly, 1. To act out of the neceſsity of Nature, imports not only the ignorance, or neſcience of what is ſo acted, but an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incapacity in him that acteth, to reflect (with underſtanding) upon his action. And therefore no intellectuall nature, can be truly ſaid to act out of the neceſsity of their natures, but out of the liberty of their wills, becauſe they are capable (at leaſt) of knowing what they act, and by denying, or withholding the conſent of their wills, may prevent, or forbeare any action, that paſſeth from them. Nor doth that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 7. 19. The evill which I would not, that I doe,</hi> any wayes imply the contrary. Becauſe his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not, that when he did that which was <hi>evill,</hi> and <hi>which he hated,</hi> his will for the preſent did not conſent to the act: for had not his will now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, unpoſsible it is that ſuch an act ſhould have been done by him: but <hi>the evill which he would not,</hi> or, <hi>which he hated, [viz.</hi> in the ſtanding, and habituall frame of his heart, and out of the caſe of ſurprizall] <hi>this he did [viz.</hi> through Tentation, or Being prevented with humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.]</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is ſaid (and truly) to be <hi>Agens liberrimum,</hi> the moſt free Agent of all others, 1. In reſpect of the exerciſe of his Act, or execution of what he willeth: he is obnoxious to no diſappointment in what he willeth to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by any Wiſdom or Power whatſoever; whereas all other Agents, are liable, in what they intend to put in execution, to ſuffer a check and failer, from him. 2. He is the moſt <hi>Free Agent,</hi> in reſpect of the elicite Acts of his Will (ſuch are his Purpoſes, Decrees, Intentions, Deſires, &amp;c.) two wayes, 1. As theſe are not occaſioned or raiſed in him by meanes of any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or dependance which he hath upon any of their Objects, or the things Purpoſed, Decreed, Intended or Deſired by him, but proceede out of the meere goodneſſe of his will; whereas the elicite acts of created wills are (for the moſt part, if not alwayes) begotten by ſome neceſſity or other of the things wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led, lying upon him that willeth, as not being compleate in the injoyment of himſelf, without the willing, or obtaining ſuch things. 2. As theſe acts of his will ariſe and flow from their Principle or Fountaine, with a greater enlargement thereof, and more ſtrength of exertion, then the like acts proceeding from the wills of any other Agent, or Agents whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) the immutability of his Will, or the determination of it to things actually and <hi>de facto</hi> willed by him, is no impeachment to the liberty or freedome of his Will; but only ſuppoſeth, or demonſtrateth it to be another kinde of liberty or freedom, much more excellent and perfect, then that which is found in the wills of Men or Angels. That liberty of will, which is competent unto, and found in, theſe, includes a Peccability, or Potentiality unto ſin, which argueth weakneſſe, or non-perfection: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the unchangeable rectitude of the Will of God, excluding all poſſibility of ſinning, excludeth no degree at all of liberty or freedom from it, but only

            <p>Having thus cleered this foundation of Truth, the perfect <hi>Actuality</hi> of<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> the Divine Eſſence or Being, let us conſider what we may ſafely, and with evidence of deduction, build upon it. If then God be a pure and meere act, without all Potentiality, or Poſſibility of change, in one kinde or other, then thoſe volitions, or acts of his Will, which (with the Scriptures) we call Election, Reprobation, Predeſtination, &amp;c. are not to be conceived as acts that are paſt, <note n="a" place="margin">Caven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt, ne falſâ qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Divinae quaſi praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itum cogite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.

So that (for example) when God prevailes by his Word and Spirit with men in time to believe, and during this their believing, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame gracious means towards their further eſtabliſhment, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, he is ſaid to have <hi>elected</hi> them; not becauſe he had formerly paſſed any act of <hi>Election</hi> concerning them, which is now at an end, and ceaſeth; but becauſe he doth by them, or to them, as men uſe to do by Trees, when they have <hi>choſen</hi> them out of the Forreſt, for building, they fell, ſaw, hew, and every wayes prepare and fit them for ſuch places in the building they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, for which they are moſt proper and uſefull.

Hence it is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth his care of doing thoſe things, which might exempt him, not from under any decree of Reprobation, which had already paſſed againſt him, but from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under any ſuch diſpleaſure of God, which putteth men into an eſtate of Reprobation, <hi>i. e.</hi> Alienateth the heart, will, and care of God from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Secondly, if God be a Perfect, Pure, and compleat Act, all in preſent<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> Being, and Doing, which is any wayes poſſible for him either to be, or to do, then muſt his Counſells and Decrees concerning men, and particularly thoſe lately mentioned, Election, Reprobation, Predeſtination, &amp;c. of neceſſity reſpect them, and relate unto them, not as individually or perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, or as ſuch, or ſuch men, by Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in a ſpecificall conſideration, or as Perſons ſo, or ſo, qualified; or, of ſuch, or ſuch a condition. So that (for example) God cannot be ſaid to elect, or to have elected, <hi>Peter,</hi> ſimply conſidered as <hi>Peter,</hi> or as a Perſon conſiſting of that individuall body and ſoul, of which <hi>Peter</hi> conſiſteth; but as an <hi>individuum,</hi> or Perſon of ſuch, or ſuch a Species, Sort, or, kinde of men. The reaſon why an election of men in a meere perſonall conſideration, muſt needs be inconſiſtent with the perfect Actuality of God, is, becauſe it evidently ſuppoſeth a mutability, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility<note place="margin">Concerning the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of God, See more cap. 10. Sect. 40, &amp;c. of this Diſcourſe.</note> of change in him, as <hi>viz.</hi> in point of affection, as from hatred unto love; which an election of them according to a ſpecificall conſideration doth not. For if God (for example) ſhall be ſuppoſed to have choſen <hi>Peter,</hi> ſimply and meerly as <hi>Peter,</hi> and not as a Believer, or as a godly or righteous Perſon; and if it ſhall be ſuppoſed withall, that <hi>Peter</hi> before his converſion, was a wicked and ungodly man (as the greateſt part of men are before their converſion, eſpecially at ſome diſtance of time from it) it will follow, that God in time comes to love that Perſon, which ſometimes he hated; which evidently ſuppoſeth a mutability or changeableneſſe of affection in God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a change made in the Creature. The Scripture ſaith expreſly of God, that <hi>he hateth all workers of iniquity</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 5. 5.</note>. Therefore whileſt <hi>Peter</hi> was a worker of iniquity, moſt certaine it is that God hated him. But upon this <hi>Peters</hi> converſion, it muſt be ſuppoſed that God layd aſide his affection of hatred towards him, and put on the affection of love in ſtead thereof; which imports a Palpable and plaine change in him.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that ſuch an Election as I Plead for, <hi>viz.</hi> of men under a ſpecificall conſideration, ſuppoſeth ſuch a mutability in God, as this: becauſe<note place="margin">§. 31.</note>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:94900:51"/> according to the notion and tenor of this Election, God muſt be ſuppoſed one while to hate <hi>Peter, viz.</hi> during the time of his non-converſion, and whileſt he is <hi>a worker of iniquity,</hi> and another while to love him, <hi>viz.</hi> when he is regenerate; I anſwer, no: the Election aſſerted infers no mutability or change in God at all. The reaſon is, becauſe it doth not make the perſons of men, meerly, and ſimply as ſuch, the Preciſe and formall object of election; but conſidered as the individua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls of ſuch a determinate Species, Sort, or Kinde of Men, or rather the ſpecies it ſelf of ſuch and ſuch Men. Now as it is as truly, as commonly, ſaid in Logique, that though all the Individualls of a Species be corruptible, may change or die, yet the Species it ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines incorruptible, and cannot be changed: ſo in the caſe in hand, the Love of God in Election, (and there is the ſame reaſon of his hatred in Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) being Primarily and directly pitched and ſet upon a certaine Species of Men, and not upon the Perſons of Men, ſave by accident, and indirectly only, and in a conſequentiall way, hence it followes, that the Proper and formall Object of Gods Love, (and ſo of his hatred) being unchangeable, his love it ſelf cannot be ſaid to be changed, nor yet his hatred, though the perſons of Men change never ſo often, from good to evill, or from evill to good. Though all the righteous Perſons on the Earth ſhould apoſtatize, and turne wicked, yet the Species or Kinde of righteous Men would be ſtill the ſame, the ſame in Nature, Definition, Worth, Lovelineſſe, and in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is eſſentiall or proper unto the Species. And as God loved this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or Species of Men with this love of Election, <hi>before the foundation of the World,</hi> (as the Apoſtles Phraſe is) and conſequently whileſt as yet no individuall Perſon thereof was in actuall Being, in like manner, were all the righteous Perſons in the World dead, or degenerated into wicked men, the Love of God towards the Species would be ſtill the ſame; yea and towards all particular Perſons of Men that ſhould at any time riſe up in this Species. According to this notion of Election, it argues no mutability, or change at all in God, either in reſpect of his love, or hatred, that one while he loves, and another while hates, one and the ſame Perſon: becauſe it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no Perſon of Men, to be any otherwiſe, or in any other conſideration, the object of his Election, or of his elective Love, but only as righteous; nor any Perſon of Man the object of his Reprobation, or reprobating hatred, but only as wicked, or ungodly. As it argueth no change or alteration in the Heavens, or in the Climates thereof, that a Man removing himſelf by travell out of a cold Climate, where he felt the inconvenience of cold, into an hot, partakes here of the accommodation of warmth: it only argues, a change in the Man in reſpect of his Reſidence and Place: ſo neither doth it argue any change at all in God, nor of any affection in him, in caſe a Man paſſing from ſin, where he liv'd under the hatred and diſpleaſure of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to righteouſneſſe, injoyes in this condition the Love and Favour of God. This only imports a change in ſuch a Man, but no change at all in God, or in any affection of his. He now loves, but where, and what, he loved before, and hates ſtill, as before he hated. Nor doth this Notion or Doctrine of Election, and Reprobation, any wayes ſuppoſe, either righteouſneſſe to be the cauſe of the former, or ſin, of the latter; as opportunity may be given in the Proceſſe of the Diſcourſe more fully to ſhew.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if the Actuality of God, or the Divine Eſſence, be ſo abſolute<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> and full, as Proof hath been made, then can there be no ſuch Act, or Decree in him, as the Reprobation of Men, perſonally conſidered, from eternity:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94900:51"/> The Reaſon is, becauſe all men being in the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> whileſt he was yet ſtanding, juſt, and righteous, were partakers of the ſame condition of righteouſneſſe with him; and conſequently of all Priviledges, amongſt which the Love and Favour of God are predominant, equitably belonging to this condition. So that all Men, whileſt they were found in this condition or eſtate of righteouſneſſe, were the objects of Gods Love, who is frequently in Scripture ſaid to <hi>love the righteous</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 146. 8.</note>, to <hi>bleſse the righteous</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 5. 12.</note>, <hi>with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to compaſſe the righteous, as with a Shield,</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore all this while, I meane during their innocency and integrity in <hi>Adam,</hi> there was none of them, that could poſſibly be the Objects of Gods hatred, or (conſequently) of his Reprobation. So that if any of them be reprobated, it muſt be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and in time: for upon the ſaid ſuppoſition, which is manifeſtly true, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were all the Objects of his Love, whileſt they were righteous and innocent, it could not be from eternity. And beſides; if God loved them, perſonally conſidered, it is impoſſible, that without a change in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is abſolutely inconſiſtent with the Perfect actuality of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Being, he ſhould ever hate them, or reprobate them, under the ſame conſideration, or under any other, then as changed perſonally from righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto ſin, from innocency, unto tranſgreſſion. In which caſe God may be ſaid to hate them, though he loved them formerly, without the leaſt ſhadow of a change, either in himſelf, or in his affection, as was lately proved.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, from that compleat <hi>Actuality</hi> of the Divine Eſſence,<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> which hath been argued and aſſerted, it plainely followes, that all Gods Counſells, Purpoſes, and Decrees, are abſolute, unchangeable, irreverſible, upon any terms, ſuppoſitions, or conditions whatſoever. Any change, or poſſibility of change, in any of theſe, ſuppoſeth a change, or poſſibility of a change in him; either of which are diametrally inconſiſtent with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>Actuality,</hi> which excludeth all Potentiality, and capacity of change in what kinde ſoever. It is true many of the Purpoſes and Decrees of God have conditions eſſentially included in them, and which are parts of them; but taking the whole body or ſyſteme of the Decree, they are all abſolute, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable, indiſpenſable. It is one of the great Purpoſes and Decrees of God, that <hi>if Men believe, they ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Here is a condition, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, eſſentially included in the Decree. But this condition doth not make the Decree conditionall, in reference to execution; nor any whit leſſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, then thoſe Decrees are, which have no condition at all framed into them. For let the World ſtand, or fall, let Men, Angels, and Devils, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and oppoſe their utmoſt, this Decree of God ſhall ſtand, and be put <hi>toties quoties</hi> in execution; <hi>if men believe, they ſhall be ſaved.</hi> There is the ſame reaſon of all others, which are of like tenor and frame. And thus from the Perfection of the Divine Nature, we have evinced, 1. The Simplicity thereof: 2. The moſt Pure and abſolute Actuality thereof; and from both theſe, in a way of lawfull, cleer and evident deduction, inferred ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations and concluſions for the ſupport and ſtrengthening of our maine building in this Diſcourſe: We have only one thing further to argue from the Infinite Perfection of the Nature of God. Therefore</p>
            <p>Thirdly, (and laſtly) if God in his Nature and Eſſence be abſolutely<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> and infinitely Perfect, then can He act nothing, Order, Decree nothing, to the Prejudice, or hurt of any Creature whatſoever, but only in a way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and equity, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon the conſideration of ſome demerit, or ſin Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94900:52"/> For not only to act, but to be able to act, unrighteouſly, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend evill, to, or againſt the innocent, argues imperfection, and that in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high degree. Becauſe as <hi>Job</hi> reaſoneth and demandeth on the one hand, <hi>who can bring a cleane thing out of an uncleane?</hi> and concludeth, <hi>not one</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Job. 14 4.</note>; ſo may we on the other, who can bring an <hi>uncleane</hi> thing, out of that which is Perfectly <hi>cleane?</hi> Surely <hi>not one.</hi> If the Nature of God be infinitely Perfect, there can be nothing in it, there can nothing proceede from it, or be done by it, that is unjuſt, nothing unequall, nothing hard, nothing that any wayes bendeth, or inclineth to the hurt or damage of the Creature, being yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. And if ſo, then can there be no ſuch purpoſe, no ſuch Decree in him, as men commonly call, <hi>Reprobation,</hi> or an irreverſible Decreeing, or Ordaining of men (much leſſe far the greateſt part of Men) to eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, from eternity; no nor yet any ſuch Preterition of men, whether we conceive it under the Notion of an act, or of a meere Negation, which, even<note place="margin">Lenitate verbi triſticiam rei mitigante.

And indeed the exchange of the word, Reprobation, for a Preterition, no more eaſeth God, or vindicates the honour of his Grace, Goodneſſe, Love, Bounty, towards the Creature, then it would the juſtice or clemency of a Judge, to pleade on his behalf, that though he ſentenceth guiltleſſe men unto death, yet he takes ſpeciall care that execution ſhall not be done upon them with hempen, but with ſilken Halters. For as <hi>not to feede</hi> a <hi>mans enemy, when he is an hungry;</hi> or <hi>when he is thirſty,</hi> not <hi>to give him to drink,</hi> is interpreted by God, to be an <hi>avenging of a mans ſelfe (Rom. 12. verſ.</hi> 19. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.) in like manner for God to leave Men in ſuch a condition, or upon ſuch terms, in, and under which it is ſimply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to eſcape <hi>the vengeance of eternall fire,</hi> is conſtructively, and (as we uſe to ſay) neither better, nor worſe, then, to Ordaine, or Decree him in a Poſitive way to the ſuffering of this <hi>vengeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here it is commonly pleaded on Gods behalf, and ſaid; yea but it is no<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> unrighteous thing, no unequall or hard thing in God, to Reprobate, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate to deſtruction, and that from eternity, which, or how many of his Creatures he pleaſeth, without any conſideration of ſin at all. This is his lawfull and juſt Prerogative, as he is the abſolute Lord of his Creatures: and if he uſeth it in reference to ſuch, or ſuch of them, who can ſay unto him, why doſt thou ſo? Or however, if he be conceived to have looked upon Men, as lapſed in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo, ſinfull, when he Paſſed by ſo many of them, and left them in the hand of eternall ruine, without all poſſibility of an eſcape, is there ſo much as any appearance of unrighteouſneſſe, or hardneſſe, in this?

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94900:53"/> and beſt becomming God, that he ſhould conſtitute and ordain the obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, to be the Law of Juſtification, Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto Men: and the neglect, or non-obſervation of this Law, to be the Law of condemnation, and of death. God here interpoſeth with his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and declares to them, that his Will and Pleaſure is otherwiſe; and that he Conſtitutes and Ordaines Faith in his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to be the Law of Juſtification and Life, whether joyned with the obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, or without it; and on the other hand, unbelief, to be the Law of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of death, though in conjunction with the ſtricteſt obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. This Prerogative indeed God Himſelf pleads, and aſſerts to Himſelf, with a majeſtique and God-like authority, ſpeaking thus to <hi>Moſes: I will have mercy, on whom I will have mercy,</hi> and <hi>I will have compaſsion, an whom I will have compaſsion</hi>

In calling him, a <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Creator,</hi> he cleerly intimates, that there is a kinde of naturall tie or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement upon every Author of Being, whether unto perſons, or things, which <hi>promiſeth</hi> unto thoſe who receive Being from them in any kinde, a regular and due care in them for their preſervation and good. The relation of a Parent, Father, or Mother, promiſeth unto the Child, a regular care, deſire, and endevour in the Parent, for the comfort and well being of it. By vertue of this <hi>Promiſe</hi> it is, that (as the Apoſtle inform us) <hi>Parents</hi> ſtand bound to <hi>provide, and lay up for their Children</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 14.</note>. And Parents, who do carefully perform ſuch ingagements as theſe unto their Children, may well and properly be called, <hi>Faithfull</hi> Parents. So the Relation of a Mother <hi>promiſeth</hi> unto the Infant born of her, and that with much aſſeveration, and naturall ſolemnity of proteſt, all care and tenderneſſe for the well being of it. In reſpect of this ſolemn <hi>promiſe</hi> it is, that God himſelf demandeth; <hi>Can a Woman forget her ſucking Child, that ſhee ſhould not have compaſsion on the Sonne of her Womb</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eſa. 49. 15.</note>? implying that ſuch Women are very unnaturall and <hi>unfaithfull</hi> that <hi>can.</hi> Yea, <hi>God</hi> himſelf ſpeaking thus of the <hi>Oſtrich, ſhee is hardened against her young ones, as if they were not hers, (Job.</hi> 39. 16.) cleerly implies, that this Creature only excepted, there is an univerſall tenderneſſe and care in all others, towards their young ones. In like manner every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath a very great and rich aſſurance from that very relation wherein it ſtands unto <hi>God,</hi> as a Creator, that upon a regular deportment of it ſelf, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and ſuch as any wayes becomes a Creature, towards the Creator or Maker of it, it ſhall receive protection, preſervation, and every good thing from him. Yea the Scripture plainly implieth, that there muſt be a very great breach on the Creatures part in point of degeneration and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, before God lookes upon himſelf as diſcharged from that care for the preſervation and well being of it, which he promiſed (as it were) unto it, in his being the Author of Being unto it. Conſider that paſſage in the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94900:54"/> Prophet <hi>Eſay: For it is a People of no underſtanding: therefore he that</hi> MADE <hi>them, will not have mercy on them; and</hi> HE THAT FORMED THEM, <hi>will ſhew</hi> THEM NO FAVOVR <note n="a" place="margin">Eſa. 27. 11.</note>. Doth not this cleerly imply, that had not this <hi>People</hi> been very enormouſly and intolerably corrupted, and degenerated (as it were) into the ſpirit and actions of bruite beaſts, ſuffering the glory of the Work of God in their Creation utterly to ſink within them, had they but quitted themſelves like a People of any competent reaſon or <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the relation of a Creator in God towards them, would have wrought ſo effectually in him on their behalf, that he would have <hi>ſhewed them mercy and favour</hi> in delivering them. The Creature muſt depart and go aſtray very far from the Creator, and grow (in a manner) quite out of kinde, before the Creator will, or can, ceaſe to know, love, and reſpect it, as his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Hence it is that we finde God himſelf ſo frequently mentioning, and inſiſting upon his Relation of a <hi>Creator</hi> unto his People, when he ſeekes to ſatisfie and comfort them, as touching his love towards them, and care over them. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord that</hi> MADE <hi>thee, and that</hi> FORMED <hi>thee from the womb, which will help thee, Feare not, O Jacob, my Servant,</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Eſa. 44. 2.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So again: <hi>Hearken unto me, O houſe of Jacob, and all the remnant of the houſe of Iſrael, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb; And even to your old Age I am He, and even to hoare haires will I carry you: I have</hi> MADE, <hi>and I will beare, even I will carry and will deliver you</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eſa. 46. 3, 4.</note>. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the Holy One of Iſrael, and</hi> HIS MAKER, <note n="d" place="margin">Eſa. 45. 11.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Once more, (to paſſe by many other places of like import) <hi>But now, O Lord, thou art our Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are the Clay, and thou our Potter, and we are all the work of thy Hand</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Eſa. 64. 8.</note>. As in the former paſſages, God ſtrengthened the Faith of this People by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring them that he was their <hi>Creator, and Maker,</hi> and conſequently bare the affection and love of a Creator towards them; So in this laſt, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves declare how effectually that conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Relation of a Creator in God towards them, had wrought upon them to the ſtrengthening of their Faith in his Love towards them, and care over them; and accordingly plead the ſame in their requeſts to him.</p>
            <p>Nor is it prejudiciall in the leaſt to that demonſtration, which we intend<note place="margin">§. 40.</note> to make from the ſaid paſſages (with their fellowes) <hi>viz.</hi> of the love and care of God, as a Creator, to all the Works of his Hands, to pretend, that in theſe places and the like, <hi>God</hi> ſpeaks only to his Church, and his Elect ones. For, 1. The Relation of a <hi>Creator</hi> in God is uniform, one and the ſame, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Elect (Believers) and towards Reprobates, or Unbelievers; the one being the workmanſhip of his hands, as well as the other: and therefore as promiſing to the one, as to the other, (if they underſtood, or conſidered, the voyce of this promiſe.) 2. If <hi>God,</hi> notwithſtanding the Relation of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in him, were likely to have reprobated his Creatures from eternity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially had this people believed that he had <hi>de facto,</hi> ſo reprobated mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of them, it had been a very ſlender ſupport and incouragement to their Faith, that he ſhould remember them of his relation unto them, as their Creator. For might not they, upon ſuch a ſuppoſition as this, have replied unto him; Lord, why doſt thou ſo much inculcate into us the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy Being our <hi>Maker,</hi> and <hi>Creator,</hi> as if there were any thing in this to comfort us, or to relieve our Faith concerning thy love to us, or care for us? Do we not know that thou art a <hi>Creator</hi> to many thouſand thouſands in the World, whom notwithſtanding thou hateſt, and caſted'ſt out of thy Love without any cauſe given on their parts, from eternity? Therefore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94900:55"/> what aſſurance of grace and favour with thee can we receive upon any ſuch account as this, that thou art our <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Creator?</hi> So that evident it is, that <hi>God</hi> himſelf doth acknowledge a gracious tie and ingagement upon him, as a Creator, to love, reſpect, and take care for his Creatures, untill they voluntarily renounce and diſclaime their relation unto him, as his Creatures, by walking rebelliouſly againſt him, or ſuffering the <hi>God</hi> of this World, to deface the glory of his workmanſhip in them. And whereas he compareth himſelf in tenderneſſe and care over his Creature, unto an Hen, <hi>which ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth her Chickens under her wings,</hi> they who make him like unto <hi>the Oſtrich, which leaveth her Eggs in the Earth, and forgetteth that the foote may cruſh them, or that the wilde Beasts may break them, and is hardened againſt her young</hi>

               <hi>ones, as if they were not hers,</hi> (which aſtorgy <hi>God</hi> himſelf imputeth to want of <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>underſtanding in her</hi>) have the greater ſin, repreſenting him altogether unlike unto himſelf.</p>
            <p>Other Scriptures there are exceeding many, which teſtifie aloud, the grace<note place="margin">§. 41.</note> and love and goodneſſe of <hi>God,</hi> as a Creator, towards his Creatures. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works</hi>

But had he intended from eternity to abandon the far greateſt part of the beſt of <hi>his works,</hi> Men, to <hi>the vengeance of eternall Fire,</hi> could his <hi>tender mercies</hi> (in any tolerable ſence) be ſaid to be <hi>over</hi> theſe? Eſpecially can thoſe men juſtifie <hi>David</hi> in ſuch a ſaying as this, who conceive and teach, that whatſoever <hi>God</hi> doth in a providentiall way for ſuch Men, ſo abandoned, as in <hi>cauſing his Sun to riſe, or his Raine</hi> to fall, <hi>upon them,</hi> in <hi>filling their hearts with food and gladneſse,</hi> in giving them Health, Wealth, Liberty, Peace, &amp;c. he doth all with an intent to harden them, and ſo to bring that heavy deſtruction upon them with the more ſeverity and terror in the end, whereunto they were predeſtinated and appointed from the beginning? Will Men call Health, Peace, Liberty, Meats, Drinks, &amp;c. given with an intent to become ſnares unto Men, and to bring inevitable damnation upon them, the <hi>tender Mercies</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> The holy Man <hi>Job,</hi> being conſcious to himſelf of no ſignall departure from <hi>God</hi> by unrighteouſneſſe in any kinde, looked upon that diſpenſation of <hi>God</hi> in ſo ſeverely afflicting him, as very ſtrange, and that only upon this account, that he was his Creator. <hi>Thy hands have made me, and faſhioned me together round about</hi> [meaning, that he was the ſole Author of Being unto him] <hi>yet thou dost destroy me. Remember, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, that thou haſt</hi> MADE <hi>me as the Clay: and wilt thou bring me into the duſt againe</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Job 10. 8. 9.</note>? If <hi>Job</hi> thought it ſtrange, that <hi>God</hi> being the Author of Life and Being unto him, ſhould without any grand offence or provocation given him, handle him with ſo much ſeverity (as he conceived) in the outer Man, how incredible would the Doctrine of thoſe Men have been unto him, who teach, that God from eternity hath irreverſibly conſigned over to the mercileſſe torments of Hell fire, millions of millions of Men, who never offended, or provoked him in the leaſt? The ſame Author doth elſewhere alſo notably aſſert the univerſall Love, Care, and Reſpects of God as a Creator towards men, alledging the conſideration of theſe, as a grand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement upon him, to deale juſtly and equally with his Servants. <hi>If I did deſpiſe the cauſe of my man ſervant, or of my maid ſervant, when they contended with me, what then ſhall I doe, when God riſeth up? and when he viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him? Did not he that</hi> made <hi>me in the womb,</hi> make <hi>him? and did not one faſhion us in the womb</hi>

After the ſame manner, <hi>Elihu</hi> alſo advanceth the poore into equall reſpects with Princes, before God: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they, as well as theſe, are the <hi>works of his hands.

            <p>From the Scriptures lately produced, (unto which double their number, confederate in the ſame Truth with them, might be added) it manifeſtly appeares, that ſuch an hatred or rejection of the Creature by God from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as is commonly taught, and received amongſt us, is broadly and wholly inconſiſtent with that Love, Tenderneſſe, and Reſpect, which the Relation of a Creator to a Creature every where imports: and conſequently, is not to be looked upon as any Prerogative worthy of him.</p>

Yea, I ſhall make it appeare from ancient Records of beſt credit, and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of moderne Divines themſelves, of beſt account adverſaries in the point) that Univerſall Attonement by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was a Doctrine generally taught and held in the Churches of <hi>Christ</hi> for three hundred yeares together, next after the Apoſtles. And if I conceived it worth the undertaking, or were minded to turne the ſtreame of my Diſcourſe that way, I queſtion not but I could make it as cleer as the Sun ſhining in his might, that there is no <hi>Article of the Goſpell</hi> (as this Mans dialect is) I mean, no great or weighty point of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> can ſtand with a rationall conſiſtency, unleſſe the Doctrine of <hi>Univerſall Attonement,</hi> be admitted for a Truth.

               </gap>es holily and like a Chriſtian, he acts in full contradiction to ſuch a Principle, and happily denies that in practice, which erroneouſly he holds in judgement. God in ſuch caſes as theſe, makes <hi>Grapes to grow on Thornes,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94900:56"/> and Figgs on Thiſtles:</hi> nor doth there want any thing, but Sence and Viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the diſproportion between the cauſe and the effect, to make the lives and wayes of ſuch perſons, miraculous. Neither doth any thing, nor all things, that I could ever yet meet with, either from the Tongues, or Pens of the greateſt Patrons of particular Redemption, deliver me from under much admiration, that conſciencious and learned Men, profeſſing ſubjection of judgement to the Scriptures, ſhould either deny univerſall, or aſſert particular, Redemption; conſidering that the Scriptures, in particularity, plainneſſe, and expreſneſs of words &amp; phraſe, do more then ten times over deliver the former, whereas the latter is no where aſſerted by them, but only ſtands upon certaine venturous conſequences and deductions, which the weake judgements of Men, ſo much accuſtomed to error and miſtake, preſume to levy from them; together with ſuch arguments and grounds, which upon examination, will be found, either to have no conſiſtency with the ſound Principles, either of Reaſon, or Religion; or elſe no legitimate coherence with the cauſe, which they pretend unto. Let us firſt hearken unto the Scriptures lifting up their voyces together for the Redemption of all Men by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: we ſhall afterwards in due proceſſe of Diſcourſe, give a faire conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe inferences and conſequences of Men, wherein the ſtrength of their Scripture Proofes ſtandeth for the ſupport of the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>And firſt it is conſiderable, that the Scriptures doe not only ſpeak to the<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> heart of the Doctrine aſſerted, in great variety of Texts, and Places, but alſo in great Veyns and Correſpondencies, or Conſorts of Texts, each Conſort conſiſting of ſeverall particulars of like Notion and Phraſe. I ſhall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend only foure of theſe companies unto the Reader: which when we ſhall have pondered, in ſome, or all, the particulars, reſpectively relating unto them, we ſhall add, to make full meaſure, the contributions of ſome ſingle Texts beſides.</p>
            <p>The firſt Diviſion or Squadron of Scriptures, which ſpeak aloud the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> of Redemption by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are ſuch, which preſent the gift and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as relating indifferently unto the <hi>World.</hi> The name of this kinde of Scriptures, for the number of them, may be, <hi>Legion; for they are many.</hi> Some of the principall and beſt known of them, are theſe. <hi>So God loved</hi> THE WORLD, <hi>that he gave his only begotten, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 3. 16. <hi>That</hi> THE WORLD <hi>through him ſhould be ſaved, verſ.</hi> 17.

Joh. 12. 48. <hi>For God was in Chriſt reconciling the</hi> WORLD <hi>unto Himſelf, &amp;c. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 19. To omit many others.</p>
            <p>The ſecond poſt of Scriptures, ſtanding up to maintaine the ſame Doctrine<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> with uniformity of expreſſions amongſt themſelves, are ſuch, which inſure the Ranſome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Will, or Deſire of God for matters of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unto ALL MEN, and EVERY MAN. Some of theſe are: <hi>who gave Himſelf a Ranſome for</hi> ALL. 1 Tim. 2. 6. <hi>Becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for</hi> ALL, <hi>then were all dead: and that he died</hi> FOR ALL, <hi>that they who live, &amp;c. 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15.—that he by the Grace of God, ſhould taſte of Death</hi> FOR EVERY MAN.

            <p>A third ſort or party of Scriptures, confederate with the former (for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> of import, and between themſelves, for matter of expreſſion) are ſuch, which hold forth and promiſe ſalvation indifferently, to <hi>Him,</hi> and to <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> will, or ſhall believe. Of this ſort are theſe (with their fellowes.)—<hi>and</hi> HIM <hi>that commeth unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Joh. 6. 37.—HE <hi>that believeth in me, ſhall never thirſt, verſ.</hi> 35. HE <hi>that believeth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Mar. 16. 16.—<hi>That</hi> WHOSOEVER <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in Him, ſhould not periſh,</hi> &amp;c. Joh. 3. 16.—<hi>That through his Name,</hi> WHOSOEVER <hi>believeth in Him, ſhall receive remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> Acts 10. 43. <hi>Even the Righteouſneſse of God, which is by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> UNTO ALL, <hi>and upon</hi> all, <hi>that believe—For</hi> all <hi>have ſinned.</hi> Rom. 3. 22, 23. It were eaſie to make this pile alſo much greater.</p>
            <p>A fourth aſſociation of Scriptures, all pregnant with the Doctrine we<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> aſſert, conſiſts of ſuch places, where Chriſt is ſaid to have died for thoſe, who yet may periſh, yea and actually do periſh: and again, where ſuch Men are ſaid to have been <hi>bought</hi> by him, and to have been <hi>ſanctified by his blood,</hi> who yet through their own negligence and wilfulneſſe in ſinning, bring deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon themſelves, and periſh everlaſtingly. Places of this kinde are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly known. <hi>Deſtroy not Him with thy meat,</hi> FOR WHOM CHRIST DIED. Rom. 14. 15. <hi>And through thy knowledge ſhall the weak</hi> BROTHER PERISH, FOR WHOM CHRIST DIED. 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 11.—even denying the Lord that</hi> BOVGHT <hi>them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift</hi> DESTRVCTION. 2 Pet 2. 1. <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the World, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them, then the beginning.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20. <hi>Of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe yee, ſhall He be thought worthy, who hath troden under foote the Sonne of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi> Heb. 10. 29. <hi>Then his Lord after he had call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, ſaid unto him, O thou wicked ſervant, I forgave thee all that debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou deſiredſt me. Should not thou alſo have had compaſsion on thy fellow ſervant? And his Lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due to him. So likewiſe ſhall my Heavenly Father doe alſo unto you; if yee from your Heart forgive not every one his Brother their treſpaſſes,</hi> Mat. 18. 32. 33, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let us begin with the Texts of the firſt of the foure Orders mentioned,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> where the Death of <hi>Christ</hi> is preſented as relating unto the <hi>World.</hi> From the tenor and import of all the Scriptures of this Denomination and Tribe, it will be made evident, that <hi>Chriſt died for all Men,</hi> without exception of any; the word, <hi>World,</hi> in theſe places, being neceſſarily to be underſtood in the proper and comprehenſive ſignification of it (I mean, for all Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the <hi>World,</hi> in, and according to, their ſucceſſive generations) and not for any leſſer or ſmaller number, as for ſome of all ſorts, for the Elect, for thoſe that ſhall believe, or the like. We ſhall (for brevity ſake) argue only ſome of theſe places, and leave the light of their interpretations, for a diſcovery of the ſence and meaning of the reſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt propoſed (of theſe) was that place of Renowne, <hi>Joh. 3. 16. So</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 8.</note>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:94900:57"/> 
               <hi>God loved the World, that He gave,</hi> &amp;c. Evident it is, from hence, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>given (viz.</hi> unto Death) for them, or for their ſakes, whoever they be, that are here meant by, <hi>the World.</hi> There are but three ſignifications of the Word, that (to my Remembrance) I ever heard of, as competitors in this place. Firſt, ſome by the <hi>World,</hi> here underſtand, the <hi>elect,</hi> diſperſed up and down the <hi>World.</hi> By the Elect, they meane, all thoſe, and thoſe only who ſhall in time actually be ſaved; whom they call, the <hi>Elect,</hi> becauſe they judge them to have been choſen by God from eternity out of the generality of Man-kinde, with an intent to be by him in time, with a ſtrong hand, and power irreſiſtible, 1. Brought to believe; 2. Cauſed, or made to perſevere believing, unto the end; and 3. Hereupon eternally ſaved; the reſidue of Men being abſolutely rejected, and left to that unavoydable and heavy doome, of periſhing everlaſtingly. But that this is not the ſence of the word, <hi>World,</hi> in the Scripture in hand, will appeare by the light of theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, here tranſlated, <hi>World,</hi> was never known to have any<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> ſuch ſence or ſignification in the Greek Tongue; nor was it, nor is it to be found in any Author, who wrote in this language, before, or about the time, when <hi>John</hi> wrote his Goſpell, in ſuch a ſignification, nor yet in any neere to it. Now the Goſpell, as is generally acknowledged, and that upon ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grounds, being written in the Greek Tongue chiefly for the Gentiles ſake, (amongſt whom this Language was known and underſtood far and neer) that they might be brought to believe, and ſo be ſaved by it, it is no wayes likely, that the Evangeliſt ſhould uſe words, eſpecially in ſuch Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyns, and maine paſſages of it, as this is, in an uncouth, unknown, and unheard ſignification.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor can it be proved, that it is to be taken in the ſence now oppoſed,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> in any other place of the Scriptures themſelves; but in very many places it ſignifies the Univerſall Syſteme, Body, or generality of Men in the World (we ſhall not need to inſtance for the proof of this; places being ſo frequent and obvious) as alſo for that part of the generality of Men, which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and contradiſtinguiſhed to the Saints; <hi>i. e.</hi> to the <hi>Elect</hi> (in their ſence of the word, <hi>Elect,</hi> who yet would have theſe ſignified by, the <hi>World.</hi>) This latter ſignification of the word, <hi>World,</hi> is evident in theſe Scriptures. <hi>We know that we are borne of God, and that the whole</hi> WORLD <hi>lieth in wickedneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Joh. 5 19.</note>. <hi>Even the Spirit of Truth, whom the</hi> World <hi>cannot receive</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 14. 17.</note>, &amp;c. <hi>If yee were of the</hi> WORLD, <hi>the</hi> WORLD <hi>would love her own: but becauſe yee are not of the</hi> WORLD, <hi>but I have choſen you out of the</hi> WORLD, <hi>therefore the</hi> VVORLD <hi>hateth you</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 15. 19. §. 11.</note>. (to omit many others.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. If by the <hi>World</hi> (in the Scripture in hand) be meant <hi>the Elect</hi> (in the ſence of the aſſertors of this ſignification) then it will follow, that God out of his great <hi>love gave Chriſt</hi> unto thoſe, or for thoſe, who ſtood in no need of Him; at leaſt, either to preſerve them from <hi>periſhing,</hi> or to inveſt them with a Right or Title to <hi>eternall life;</hi> which yet are here laid down as the two only, or at leaſt as two maine ends of that great gift. For if exemption from <hi>periſhing,</hi> or ſalvation, be abſolutely, and without all conſideration, awarded or decreed by God unto Men before, or from eternity, they have a full Right and Title unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or unto the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of them, by vertue of this award or decree, without the intervening of any thing elſe whatſoever. For what better Right or Title can there be to the injoyment of any thing, then a decree of Heaven? or the award of him, who hath an
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94900:57"/> unqueſtionable Right and Power to diſpoſe of all injoyments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as, and to whom, he pleaſeth? But more of this conſequence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſtructure it ſelf of the ſentence, and tenor of the words, riſeth up<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> againſt this ſence of the word in queſtion. For 1. If by the word, <hi>World,</hi> we underſtand, the <hi>Elect,</hi> we deſtroy the very <hi>Grammar</hi> of the place, and make it an uncouth and harſh ſentence, ſuch (doubtleſſe) as cannot be parallel'd, in any Author, nor yet in the Scriptures themſelves. Read we then the place thus, <hi>So God loved His Elect, that He gave His only begotten Sonne, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>—I demand how, or in what regular ſence that Univerſall diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive particle, <hi>whoſoever,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, every one that, ſhall be underſtood? It is a thing generally known to thoſe that underſtand any thing in the Rules of <hi>Grammar,</hi> yea the vulgar dialect of thoſe that ſpeak Reaſon or common Sence, confirmeth it, that partitive or diſtributive Particles of Speech, alwayes ſuppoſe a difference (at leaſt in poſſibility) between the things parted, or diſtributed, and this in reference to what occaſioneth the diſtribution. As for example; Suppoſe a great King having many Sons, ſhould expreſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus: I ſo love my Children, that which ſoever of them ſhall be dutifull unto me, I will beſtow Principalities, Dukedomes, or other great matters upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould he not plainly imply a poſſibility (at leaſt) that ſome of them might not prove dutifull unto him? In like manner, if the word, <hi>World,</hi> in the Scripture in hand, ſhould ſignifie, <hi>the Elect;</hi> the diſtributive, <hi>whoſoever,</hi> muſt needs im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly, that ſome of theſe [<hi>Elect</hi>] might poſſibly not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> and ſo <hi>periſh;</hi> becauſe <hi>beleeving,</hi> and <hi>not periſhing</hi> thereupon, occaſion the diſtribution here made.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though our Saviour, in this Period of Scripture, mentioneth only the<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> benefit intended by God in the gift of his Son, to thoſe that ſhall believe, <hi>viz. non-periſhing,</hi> and the obtaining of <hi>everlaſting life;</hi> yet he plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and ſuppoſeth withall, the miſery and loſſe, which they ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuffer, who ſhall not believe. Except this he ſuppoſed, we ſhall alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether misfigure our Saviours Mind and Scope in the place, and make him ſpeak, more like a Man void of underſtanding, then himſelf. For then the taſte and ſavour of his words, would be this: <hi>God ſo loved the World, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth,</hi> or not believeth, <hi>in Him, ſhould not periſh, but,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore certaine it is, that he in the place in hand, as well inſinuates the condemnation, or periſhing of thoſe, who ſhall not <hi>believe,</hi> as aſſerts the ſalvation or non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> periſhing of thoſe, who ſhall <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> And beſides, it is contrary to Reaſon, eſpecially in ſeriouſneſſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in a poſitive and ſtrict manner to ſuſpend that upon the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch or ſuch a condition, which may be had without any ſuch perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. This then being granted, that our Saviour here ſuppoſeth the certaine periſhing of thoſe, who ſhall not <hi>believe,</hi> the place, according to their ſence, who by, <hi>the World,</hi> will needs underſtand, <hi>the Elect,</hi> muſt run thus: <hi>So God loved the Elect, that whoſoever</hi> of them <hi>believed, ſhould not periſh:</hi> but on the contrary, that whoſoever of them ſhould not believe, ſhould periſh. Which (according to their Principles, againſt whom we now argue,) is, as if a man ſhould ſay, which ſoever of my ſheep, is no ſheep, but a goate, ſhall have no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture with his fellowes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They who by <hi>the World,</hi> here underſtand, <hi>the Elect,</hi> muſt, if they will<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> not baulk with their Principles, ſuppoſe that Chriſt ſpeaks at no better Rate of Wiſdom, or Sence, in this Scripture, then thus: <hi>So God loved the World,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94900:58"/> that He gave His only begotten Sonne,</hi> that whoſoever did that, which was not poſſible for them to decline, or not to do, <hi>ſhould not periſh, but,</hi> &amp;c. Who ever, being ſerious and in his wits, required that in the nature of a condition from any Man, eſpecially in order to the obtaining of ſome great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant thing, which he, of whom it was required upon ſuch terms, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated, or had no Liberty or Power, but to performe? what Father ever promiſed his Son his Eſtate, either in whole, or in part, upon condition, that whileſt he rode upon an Horſe, he ſhould not go on foote? or upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he would do that, which a force greater he was able to reſiſt, ſhould neceſſitate him to do? So that the whole tenor and carriage of the verſe, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the interpretation of the word, <hi>World,</hi> hitherto encountred; a meer nullity in Sence, Reaſon, and Truth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Context and words immediately preceding, will at no hand endure<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> that ſence of the word, <hi>World,</hi> againſt which we have declared hitherto. This little word, <hi>for,</hi> FOR <hi>God ſo loved,</hi> &amp;c. being cauſall, importeth, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a connexion of theſe words, with what went before, but ſuch a connexion or Relation, as that which intercedes between the cauſe and the effect. So that the words in hand muſt be looked upon as aſſigning or exhibiting the Cauſe, or Reaſon of that effect, which was immediately before mentioned. This being granted (as without breach of conſcience it can hardly be denied) it will appear as cleer as the light of the Sun, that by the word, <hi>World,</hi> (in the place under Conteſt) cannot be meant the <hi>Elect</hi> only. The tenor of the two next foregoing Verſes (for together they make but one intire ſentence) is this: <hi>And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſse, even ſo must the Sonne of Man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in Him, or, every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> So that the effect here mentioned and expreſſed, is the Salvation and everlaſting happineſſe of what Perſon, or Perſons ſoever of Men, or of Man-kinde, that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Reaſon or Cauſe hereof our Saviour diſcovers, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, in the words in hand: <hi>For God ſo loved the World, that He gave,</hi> &amp;c. If now by, <hi>the World,</hi> we ſhall underſtand, only the <hi>Elect,</hi> the Reaſon or Cauſe here aſſigned of the pre-mentioned effect, will be found, inadequate to it, and inſufficient to produce it. For Gods <hi>Love</hi> to the Elect, and his <hi>giving</hi> his Son for their Salvation only, is no ſufficient cauſe to procure, or produce the Salvation of WHOSOEVER ſhall, or ſhould, believe on him. For certaine it is, that there is Salvation in <hi>Christ</hi> for no more, then for whom God intended there ſhould be Salvation in him. If there be Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in him, for none, but for the Elect only, then is it not true, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believes in him ſhall be ſaved. For certaine it is, that no Mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving puts any Salvation into Chriſt for him: therefore if it were not there for him, before he believed, yea or whether he beleeved, or not, neither would it be there for him, though, or in caſe, he ſhould believe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. (And laſtly) that by the word, <hi>World,</hi> in the Scripture in hand, is not meant, <hi>the Elect,</hi> nor any thing equivalent hereunto, is evident alſo from the Context, in the <hi>Verſe</hi> and words immediately following, where our Saviour goeth forward in his Doctrine, Thus. <hi>For God ſent not His Sonne into the World, to condemne the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 17.</note>. This Particle, <hi>for,</hi> being (as we lately noted) Cauſall, or Racioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, plainly ſheweth, that he uſeth the word, <hi>World,</hi> or ſpeaks of the <hi>World</hi> in this <hi>Verſe,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the condemnation of it, in the ſame ſence, wherein he ſpake of it in the former, and the meanes of the Salvation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94900:58"/> of it: otherwiſe he ſhould not argue <hi>ad idem, i. e.</hi> to the point in hand. Now then to make him here to ſay, that <hi>God ſent not his Sonne into the World, [i. e.</hi> to take the nature, or to live in the condition, of <hi>the Elest,] to condemne the Elect, but that the Elect,</hi> &amp;c. is to make him <hi>ſpeak, as never man</hi> (I ſuppoſe) <hi>ſpake,</hi> but not for excellency of Wiſdom, or gracefulneſſe of expreſſion, but for weakneſſe in both. To ſay, that <hi>God ſent not his Sonne into the World, to condemne his Elect,</hi> were but to beate the Aire, or to fight againſt a ſhadow; I mean, ſolemnly to deny that, which no man was ever likely to imagine, or affirm.

            </p>
            <p>A ſecond interpretation of this word aſſerted by ſome, is, that by <hi>the</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> 
               <hi>World,</hi> is meant <hi>genus humanum,</hi> or Mankinde, indefinitely conſidered, <hi>i. e.</hi> (if I rightly underſtand the minde of thoſe, who thus interpret) as neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting all, nor any of the <hi>individiuums,</hi> or perſons contained in, or under, this <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or kinde, but only the ſpecificall nature of Man, common to them all: as when the Jewes ſaid of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> that <hi>he loved their nation</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 7. 5.</note>, their meaning was not, either that he loved all that were <hi>Jewes,</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any; nor yet that he loved any particular perſon of them, more then another; but only that he was lovingly diſpoſed towards them, as they were ſuch a particular Nation, as <hi>viz.</hi> Jewes. But that this Interpretation, either falls in (in ſubſtance) with the former, and ſo is already condemn'd with the condemnation thereof; or elſe, with the third and laſt, which (as we ſhall hear preſently) findeth in this Scripture a <hi>Love</hi> in God towards all the individuall Perſons of Man-kinde, without exception of any; or elſe, that it vaniſheth into nothing, and hath no ſubſtance at all in it, may be thus demonſtrated. If by <hi>Man-kinde,</hi> indefinitely conſidered, be neither meant a ſpeciall or determinate number of the perſons of Men (which the former interpretation aſſerteth) nor yet the univerſality, or intire body of Men, conſiſting of all the particular Perſons of men, which either have been, now are, and ſhall be hereafter, (which the third Interpretation avoucheth) then is it only the nature of Man abſtractively conſidened, which we may (with the Schoolemen) call, <hi>Humanitas,</hi> Humanity, or the ſpecificall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, not the perſons of Men, ſome, or all, which <hi>God</hi> preciſely <hi>loved</hi> with that love, out of which <hi>He gave His only begotten Sonne.</hi> If ſo, then it undeniably followes, that Chriſt was given out of as much <hi>Love</hi> to one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Man-kinde, as to another, or (which is the ſame) not out of any love to any at all. For certain it is, that <hi>Humanitas,</hi> or the ſpecificall nature of Man, is not the perſon of any Man. And ſo, according to this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, God ſhould love the <hi>Reprobates,</hi> as much as <hi>the Elect,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>give His only begotten Sonne</hi> [to Death] as well for the one, as the other. Beſides, if it were the humane Nature indefinitely conſidered (in the ſence pre-declared) which God is here ſaid to have <hi>loved,</hi> with that love, out of which <hi>He gave His only begotten Sonne,</hi> from hence alſo it muſt needs follow, in as much as the <hi>Reprobate</hi> (ſo called) partakes every whit as much in this nature, as the Elect, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was given as much for the one, as for the other. Again, if by, <hi>the World,</hi> be meant the humane Nature (in the ſence
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94900:59"/> diſtinguiſhed) the diſtributive Particle, <hi>whoſoever,</hi> with the following words, will be found incongruous, and no wayes anſwering the former part of the <hi>Verſe,</hi> either in ſence, or regularneſſe of conſtruction. For the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is but ſimply one and the ſame nature, or thing, nor doth it containe any Plurality, of Species, or Individuall humane Natures under it; whereas a diſtribution cannot be, but of ſome generall, which containeth many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars under it. And upon the ſuppoſall of ſuch a ſence of the word, <hi>World,</hi> to make the conſtruction Regular in the latter part of the <hi>Verſe,</hi> the tenor of the whole muſt run thus: <hi>So God loved the humane Nature,</hi> that <hi>He gave His only begotten Sonne, that what humane Nature ſoever believed in him, ſhould not periſh,</hi> &amp;c. If this conſtruction be ridiculous, ſo muſt that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation needs be, which produceth it. Laſtly, (to anſwer the illuſtration of this interpretation, from <hi>Luke</hi> 7.) the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who ſaid the <hi>Centurion lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Nation,</hi> did not ſuppoſe, that he loved only a handfull or ſmall number of their Nation, and hated all the reſt with an irreconcileable hatred; nor did they ſay, that he <hi>ſo loved their Nation,</hi> that <hi>whoſoever of this Nation ſhould trust him,</hi> he would be a ſignall Benefactor unto them, or the like: nor did they by, <hi>their Nation,</hi> underſtand the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Race, Lineage, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, abſtractively conſidered, and without reference to any Perſon, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whatſoever, of this <hi>Nation</hi> (for, <hi>their Nation,</hi> in this ſence, was wholly uncapable of any fruit or expreſſion of his love, or of having a <hi>Synagogue built</hi> to it, or for it). So that this inſtance no wayes parallel's or fits the interpretation of the word, <hi>World,</hi> for the illuſtration, or confirmation whereof it is brought. But the plain meaning of the Jewes, ſaying, that <hi>the Centurion loved their Nation,</hi> was this, that he was ready and willing to do any office or ſervice of love to any Perſon, or Perſons of their <hi>Nation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Nationall Relation, rather then to any other (upon ſuch a conſideration) when he had opportunity. The two pretenders being non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited, a ſufficient way (I preſume) is made for the admiſſion of the right heire. <hi>Therefore,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third (and laſt) interpretation of, <hi>the World,</hi> (in the Scripture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> debate) is, that by it is ſignified <hi>Univerſum genus humanum,</hi> the whole compaſſe of Man-kinde, or all and every individuall perſon ſubſiſting at any time in the humane Nature, without exception of any. This expoſition ſtands with the ordinary and beſt-known ſignification of the words, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all gives Smoothneſſe, and Regularity of conſtruction, unto the period or ſentence, which both the former (as upon examination hath been found) take from it: is of perfect accord with the Context: and beſides, magnifies the <hi>Love of God</hi> in the freeneſſe, fulneſſe, and extent of it incomparably above, and beyond, either of them. <hi>For,</hi>

               </gap>, very frequently and familiarly both in the<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> Scriptures themſelves, and in other Authors, ſignifieth the generality of Man-kinde, or of Men: in the Scriptures eſpecially, when it relates unto perſons, it ſeldome or never ſignifieth any thing elſe, but either the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men ſimply and abſolutely, or elſe that generality of Men, which comparatively comprehendeth <hi>all Men,</hi> I meane, the whole number of wicked and unregenerate Men, who in reſpect of their vaſt multitudes, and inconſiderable number of the godly (in compariſon of them) are by <hi>John</hi> termed, <hi>the whole World; And we know that we are of God, and</hi> THE WHOLE WORLD <hi>lieth in wickedneſſe</hi>

Severall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were lately given of the ſecond ſignification of the word, from the Scriptures. Inſtances of the firſt ſignification alſo there are many. <hi>Yee are the light of the World</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 5. 14.</note>. <hi>And the World knew Him not</hi>

               <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 10</note>. The word being never uſed in the Scripture for the Elect or godly party in the World, conſidered by themſelves, or apart from others, but either for the wicked of the World alone, or apart by themſelves, or elſe for both godly and wicked taken together; and as mixed, one with another, it were very ſtrange that our Saviour ſhould uſe it in that <hi>by-ſence,</hi> (and unheard of elſe-where) in ſo eminent a place and paſſage of the Goſpell, as that in hand, and nor in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and beſt known ſignification of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This interpretation of the word, accommodates the whole Verſe, or<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> Sentence, with cleerneſſe of ſence, and regularneſſe of conſtruction, as is evident unto thoſe, who underſtand what the one, and what the other of theſe meane. For by it the Genuine and Proper uſe and import of the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Particle, <hi>whoſoever,</hi> is fully ſalved, (which is deſtroyed by either of the former,) and ſuch a diſtribution of a generall made by it, which ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a poſſibility of a difference between the Particulars contained under it, and into which the ſaid generall is diſtributed, according to the exigency of thoſe things, in Reference whereunto the diſtribution is made. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: here is a diſtribution made of this generall, <hi>the World [i. e.</hi> of all Mankinde] by this diſtributive Pronoune, <hi>whoſoever:</hi> the occaſion of this diſtribution is to ſhew, who, or what particulars contained under this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <hi>i. e.</hi> what particular Perſons of Man-kinde, ſhall <hi>not periſh, but have everlaſting life;</hi> and withall, by a tacit antitheſis, or in a conſequentiall way (as hath been already noted) to ſhew, what other particulars contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the ſame generall, ſhall <hi>periſh,</hi> and not <hi>have everlaſting life.</hi> The former, are ſaid to be ſuch, as ſhall <hi>believe on the only begotten Sonne of God:</hi> the latter are cleerly implied to be ſuch, who ſhall not ſo <hi>believe.</hi> Now if it ſhould be ſuppoſed, that there was, or is, no poſſibility that any ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhould be found between the Particulars, into which the generall is here diſtributed, as <hi>believing,</hi> and not <hi>believing,</hi> the diſtribution would be altogether needleſſe, and vaine; yea and would diſ-ſence the whole ſentence. Theſe things are plaine and ſenſible to every underſtanding, that knows what belongs to common ſence, or regularity of Syntaxis.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This expoſition of the word, <hi>World,</hi> makes a cleane joynt, a rationall<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> and pleaſant coherence, between this Verſe, and that which followes; as alſo betweene this, and the two Verſes immediately precedent. The words of the two preceding Verſes, are theſe: <hi>And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſse, even ſo muſt the Sonne of Man be lifted up; that whoſoever believeth in Him ſhould not periſh but have everlasting life.</hi> Now certaine it is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not <hi>lift up the Serpent,</hi> with an intent of healing to be conferr'd by it upon ſuch, or ſuch, a definite or determinate number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; nor with an intent, either on his part, or on Gods Part, that none ſhould looke upon it, but only ſuch a parcell, or determinate number of Men; but with an intent, not only that whoſoever in the event did <hi>looke upon
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94900:60"/> it,</hi> and could not but <hi>looke upon it,</hi> might <hi>looke upon it;</hi> but that <hi>whoſoever</hi> would, might look up unto it, and that whoſoever, being ſtung with the fiery Serpents, did look up unto it, ſhould be healed thereby. This is evident from the ſtory. <hi>Make thee</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Moſes) a fiery Serpent, and ſet it upon a Pole: and it ſhall come to paſſe, that</hi> EVERY ONE THAT IS BITTEN, <hi>when He looketh upon it, ſhall live</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Numb 21. 8</note>. Now then, all Men without exception being ſtung with that <hi>fiery Serpent,</hi> ſin, unleſſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be lift up [upon the Croſſe] with an intent on Gods Part, and in Himſelf, 1. That every Man, without exception, might believe in Him, and 2. That every Man that ſhould believe in Him, ſhould be ſaved by Him, He could not be ſaid to be <hi>lifted up, as [i. e.</hi> upon the ſame terms of an Univerſall accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, on which] <hi>Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſſe.</hi> Therefore our Saviour, to give the World a ſatisfying account how it comes to paſſe, <hi>that the Son of Man</hi> [meaning, himſelf] ſhould <hi>be lifted up</hi> upon ſuch terms [<hi>viz.</hi> for the Univerſall benefit of Salvation unto all Man-kind] he aſſigns the <hi>Love of God to the World,</hi> as the reaſon or productive cauſe of it. <hi>For God ſo loved the World, that, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore by, <hi>the World,</hi> he muſt needs mean all Man-kinde, or the generality of Men, that were bitten, or ſtung with ſin; unleſſe we will ſay, that <hi>God gave His Son</hi> for the Salvation of thoſe, whom He <hi>loved</hi> not.</p>
            <p>The tenor of the following Verſe is this. <hi>For God ſent not His Sonne into</hi>

               <hi>the World, to condemn the World, but &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words, our Saviour confirms his former Aſſertion, touching the <hi>love of God to the World,</hi> in <hi>giving His Sonne</hi> for the Salvation of it, by rejecting that Reaſon or Motive, of his <hi>ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Him <hi>into the World,</hi> which Men might imagine did occaſion this His <hi>ſending</hi> by God, and beſides which, there could none other well be imagined, but only that which he had aſſerted; <hi>viz.</hi> an Intent or Purpoſe in Him [in God] of <hi>condemning the World</hi> by Him. Now to make <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſay, that <hi>God ſent not His Sonne into the World,</hi> to <hi>condemn</hi> Man-kinde, or the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men, as having ſinned againſt Him, is to make Him ſay that which is ſavoury, and comfortable, and that which oppoſeth, or is apt to prevent, ſuch a ſad imagination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as was very incident to the minds of Men through a conſciouſneſſe of the guilt of ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> That if God ever did, or ſhould, ſend His Son amongſt them, it would be to judge, or condemn them. But to make Him ſay, <hi>that God ſent not His Sonne into the World to condemn</hi> the Elect, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe few whom He infinitely loved, and to whom He had peremptorily, and without all poſſibility of reverſe, decreed non-condemnation, before this <hi>ſending</hi> of Him, is to make Him ſpeak at an extreme low rate of Sence or Reaſon, and to labour (as the Proverb is) in lifting a feather; in as much as no ſuch thought or imagination as this was ever like to beare upon, or trouble any mans ſpirit. In as much then as no other interpretation of, <hi>the World,</hi> in the former Verſe, but only that, which hereby underſtandeth the generality of Men-ſinners, will accommodate this Verſe, in reſpect of the connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, with any tolerable ſence, evident it is, that that muſt needs be the true interpretation thereof.</p>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94900:60"/> diſcover to their ſhame, the ſpirituall blindneſs and ignorance in ſuch Men, who being ignorant preſume of their knowledge, by one means or other; but with an intent to heale the <hi>blindneſse</hi> of all, to their Comfort, Peace, and Glory. Therefore if any man through a fooliſh and proud conceit of his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and wiſdom, ſhall ſtumble at, or reject the Goſpell and Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>fooliſhneſſe,</hi> and ſo diſcover himſelf to be blind, ignorant, and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, in the end; this is meerly adventitious and accidentall, in reſpect of the Antecedent, Primary, and direct intention of God, in ſending <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the World, as <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf affirmeth <note n="a" place="margin">Quod autem alibi docet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, ſe in judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium veniſſe, quod vocatur Petra ſcandali, quod dicitur po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitus in multo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ruinam, id accidentale eſt, vel (ut ita lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quar) adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.

            <p>The Scripture laſt opened, ſpeaking ſo plainely and fully (as we have<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> heard) the point in hand, might well be accepted as a ſufficient ſecurity, that all its fellowes mentioned with it, as (in effect) they ſpeak, ſo likewiſe they intend and meane, the ſame thing. Yet becauſe prejudice is froward, and hard of ſatisfaction, let us unpartially examine one or two more of the company; we ſhall finde Univerſall Attonement, as well at the bottome, as at the top, as well in the heart, as in the face, of them. The former of the two, ſhall be that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul; To wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of Reconciliation</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note>. That by <hi>the World,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> is here ſaid to have <hi>been in Christ Reconciling unto Himſelf,</hi> cannot be meant the Elect only, but the univerſality of Men, is cleer upon this account.

Secondly, by the <hi>Reconciling the World unto Himſelf, in,</hi> or through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is here aſcribed unto <hi>God,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be meant, either ſuch an act or endeavour in him, by which he gaines, or rather ſeeks and attempts to gaine, the love and friendſhip of <hi>the World,</hi> which was, and is, full of hatred and enmity againſt him; or elſe, ſuch an act, by which he went about to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile Himſelf, i. e.</hi> to render and make Himſelf Propitious, and Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous unto <hi>the World.

               <note n="b" place="margin">Mar. 16. 15.</note>. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> did but keep to his Commiſſion, when (as he ſaith) he <hi>Preached Chriſt, warning</hi> EVERY <hi>Man, and teaching</hi> EVERY
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94900:63"/> 
               <hi>Man in all wiſdome, that he might preſent</hi> EVERY <hi>Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Coloſ. 1. 28.</note>. And 2. Evident it is, that in the Miniſtry and Preaching of this word, God doth as well, and as much, and after the ſame manner, perſwade the obſtinate, and many of thoſe who never come to believe, as he doth thoſe who are overcome, and Perſwaded hereunto. It is ſaid concerning the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jewes, that <hi>the Lord God of their Fathers ſent to them by his meſſengers, riſing up betimes, and ſending, becauſe he had compaſsion on his People, and on his dwelling place.</hi> And yet it followes: <hi>But they mocked the Meſsengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſ-uſed his Prophets, untill the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his People, till there was no remedy</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Chro. 36. 15, 16.</note>. So that God is every whit as ſerious, as urgent and preſſing in the Miniſtry of his Word and Goſpell, upon thoſe who remaine obdurate and impenitent to the laſt, as he is upon thoſe, who in time come to repent, and to believe on him. And <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17. Preached the ſame Sermon, uſed the ſame addreſſement and application of the word, to thoſe who <hi>mocked,</hi> which he did to thoſe who <hi>believed</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 17. 32. 34.</note>. Evident therefore it is, that God as well ſeekes and attempts the <hi>Reconciling</hi> of ſuch <hi>unto Himſelf, by Chriſt,</hi> who <hi>in fine</hi> Periſh, as well as he doth thoſe, who are ſaved. And that he doth vouchſafe as well the ſame inward, as outward means, at leaſt remotely, unto both, ſhall be Proved in due place.</p>
            <p>Again, 2. If we ſhall take the latter ſence of the Phraſe, wherein <hi>God</hi> is<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> ſaid <hi>to be Reconciling the world unto Himſelf,</hi> and underſtand hereby ſuch an act, whereby He renders or ſeekes to render Himſelf Loving, Gracious, and Propitious unto the World, neither yet can the word, <hi>VVorld,</hi> ſignifie any thing, but the generality or univerſality of Men; or howſoever, not the Elect in Particular. The reaſon is, becauſe God cannot, in any tolerable ſence or conſtruction of words, be ſaid to reconcile Himſelf unto thoſe, with whom is not angry, or offended; or to render Himſelf Loving and Propitious unto thoſe, to whom his love is ſo great already, that by reaſon of it he Peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily reſolves to give unto them abſolutely the greateſt and moſt deſireable of all good things, even no leſſe then eternall life it ſelfe, which includes in it the richeſt and fulleſt injoyment of God Himſelf, whereof the Creature is capable. Now we know this is the Poſture, or Relation, wherein the Elect ſtand before, and unto, God (at leaſt as is generally held and maintained by thoſe, that are contrary minded in the preſent Controverſie) <hi>viz.</hi> as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with whom God is ſo far from being angry or diſpleaſed, that He is pleaſed by abſolute Purpoſe or Decree to confer eternall life upon them. Therefore certainly God cannot be ſaid by any Act whatſoever to <hi>Reconcile Himſelf,</hi> or render Himſelf Propitious unto theſe. But now, by <hi>the VVorld,</hi> underſtand the great bulk or body of Men in the World, with whom God is, and may truly and properly enough be ſaid to be diſpleaſed for their ſins, ſo he may be ſaid to <hi>Reconcile Himſelf</hi> unto them; at leaſt if by a <hi>Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> we meane ſuch an act, by which He takes a courſe, or uſeth meanes, to bring Himſelf into a complacency, or love of friendſhip with them, as when a Father uſeth meanes to recover his ſon of the Phrenſie, or Plague. It is true, a Father loves his ſon with a benevolous affection, or with a love of pity (as we commonly call it) even whileſt he is under a Phrenſie, and hath the Plague upon him: but he takes no pleaſure in his company, doth not delight to converſe with him, as with a friend; beſtowes nothing upon him at the preſent, but only in order to his recovery; and in caſe by all that he doth for him in this kinde, he cannot recover him, he never proceeds to ſettle his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance upon him. But when, and whileſt, he doth that, which is proper
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94900:63"/> to recover him out of ſuch diſtempers, he may be ſaid (in this ſence) to do an act whereby to <hi>Reconcile Himſelf</hi> to his Son; <hi>viz.</hi> to make way for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to take pleaſure in his company, and to converſe with him, and to deale furthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by him, as a Friend. In like manner it is as true, that God cannot properly, or according to the uſuall ſence or ſignification of the word, be ſaid to doe any act, whereby to <hi>Reconcile Himſelf to the World</hi> in generall (much leſſe to his Elect, in Particular) becauſe he alwayes bares a benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous affection to it (as appeares, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. the Scripture lately opened; So again, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4. and elſewhere) he was never ſo far angry or offended with it, but that he ſeriouſly and affectionately ſought the good of it; yet in ſuch a ſence, or conſideration, wherein, notwithſtanding his affection of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence or commiſeration towards it, he is ſaid to be angry with Men for their ſins, and to hate them for their wickedneſſe, and to reſolve to deſtroy them everlaſtingly, if they repent not, he may be ſaid to doe ſuch an act, whereby to reconcile Himſelf unto it, as <hi>viz.</hi> when he doth that, by which he is like to take Men off from their ſins, and to bring them to Repentance: and conſequently to cauſe his own anger and hatred towards them for their ſins, to ceaſe. But however, this is not the Primary or direct ſence of the Phraſe in the Scripture in hand (as was formerly intimated) but only that which followes upon it. For God by ſeeking to <hi>Reconcile the World unto Himſelf</hi> in the former ſence, takes a courſe likewiſe to <hi>Reconcile Himſelf unto</hi> it, in the latter. But take either the one interpretation, or the other, there is no Colour or Pretence, by the <hi>VVorld,</hi> to underſtand the Elect only.</p>
            <p>If it be objected and ſaid; yea but <hi>God</hi> is here ſaid to <hi>be in Christ Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 31.</note> 
               <hi>the World unto Himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſses unto them.</hi> Doth not this imply that God <hi>Reconciles</hi> none <hi>unto Himſelf,</hi> but thoſe only; to whom he doth <hi>not impute their Treſpaſſes,</hi> or ſins? Now it is certaine that God doth impute their ſins unto all Men, his Elect only excepted: Therefore he Reconciles none unto Himſelfe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but theſe only. To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By conceſſion; It is true, God doth actually, and in the event <hi>Reconcile</hi> none <hi>unto Himſelf, by Chriſt, i. e.</hi> He brings no Man to Faith and Repentance, but withall he forgives him his ſins; or (which is the ſame) he <hi>imputes</hi> not his <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes unto</hi> him. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of exception, I anſwer further, that it was no part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles intent in this place to ſpeak of any ſpirituall or inward Act of God, by which Particular Men are actually, and <hi>de facto</hi> converted, or <hi>Reconciled</hi> unto Him, and conſequently obtaine forgiveneſſe, or a <hi>non-imputation of their ſinnes;</hi> but only concerning that great and gracious diſpenſation, or act of Grace, together with his Counſell or Project therein, in which, or whereby He did (as it were) poſture Himſelf, and take a ſtanding with the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to ſave the World. For this end and purpoſe, I meane, for the ſaving of the World, or of Men, upon ſuch terms as he was willing, and as only became Him, to ſave them, it was neceſſary, 1. That He ſhould <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them unto Himſelf.</hi> It was no wayes convenient for God, as neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting with His Wiſdom, or Holineſſe, to take thoſe into part and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Himſelf in His own Bleſſedneſſe and Glory, who ſhould hate Him, and be full of enmity and hard thoughts againſt Him, and would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of terms of a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with Him. 2. To effect this Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and to bring Men over unto Him in love, who generally through a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94900:64"/> conſciouſneſſe of guilt, contracted by their evill workes, and becauſe of that contrariety between His holy Lawes, and their luſts and vile diſpoſitions, hated Him, it was neceſſary that He ſhould take a courſe, and have a meanes ſuiteable and proper, and which every wayes became a God of infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Now this courſe, or means, the Apoſtle here expreſſeth to be, <hi>the non-imputation</hi> of their ſins unto them: <hi>i. e.</hi> The tender, Offer, or Promiſe of the forgiveneſſe of all their ſins, upon their Reconcilement. God by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall and tender of ſuch an incomparable Grace, Favour, and Bleſſing as this unto Men, upon ſuch ſweet and gracious terms, makes account to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the World unto Himſelf,</hi> to bring off His Creature, Man, from their hatred and hard thoughts, to a love and honourable eſteeme of Him. 3. (And laſtly) to put Himſelf into a way, or capacity, of making ſo rich and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Propoſall, as this of forgiveneſſe of ſins, unto the World, He put Himſelf (as it were) into His <hi>Chriſt;</hi> or (as our Apoſtles expreſſion is) <hi>he was in Chriſt;</hi> meaning, that that which God did, or intended to doe by His <hi>being in Chriſt,</hi> as Mediator, was, <hi>immediately,</hi> and in reference unto a further end, that by meanes of His Death, he might offer free Pardon and Forgiveneſſe of ſins unto the World; <hi>mediately,</hi> and as more Principally intended, that He might, by meanes of this offer, <hi>Reconcile the World unto Himſelf: i. e.</hi> Prevaile with Men to repent of their ſins, and turne in faith and love unto Him. Evident it is from the very letter of the Context, that the Apoſtles intent in this Scripture, was only to expreſſe and declare the tenor or Purport of the Goſpell, or (as He calls it) of that <hi>Word of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Miniſtry</hi> whereof He ſaith (in the end of the Verſe) <hi>was committed unto Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Doe but reade in the former Verſe to this, and you will cleerly ſee it: <hi>And all things are of GOD, who hath Reconciled us to Himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given unto us the Miniſtry of the Reconciliation; To wit,</hi> that <hi>GOD was in Chriſt Reconciling, &amp;c.</hi> As if He ſhould ſay, He hath given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us <hi>the Miniſtry of that Reconciliation,</hi> the tenor, ſubſtance, or purport whereof is this, <hi>viz.</hi> or <hi>to wit, that GOD was in Chriſt Reconciling,</hi> &amp;c. So that here is nothing at all affirmed, or intended to be ſpoken concerning men actually or effectually Reconciled, or brought home unto God, or what their Priviledges are, in one kinde or other; but only to ſhew, how, or by what meanes God hath projected or contrived the <hi>Reconciling of Men to Himſelf,</hi> which is expreſſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A third Text of that ſquadron of Scriptures yet in hand, and the laſt<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> (of this Character) that we ſhall inſiſt upon, is that mentioned from, 1 Joh. 2. 2. <hi>And he is the propitiation for our ſinnes: and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole World.</hi> Some, to keep the light of that Truth, which we have now under aſſertion, from ſhining out of this Scripture, in their eyes, and in the eyes of others, have eſſayed (amongſt them) a threefold deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſence and import of theſe words, <hi>the whole World.</hi> By the <hi>whole World</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>John</hi> meanes, the Elect living in all parts of the <hi>World:</hi> Others, Men of all ſorts and conditions; others, Jewes and Gentiles. Some, to avoid the like danger, (I meane, of being convinc'd of the Truth) and ſuſpecting (as they have cauſe enough) the ſecurity of thoſe interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, take ſanctuary under the wing of this diſtinction, <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſay they) is <hi>a propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole World,</hi> i. e. of all Men in the <hi>World,</hi> in point of ſufficiency, but not by way of intention, on Gods Part. Yet let us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the honor of a triall to the three Interpretations mentioned.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, which, by the <hi>whole VVorld,</hi> underſtands, only the <hi>Elect,</hi> this<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> hath been reſolved into ſmoke already, <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. 10, 11. &amp;c. of this Chapter: where, if the Reader pleaſe to look back, he may ſee it ſmoking ſtill. The other two being confederate with it, (for both the one, and the other are the ſame, in ſubſtance of matter, with it, and differ only in terms of explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) muſt needs fall with it. For both they, who by <hi>the whole VVorld</hi> (in the Scripture in hand) underſtand, Men of all ſorts and conditions, by theſe Men (of all ſorts and conditions) underſtand the Elect only: and they alſo, who interpret, <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> underſtand no other, either <hi>Jewes,</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> but the Elect only. So that all the three interpretations, are interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, but one and the ſame. And therefore, as in caſe <hi>Abrahams</hi> Son by <hi>Sarah</hi> had been ſacrificed, <hi>Iſaac</hi> could not have eſcaped; no more can any one of the three Interpretations mentioned ſtand, if any one of them fall, there being but one and the ſame faint ſpirit of life in them all.</p>
            <p>That which their Reſpective Aſſertors plead for their legitimacy, is of no<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> value at all. For their Plea is, that the word, <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>whole World,</hi> do in ſeverall other places, ſignifie, ſometimes, the Elect only; ſometimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men of all ſorts, ranks, and conditions; ſometimes likewiſe, <hi>Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:94900:65"/> and hereupon they conclude, that they may admit of the ſame ſence and ſignification, both in the Scripture in hand, and in all the other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures uſually brought upon the Theater of Diſcourſe, for the ſame end and purpoſe with it. But the mouth of this Plea is eaſily ſtopped. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. The determinate ſignification of a word in one place, is no argument of the ſame ſence or ſignification of it in another place. <hi>Elohim, Gen.</hi> 1. 1. ſignifieth him, who is by nature <gap reason="foreign">

Nay in one and the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod or ſentence, where the ſame word is twice uſed, it doth not follow, that becauſe it is uſed, and muſt neceſſarily be taken in ſuch, or ſuch a ſence (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately) in one of the places, therefore it muſt be taken in the ſame ſence likewiſe in the other. As for example, where <hi>Christ</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Scribe, Let the dead bury their dead (Mat.</hi> 8. 22.) becauſe in the firſt place, by <hi>dead,</hi> are meant perſons, ſpiritually <hi>dead,</hi> or <hi>dead in ſinnes and treſpaſses,</hi> it no wayes followes from hence, that therefore it ſignifieth ſuch as are ſpiritually <hi>dead,</hi> in the latter place. So likewiſe in that paſſage of our Saviour; <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever drinketh of this water, ſhall thirſt againe; but whoſoever drinketh of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt,</hi>

Therefore to heape up a multitude of quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from the Scriptures, wherein the word, <hi>World,</hi> or the <hi>whole World,</hi> doth, or may ſignifie, either a certaine ſpecies, or determinate kinde of perſons living up and down the World, or, Men of all ſorts and conditions, or <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and from, either an Evidence, or Poſſibility, of any, or all of theſe ſignifications in theſe places, to infer either a Neceſſity, or Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of a like ſignification of the words, either in the Scripture in hand, or in thoſe other places argued in this Chapter, is but to beate the Aire, or build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sand.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the ſaid words, either may be taken, or neceſſarily muſt be taken,<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> (in the places ſo multiplied) in any of the ſaid ſignifications, it is a ſigne, that there is a ſufficient ground of reaſon in the Contexts, reſpectively, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force either the Neceſſity, or Poſſibility of ſuch ſignifications. Now then to infer, or ſuppoſe, either a like Neceſſity, or Poſſibility of the ſame ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, where there is no ſufficient ground in the Context to inforce either (which is the caſe in hand) but many ſufficient grounds to overthrow ſuch ſignifications (as hath been in part already, and ſhall, God aſſiſting, be out of hand further manifeſted, as concerning the Texts inſiſted upon, in this, and the following Chapter) is as if I ſhould prove that ſuch or ſuch a Man muſt needs be a Priſoner at <hi>London,</hi> becauſe he is a Priſoner in <hi>Yorke;</hi> or that he hath the liberty of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> becauſe he may walke where he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth within the Liberties of <hi>Yorke</hi> Caſtle. The ſignification of words in one place, is not to be adjudged by their ſignification in another, unleſſe both the Contexts ſtand uniformly, and impartially affected towards this ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:94900:65"/>3. That neither of the two Texts already opened, will at any hand endure<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> any of the three ſignifications of the word, <hi>World,</hi> lately mentioned, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto, hath been argued into the cleereſt evidence. That the Text in hand no whit better comports with any of them, then they, appeareth thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. If any of the ſaid three ſignifications of <hi>the whole World,</hi> ſhould be here admitted, the Apoſtle (or rather the Holy Ghoſt by the Apoſtle) muſt be ſuppoſed to ſpeak after no better rate of reaſon, then this; <hi>Chriſt is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation not for our ſinnes only, but alſo for the ſinnes</hi> of ſome few particular Men beſides, whom you know not; or, of ſome few Perſons, as well of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> For none of the three interpretations amounts to any thing more then this, as is evident. They who interpret, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>propitiation for the ſinnes</hi> of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> doe not meane the two great diviſions of Men in the World commonly diſtinguiſhed by theſe Names, in all the Particulars of either diviſion, (for this is the fence and interpretation which we contend for) but that ſmall, and (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively) inconſiderable remnant of both, who in concluſion come to be actually ſaved. There is the ſame conſideration of the two other interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Now what weight, or worth of Notion, or ſavour of ſence there ſhould be, in informing the Chriſtians here written unto, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>propitiation</hi> for ſome few Mens ſins beſides theirs, or as well as theirs, I yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The naturall and plaine inclination of the Context, leads to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> and ſence of, <hi>the whole World,</hi> contended for. For the Apoſtle doth not ſimply ſay, that <hi>Chriſt is the propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole World,</hi> but he ſaith it by way of an emphaticall antitheſis, or addition, to this ſaying, that He was <hi>the propitiation for their ſinnes. And he is the propitiation for our ſinnes: and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole World.</hi> This laſt Clauſe, <hi>but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole World,</hi> is cleerly added by way of augmentation or further ſtrengthning to the ground of their Faith, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Now evident it is, that there will be little or nothing found in it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any ſuch end, as the further enlargement of their comfort, or ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to their Faith, above what the former Clauſe preſented, but rather, that which will be prejudiciall and inſnaring unto both, unleſſe theſe words, <hi>of the whole World,</hi> be taken in their comprehenſive ſignification; I mean for all Men in the World (without exception.) For to ſay thus unto a Believer, or to a Profeſſor of the Faith of Chriſt, who is doubtfull about the grounds of his Faith, and but weake in the comfort of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> (which was apparantly the condition of thoſe, to whom <hi>Iohn</hi> Writes this Epiſtle, and in conſideration whereof, that very Clauſe we now ſpeak of, was added to the former) <hi>Chriſt is the propitiation for the ſinnes</hi> of the Elect, or of ſome few particular Men, muſt needs rather add to their doubtings, then their Faith, and augment their feares, rather then their comforts; yea and would take from, rather then add to, that ground of conſolation, which He had adminiſtred in the former Clauſe; <hi>And He is the Propitiation for our ſinnes.</hi> For when I am in ſuſpence, and doubtfull in my ſpirit, whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for me, or be a <hi>propitiation for my ſinnes,</hi> or no, how ſhould it any wayes tend or conduce to my eſtabliſhment, for me to know, or conſider, that Chriſt died for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or for ſome particular Men, both of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and for ſome only? Hath not ſuch a Doctrine, or conſideration as this, fuell in it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the burnings of my feares within me, inſtead of water to quench, or
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94900:66"/> allay them? Or can I be ever a whit the more ſtrengthened to believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for me, by believing, that He died for ſome Particular Men? or muſt not my feares in this kinde, I meane, whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for me, or no, needs be the more provoked and enraged within me, by conſidering, that <hi>Christ</hi> died for ſome few Particular Men only? Or doth ſuch an aſſertion as this, that <hi>Christ died</hi> for ſome Particular Men, though never ſo ſubſtantially proved, though never ſo effectually believed, any wayes enable, or diſpoſe me to believe, that I am one of thoſe Particular Men, for whom he died? Nay rather muſt not a rumination or feeding upon ſuch a Notion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception as that, falling in conjunction with the weakneſſe and doubtfulneſſe of my Faith, together with the ſence and conſcience of my many corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and infirmities otherwiſe, of neceſſity involve and perplex me with ſo much the more grievous and inextricable fears, that I am none of thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men, none of thoſe few, for whom alone <hi>Chriſt</hi> died? Therefore any of thoſe reſtrained interpretations of, <hi>the whole VVorld,</hi> which we have oppoſed, do moſt manifeſtly oppoſe the plaine ſcope and drift of the Holy Ghoſt, which was (as hath been proved) the ſtrengthening or incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Faith, upon rich and excellent terms: whereas the true interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the words, and that which we plead, hath the faireſt and fulleſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance with ſuch an intent, which can lightly be imagined. For the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that <hi>Christ</hi> by his death became a <hi>propitiation,</hi> or made a full attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>for the ſinnes</hi> of all Men, without exception, as it tends to magnifie <hi>the unſearchable riches of the Grace of Christ,</hi> on the one hand, and ſo is proper to ſtrengthen the hand of every Mans Faith; ſo on the other hand, it <hi>throws down every Mountaine, and fills every Valley,</hi> removes all obſtructions, takes away all impediments, cleers all ſcruples, and ſo prepares a plain and ſmooth way for every Man to come unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> by believing; yea and cuts off all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>How it comes to paſſe, and how it may well ſtand with the juſtice of God, that, notwithſtanding the Death of <hi>Christ</hi> for the ſins of all Men, yet all Men are not ſaved, ſhall be taken into conſideration in due Time, and Place.</p>
            <p>Concerning the diſtinction mentioned, of <hi>Chriſts</hi> dying <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for all<note place="margin">§. 39.</note> Men, but not efficaciouſly, or <hi>intentionally,</hi> (on Gods Part) as it was firſt hammered out by workmen of no great credit with us for ſpirituall building (the Schoolemen I meane) ſo is it built upon a falſe foundation or ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>intentions</hi> are attributable unto God upon the ſame terms<note place="margin">See alſo <hi>Cap. 7. Sect.</hi> 5. And <hi>cap. 8. 33.</hi>
               </note> in every reſpect, wherein they are competible unto Men; the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath been undeniably proved, <hi>Cap. 3. Sect.</hi> 7, 8. &amp;c. where likewiſe it was particularly argued and made good, that God is, and very properly may be, ſaid to <hi>intend,</hi> whatſoever He vouchſafeth <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>ſufficient</hi> meanes to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, eſpecially with a command to improve or uſe them accordingly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the thing be effected, or no. So that to affirme and grant, that Chriſt died <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for all Men, and yet deny, that he died <hi>intentionally</hi> for all Men, is to ſpeak contradictions, and to pull down with the left hand, what a Man hath built up with his right. Certainly he that levieth and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a proportion of meanes <hi>ſufficient</hi> and proper for the bringing of any thing to paſſe, muſt needs, in one ſence or other, in one degree or other, be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>intend</hi> the bringing to paſſe of ſuch a thing. Nor is it any diſhonour at all unto God, nor in the leaſt unworthy of him, that he doth not alwayes attaine his ends, or things intended by him; no more then it is, that ſin ſhould
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94900:66"/> be committed in the World, notwithſtanding his oppoſing it by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Law and Threatnings; though in ſtrictneſſe and propriety of ſpeech, it is moſt true, that God never failes of his <hi>intentions</hi> or ends, if by <hi>intentions</hi> and ends we meane only ſuch things, which are abſolutely and poſitively <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> by him. But in this ſence the actuall ſalvation of Particular Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any other conſideration then as believers, is none of his <hi>intentions. So God loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Sonne</hi> [not ſimply or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, that the <hi>World, i. e.</hi> every Man, no nor yet, that any Man] ſhould be ſaved, or <hi>have everlaſting life;</hi> but that <hi>whoſoever believeth</hi> ſhould have it. So that the abſolute and poſitive intentions of God concerning the ſalvation of Men, are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> concerning the ſalvation ſimply of Men, or of any Man, as ſuch, but of <hi>Believers:</hi> and of ſuch <hi>intentions</hi> as theſe he never faileth, or ſuffers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment. But of this, we ſpake liberally in the third Chapter.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if <hi>Christ</hi> died <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for all Men, either God <hi>intended</hi> this<note place="margin">§. 40.</note> 
               <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of his Death, for, or unto, all Men, or not. If not, then was the glory, or ſovereigne worth of this death of his, beſides the <hi>intentions</hi> of God; God did not <hi>intend</hi> any ſuch compleatneſſe of merit or ſatisfaction in his death, as were in it. But this (I preſume) tempteth no Mans thoughts, or belief. If then God did <hi>intend</hi> the ſufficiency of his Death, for, or unto, all Men, why may it not be ſaid, that he <hi>intended</hi> his Death it ſelf accordingly? and ſo, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died <hi>intentionally</hi> (on Gods Part) for all Men? The word, <hi>ſufficiently,</hi> is no <hi>terminus diminuens,</hi> no terme of diminution. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the argument followes roundly: if God <hi>intended</hi> the ſufficiency of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death for all Men, then he <hi>intended</hi> his Death it ſelf for all Men; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died, not <hi>ſufficiently</hi> only, but <hi>intentionally</hi> alſo, for all Men. And ſo the diſtinction vaniſheth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, how can he, who payeth nothing at all for a Man, nor intends to<note place="margin">§. 41.</note> pay any thing, be notwithſtanding ſaid to pay that, which is <hi>ſufficient</hi> for him? Suppoſe a Man be in debt, and in danger of impriſonment for it, can <hi>a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> payment be ſaid to be made for him, whether any thing at all be payed for him, or in order to the keeping of him from impriſonment, or no? when nothing at all is paid for a Man, that is a great Debtor, but that he remaines as much a Debtor, and in as great danger, as before, can that which is <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> or enough for him, or for his diſcharge, be ſaid to be paied for him; unleſſe (haply) it be in a ſence very deluſory and deriding, in which ſence (doubtleſſe) <hi>Christ</hi> did not pay any Ranſome for any man? Suppoſe a man ſhould pay a great ſum of money only for the redeeming of <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> being Captives; by which money, he might, if he had pleaſed, have ranſomed me alſo, and a thouſand more, being in the ſame condition of captivity with them, can this man by reaſon of the payment of ſuch a ſum as this upon the terms ſpecified, be ſaid to have payd that which is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to Ranſome me? Or is that <hi>ſufficient</hi> to Ranſome me, which was only paid for the Ranſome of another?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if there were a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> in the Death of <hi>Christ</hi> for all Men, or<note place="margin">§. 42.</note> for the Salvation of all Men, and God not <hi>intend</hi> it for all Men, but for a few, a number inconſiderable only, then will the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be found rather matter of diſhonour or diſparagement, unto him, than of honour. Suppoſe a Man were poſſeſt of a very great eſtate in Gold, Silver, and other the good things of this life, whereby he is able to relieve the neceſſities of all his Neighbours round about him, who are generally poore, and that to ſuch an extremity, that without relief from him, they muſt inevitably periſh; in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94900:67"/> caſe this Man ſhould reſolve to relieve only two or three of theſe indigent Perſons, with this his abundance, and rather throw the reſt of it into the midſt of the Sea, then miniſter unto any more of them, though they be many thouſands, and theſe every whit as neceſſitous and as well-deſerving as the other; would not this great eſtate, in ſuch a caſe, and upon ſuch terms as theſe, be a blot rather, and reproach, then an honour or matter of repute, to this Man, and declare him to be of a very unnaturall, ignoble, and inhumane ſpirit? In like manner if God ſhall have ſatisfaction, merit, and attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before him abundantly <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſave the whole World from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing everlaſtingly, and ſhall purpoſe rather to let it be <hi>like water ſpilt upon the ground, which cannot be gathered up,</hi> then diſpoſe of it towards the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any more, then only a ſmall handfull of Men (comparatively) leaving innumerable ſoules to periſh irrecoverably, and without mercy; would not this abundance of merit and ſatisfaction upon ſuch an account as this, be, in the eyes of all conſidering men, an obſcuring vail over the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Love, Goodneſſe, and Bounty of God, and occaſion the Creature to judge of him, as a God rather envying, then deſiring, the Peace and Welfare of men? And if God ſo deeply abhorred the fact of <hi>Onan,</hi> in <hi>ſpilling the ſeed upon the ground, lest he ſhould give ſeed unto his</hi> [deceaſed] <hi>Brother,</hi> that he ſlew him for it <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 38 9. 10</note>, how dare men preſent Him ſo neer unto communion in ſuch a fact, as the ſpilling, interverting, or non-conſigning of the far greater part of the merit of the Death of Chriſt unto men, leſt they ſhould be ſaved, would render Him?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, if <hi>Christ</hi> died <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for all men, and not <hi>intentionally,</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 43.</note> not for Reprobates (ſo called) then he died as much for the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as He did for far the greateſt part of men. Becauſe His death, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the intrinſecall value and worth of it, was <hi>ſufficient</hi> to have redeemed the Devils, as well as men. Yea if the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of the Price paid by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be a ſufficient ground to beare ſuch a ſaying as this, that He died <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for all men, He may be ſaid to have died, not only for Reprobates, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates; and ſo for Unbelievers, as Unbelievers [<hi>viz.</hi> ſufficiently] but for the Devils alſo, <hi>quatenus</hi> Devils: in as much as there is no defect imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the price we ſpeak of, in reſpect of the abſolute and inherent dignity, value, or worth of it, but that all theſe, even under the conſiderations men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, might have been redeemed by it, as well as the Elect. But that <hi>Christ</hi> died for Reprobates, as Reprobates, and for Devils, as Devils, in one ſence or other, were never yet (I conceive) the ſayings, or thoughts of any Man; nor (I ſuppoſe) ever will be; certaine I am, cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, (and laſtly) as yet there hath no ſufficient ground been ſhewed,<note place="margin">§. 4. 4</note> either from the Scriptures, or from Principles of Reaſon for the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under Conteſt; nor (I believe) ever will be, or can be. Therefore they who diſtinguiſh between <hi>Chriſts</hi> dying for al men, <hi>ſufficiently,</hi> and <hi>intentionally,</hi> oppoſing the one to the other, affirming the former, and denying the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, do not only go about to ſet Lambs together by the eares, which will not fight, but alſo ſpeak things moſt unworthy of God, and which render him a far greater deluder or derider of his poore Creature, Man, then a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor or well-willer to him, in all his Declarations and Profeſſions of love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in the gift of His Son <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> to make his attonement, and procure Redemption for him.</p>
            <p>Upon conſultation had with the Premiſſes, with other conſiderations
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94900:67"/> (haply) of like import, ſome of the greateſt and moſt learned oppoſers of Univerſall Redemption, <hi>Piſcator,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> by Name, have ſtigmatized the aforeſaid diſtinction (at leaſt that member of it, wherein Chriſt is ſaid to have died ſufficiently for all Men) as harſh, <hi>Barbarous, Homonymous;</hi> yea the former of the two, as abſolutely falſe. <hi>That expreſsion</hi> (ſaith <hi>Beza) Chriſt died for the ſinnes of all Men, ſufficiently, but not efficaciouſly, though in a recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſence it be true, yet is it extreamly harſh, and no leſſe ambiguous then</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous. <hi>For the particle,</hi> FOR, <hi>imports either the Counſell of the Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which Chriſt ſuffered, or elſe the effect it ſelf of his ſufferings, or rather both; whereas neither of them belong to any, but the Elect</hi>

Let the Context adjoyning to this Scripture be narrowly ſifted, and then, if we ſhall but grant that the Apoſtle ſpeaks either Sap, Sence, Savour, or any thing congruous to the judgements or underſtandings of Men, we ſhall not be able to deny but that it carries the Doctrine aſſerted, with an high hand of evidence in it. Evident it is, that the Apoſtle in this Verſe goes on with the confirmation, or further Proof of that Reaſon of his, layd down Verſ. 4. for the making good what he had ſaid, Verſ. 3. That which he had ſaid in this third Verſe is this: <hi>For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of GOD our Saviour. This is good,</hi> meaning, the Performance of that duty, whereunto he had exhorted Verſe 1. and 2. <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Supplications, Prayers, Interceſsion, giving of Thanks, ſhould be made for</hi> ALL <hi>Men; For Kings, and for</hi> ALL <hi>that are in Authority, &amp;c.</hi> Now then moſt evident it is, that by, ALL MEN, (in this firſt Verſe) for whom <hi>Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. are to be <hi>made</hi> unto God, is not meant, ſome of ALL ſorts of Men, nor yet ALL the Elect, or the like, but ALL of ALL ſorts of Men whatſoever (except haply thoſe who have barr'd up the way of our Prayers for them, by that unpardonable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Iohn</hi> intimates <note n="b" place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 16.</note>,) For that which followeth Verſe 2. cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinceth it; <hi>For Kings, and for</hi> ALL <hi>in Authority.</hi> Certainly if this be <hi>good and acceptable in the Sight of GOD,</hi> that we ſhould <hi>Pray</hi> for ALL of one
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94900:68"/> ſort or degree of Men in the World, eſpecially <hi>for</hi> ALL <hi>in Authority</hi> (in which ſort or ranke of Men there are many as unworthy and uncapable of our Prayers, as in any other) <hi>it is good and acceptable in his ſight</hi> likewiſe, that we ſhould <hi>Pray</hi> for ALL in ALL other ranks or ſorts of Men whatſoever. For there is nothing imaginable to cauſe a difference in this Point. So then, to prove that it is <hi>good and acceptable in the Sight of GOD to pray for</hi> ALL <hi>Men</hi> without exception, the Apoſtle layeth down this ground <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. That God <hi>will have</hi> ALL <hi>Men to be ſaved.</hi> If now by ALL <hi>Men</hi> in this Reaſon, we ſhall underſtand only ſome of ALL <hi>ſorts</hi> of Men, or, ALL <hi>the Elect</hi> only, we ſhall ſhorten the arme of the Apoſtles Argument ſo far, that it will not reach half way towards that concluſion, for the proof whereof it is brought, and ſo ſhall make him reaſon very weakly, and (indeed) ridiculouſly, as <hi>viz.</hi> after this manner: <hi>It is good and acceptable in the Sight of GOD</hi> that we ſhould <hi>Pray</hi> univerſally <hi>for</hi> ALL <hi>Men</hi> without exception of any, becauſe God will have all his Elect to be ſaved, or ſome out of every ſort of Men. There is little ſavour of an Argument in this: whereas the rationality and ſtrength of the Apoſtles arguing, rightly underſtood, is pregnant and full of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>It is good and acceptable in the Sight of GOD</hi> that we ſhould <hi>Pray for</hi> ALL <hi>Men</hi> without exception, becauſe his <hi>Will</hi> is to have ALL <hi>Men,</hi> without exception, <hi>ſaved.</hi> The ſtrength of this Argument lieth in this ground, or cleer Principle in Reaſon; <hi>viz.</hi> that a conformity unto his own <hi>Will,</hi> in the will and endeavours of men, is, and muſt needs be, <hi>good and acceptable in the Sight of GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Now then to prove that Gods <hi>Will,</hi> is, that ALL <hi>Men</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception ſhould be <hi>ſaved,</hi> the Apoſtle brings this reaſon (in the words in hand) <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Christ Ieſus gave Himſelf a ranſome for</hi> ALL <hi>Men.</hi> So that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ALL <hi>Men</hi> here, in this reaſon, muſt of neceſſity be of the ſame extent, with the ſame word in the Doctrine or Concluſion, which was to be proved: otherwiſe we ſhall make the Apoſtle ſtumble at that ſtone in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at which only Novices, or Liers-in-waite to deceive, are wont to ſtumble, as <hi>viz.</hi> when there is more put into the Concluſion, then into the Premiſſes. That which here lay upon the Apoſtles hand to prove, was (as hath been undeniably evicted) that Gods Will is to have ALL <hi>Men,</hi> without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ſaved.</hi> Now to prove this by ſuch an argument or aſſertion as this, that <hi>Christ gave Himſelf a ranſome,</hi> either for ALL <hi>his</hi> Elect, or for ſome of ALL ſorts of men, as for ſome as well <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as <hi>Jewes,</hi> and for no others, is as if I ſhould undertake to prove the bountifulneſſe of a Prince towards all his Subjects, being many, by ſuch an argument as this, that he ſent by a ſpeciall ſervant of his very great rewards to two or three of them, but reſolved to doe nothing at all for any more of them. Therefore univerſality of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the moſt unqueſtionable Doctrine of the Apoſtle in this Scripture.</p>
            <p>The next ſpecified in the ſaid Catalogue or Inventory, was; <hi>Becauſe we thus</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> 
               <hi>judge, that if one died for</hi> ALL, <hi>then were</hi> ALL <hi>dead: and that he died for</hi> ALL, <hi>that they who live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him, who died for them, and roſe againe</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14. 15.</note>. We ſee the Apoſtles judgement here is very cleer, that <hi>Chriſt died for</hi> ALL: he once cleerly ſuppoſeth it; <hi>if one died for</hi> ALL. <hi>i. e.</hi> ſince <hi>one died for</hi> ALL (the Particle, <hi>if,</hi> being <hi>racionantis,</hi> not <hi>dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantis,</hi> as in twenty places beſides) meaning, <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and once plainly aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, <hi>and that he died for</hi> ALL; <hi>i. e.</hi> We alſo <hi>judge that he died for</hi> ALL. That which is commonly given in by way of anſwer, to this, and other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both of the former, and latter import, by thoſe who looke another
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94900:68"/> way in the controverſie in hand, is not much conſiderable. But that which it is, is this: they pretend that both the word, <hi>World,</hi> and ſuch terms of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality, as theſe, <hi>All, All Men, every Man,</hi> &amp;c. are in many places of Scripture uſed, and accordingly are to be taken and underſtood, in a reſtrained ſignification; as ſometimes for many, or greater numbers, of Men; ſometimes for <hi>ſome of all ſorts;</hi> ſometimes for <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or the like. From whence they would infer, that therefore ſuch Terms and Expreſſions as theſe, are in the Scripture in hand, and in the others formerly cited for our purpoſe, to be taken in ſome of theſe limited ſignifications; and not in the rigor or extent of what they properly ſignifie, as <hi>viz.</hi> for an abſolute and unlimited univerſality of men. For to this we anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. (By way of Conceſſion) moſt true it is, that theſe Notes or Terms of univerſality, <hi>All, All Men, every Man,</hi> &amp;c. are in many places of Scripture neceſſarily to be taken in ſome ſuch limited and reſtrained ſignification, as is affirmed. But then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I anſwer further (by way of exception) foure things. Firſt, that nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> the terms we ſpeak of, nor any other words or expreſſions in Scripture, are, in any other caſe, or upon any other pretence whatſoever, to be taken out of their proper and beſt known ſignifications, but only when the tenor of the Context, or ſome circumſtance of the place doth neceſſitate and inforce ſuch a conſtruction of them. Now evident it is by what hath been formerly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued upon the Scriptures alledged, that there is no neceſſity at all in reſpect of any the reſpective Contexts, nor of any circumſtance in any of them, to underſtand the ſaid terms of Univerſality any otherwiſe, then in their moſt proper [<hi>i. e.</hi> in their moſt extenſive and comprehenſive] ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
            <p>2. (That which is more then this) we have evidently proved that the very tenor of the ſeverall Contexts, wherein the aforeſaid places are found, doth abſolutely enforce and neceſſitate us unto ſuch a proper and comprehenſive ſignification of the ſaid terms of univerſality, as hath been contended for: ſo that there can be no Reaſonable, Regular, or Grammaticall ſence or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction made of thoſe Places, unleſſe ſuch a ſence of theſe terms be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To reaſon thus; theſe, or theſe Words, or Terms, are to be taken in<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> this, or in that ſence, in ſuch, and ſuch places of Scripture; Therefore they muſt, or they may, be taken in the ſame ſence in ſuch and ſuch other places of Scripture, is to reaſon our ſelves into a thouſand errors and abſurdities. As for example; evident it is that in that Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 16. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Peter ſtood at the doore,</hi> by the word, <hi>doore,</hi> is meant a doore of wood, or ſome ſuch materiall. But would it not be ridiculouſly erroneous to infer from hence, that therefore it is to be taken, or may be taken, in the ſame ſence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 9. where <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am the Doore.</hi> So again: when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt ſent</hi> him <hi>to the Gentiles to open their eyes,</hi> Acts 26. 18. evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that by the word, <hi>eyes,</hi> he means their inward <hi>eyes,</hi> their Minds, Judgements, and Underſtandings: but from hence to conclude, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>David</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the Idols which Men make, have eyes,</hi> (Pſal. 116. 5.) the word, <hi>eyes,</hi> is to be underſtood, or may be underſtood, here alſo in the ſame ſence, is to conclude that which common ſence it ſelf abhorreth. So that the weakneſſe of all ſuch arguings or pleadings as this; the words, <hi>All, All Men, every Man,</hi> are in theſe and theſe places of Scripture, to be taken in a limited ſence, for ſome of <hi>All</hi> ſorts of Men, for <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:94900:69"/> or the like; therefore they are to be taken in the ſame ſence in all others, where they are found, is notorious, and moſt unworthy conſidering men. Though whileſt a man is a Priſoner, he cannot goe whither he deſires, but muſt be content with the narrow bounds of his Priſon; it doth not follow from hence, that therefore when he is diſcharged, and ſet at liberty, he muſt needs continue in his Priſon ſtill, eſpecially when his neceſſary occaſions call him to another place, whither alſo he hath a deſire otherwiſe to goe <note n="*" place="margin">See more upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the preceding Chapter. Sect. 35. 36. and likewiſe Sect. 19 of this.</note>.</p>
            <p>We have, as concerning the former Scripture, evidently proved, that the<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> terms, ALL <hi>Men,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be taken in their moſt proper, free, and unlimited ſignifications: and ſhall (God aſſiſting) demonſtrate the ſame in thoſe yet remaining. Let us (at preſent) becauſe the place in hand is pregnant and full to our purpoſe, evince above all contradiction, that the word, ALL, or ALL <hi>Men,</hi> in it, cannot with the honour of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectualls, be underſtood otherwiſe. <hi>Becauſe we thus judge</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that if one died for</hi> ALL, <hi>then were</hi> ALL <hi>dead: and that he died for</hi> ALL, <hi>that they who live,</hi> &amp;c. Obſerve that clauſe of diſtribution, <hi>that they who live: we judge that Chriſt died for</hi> ALL, <hi>that they who live,</hi> i. e. That all they (without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception) who recover, and are, or ſhall be, delivered from this death by <hi>Christ,</hi> for them, <hi>ſhould not live,</hi> &amp;c. So then, if by the word, <hi>ALL,</hi> or <hi>ALL Men,</hi> for whom the Apoſtle here <hi>judgeth</hi> or concludeth, that <hi>Chriſt died,</hi> we ſhall underſtand the univerſality of the Elect only; <hi>for</hi> ALL <hi>Men, i. e.</hi> for <hi>All</hi> the Elect, and for theſe only, we ſhall grievouſly misfigure the faire face of a worthy ſentence, and render it incongruous and inconſiſtent with all Rules and Principles of Diſcourſe. For then the tenor of it muſt riſe, and run thus: <hi>we judge that Chriſt died for all the Elect,</hi> that all the Elect, who ſhall <hi>live,</hi> and be recovered from death by <hi>Chriſt, ſhould not live,</hi> &amp;c. Doth not the eare of every mans reaſon, yea of common ſence it ſelf, taſte an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couthneſſe and unſavourineſſe of ſound, in ſuch a Texture of words, as this? Yea doth not ſuch a carriage of the place, cleerly imply, that there are, or may be, ſome of the Elect themſelves, who ſhall not <hi>live,</hi> or be reſtored from death by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently ſhall not be bound, upon any ſuch ingagement, <hi>to live unto him?</hi> Doubtleſſe, if by the word, <hi>ALL,</hi> the Apoſtle had meant <hi>ALL</hi> the Elect, and theſe only, he would not have added, <hi>that they who live;</hi> but rather, that they, or theſe, might <hi>live.</hi> For theſe words, that <hi>they who live,</hi> cleerly import a poſſibility at leaſt, yea a futurity alſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> That it would ſo come to paſſe, that ſome of thoſe <hi>ALL,</hi> for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> died, would not <hi>live;</hi> and conſequently would be in no capacity of living from themſelves to live unto him. The uncouthneſſe and ſenceleſſneſſe of ſuch interpretations as theſe, was ſomewhat more at large argued in the next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapter, <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. 13, &amp;c. But now let us take the word; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ALL,</hi> in the proper and due ſignification of it, <hi>viz.</hi> for the generality or univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of men, the ſence will run cleer, and have a ſavoury and ſweet reliſh with it. <hi>Becauſe we thus judge, [i. e.</hi> upon cleer Grounds and Principles of reaſon, argue, and conclude] <hi>that if one died for All Men, then were All Men dead, [i. e.</hi> Obnoxious unto death, dead in Law, as good as dead; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhould not have had any need, that another ſhould <hi>die</hi> for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation] <hi>and that he died for All Men [i. e.</hi> we further alſo <hi>judge,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>that he died for All Men,</hi> with this intent, or for this end, amongſt others] <hi>that they who live [i. e.</hi> That whoſoever of thoſe, for whom he thus <hi>died,</hi> ſhall be ſaved by this death of his for them] <hi>ſhould</hi> [in conſideration
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94900:69"/> of, and by way of ſignall thankfulneſſe for ſuch a Salvation] <hi>not live unto themſelves [i. e.</hi> only or chiefly minde themſelves, whileſt they live in the World, in their carnall and Worldly intereſts] <hi>but unto him, who died for them, and roſe again [<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>i. e.</hi> Promote his intereſt and affaires in the World, who ſo notably ingaged them hereunto by <hi>dying</hi> for them, and by reſuming his Life and Being after his Death, is become capable of their love and ſervice to him in this kinde.] In ſuch a carriage of the place as this, there is <hi>ſpirit and life,</hi> evidence of Reaſon, Commodiouſneſſe of Sence, Regularneſſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, no forcing or ſtraining of Words, or Phraſes, or the like: whereas in any ſuch expoſition, which contracts the ſignification of the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ALL Men,</hi> either to the Elect, or to any leſſer number of Men, then <hi>ALL,</hi> there will be found an univerſall diſturbance in the ſentence, nothing orderly, ſmooth, or clear.</p>
            <p>By the way, the Apoſtle in ſaying that <hi>Christ died for All Men, that they</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 6.</note> 
               <hi>who live, ſhould not live unto themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. doth not intend to confine the duty of thankfulneſſe for <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death, only unto the Saints, or thoſe that are put into an eſtate of Salvation by it, as if wicked Men and Unbelievers ought him no ſervice at all upon that account; but only ſhewes, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> expects or lookes for no ſuch deniall of themſelves for his ſake at the hands of any, but of theirs only, who come actually to taſte and partake of the great benefit and bleſſing of his death. Thus then we ſee, that the word <hi>ALL,</hi> or <hi>ALL Men,</hi> though in ſome place, or places, it may, yea of neceſſity, muſt, ſignifie only ſome men, or ſome parts of all men, yet in others (and particularly in thoſe two lately inſiſted upon) it muſt with the like neceſſity, ſignifie <hi>ALL Men,</hi> without exception.</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) for the word, <hi>World,</hi> which was the terme of contention in the former head of Scriptures, though I deny not, but that in ſome places it ſignifies only ſome part of men in the <hi>World,</hi> and not the intire univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Men, as <hi>Luke 2. 1. Acts</hi> 19. 27. and frequently elſewhere; yet that it any where ſignifies preciſely that part of the World, which the Scripture calls the Elect, I abſolutely deny: neither hath it yet been, nor (I believe) ever will be proved; and the rather, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt delights ſtill (as ſome inſtances have been given <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 5. Sect. 10.</note>, and more might be added without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) to expreſſe that part, or party of men in the <hi>World,</hi> which is contrary unto the Saints, and which are ſtrangers and enemies unto God, by the, <hi>World.</hi> This by way of anſwer to that exception or pretence againſt the expoſition given of the Scriptures alledged; <hi>viz.</hi> that the word <hi>World,</hi> and thoſe generall terms, <hi>ALL,</hi> and <hi>every Man,</hi> are ſometimes uſed in a reſtrained ſignification.</p>

            <p>A third Text of Scripture preſented upon the ſame account with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> was;—<hi>that he by the Grace of God ſhould taſte death, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for every Man</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note>. This clauſe importeth that univerſality of attonement made by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which we maintaine, more ſignificantly (if more may be) and with leſſe liableneſſe to any evaſion, or ſhift, then any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer places ingaged in the warfare. To ſhew that the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though cloathed with a body of fleſh, wherein he was capable of dying, as well as other men, yet did not ſuffer death ſimply through the malice or power of his enemies, but upon an account far ſuperior unto theſe, the Apoſtle attributes his death to the <hi>Grace of God, [i. e.</hi> The love, and gracious affections of God] not towards ſome, or a few, no nor yet towards all men [<hi>collectively</hi> taken, or in the lump] but towards all men <hi>diſtributively</hi> taken, <hi>i. e.</hi> towards every particular and inviduall man. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>for every man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> i. e.</hi> to procure eternall Redemption and Salvation for every man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the excluſion of any. I cannot apprehend what can reaſonably be ſaid to alienate the minde or import of this Scripture from our preſent cauſe. Evident it is (and you ſhall finde our beſt interpreters of the place affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame) that the Apoſtle in theſe words, <hi>that through the Grace of God he might taſte death,</hi> &amp;c. aſſignes a Reaſon, (or two rather) of what he had ſaid a little before, concerning the Incarnation and Humiliation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (whom he had in the former <hi>Chapter</hi> aſſerted to be the Son of God) to prevent, or heal any ſcandall or offence, that either had already, or might afterwards ariſe in the minds of theſe <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> through the unlikelyhood, ſtrangeneſſe, ot incredibleneſſe of ſuch a thing. It is a ſaying among Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, (and all men have experience, in part, of truth in it) that a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Reaſons or Cauſes of things, cauſeth admiration, and ſo all troubleſomeneſſe of thoughts about them, to ceaſe. So then, the Apoſtles drift and intent in the words mentioned, being to ſatisfie the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch a ſtrange, wonderfull, and unheard of a thing, as 1. That the Son of God ſhould be made Man; and 2. That being made Man, he ſhould ſuffer death; it is no wayes credible, but that he ſhould, 1. Aſſigne ſuch a cauſe, as would carry the greateſt weight of ſatisfaction in it; and 2. expreſſe himſelf in ſuch Perſpicuity and Plainneſſe of words, that they might not lightly miſtake his meaning, leſt, if by occaſion of his words, they ſhould firſt apprehend the Reaſon or Cauſe aſſign'd by him, to be more weighty or conſiderable then he intended it, and afterwards ſhould come to underſtand that it was far lighter and leſſe conſiderable, their ſcandall and offence, in ſtead of being healed, or prevented, would be more ſtrengthened and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; as uſually it comes to paſſe in ſuch caſes. Now evident it is, 1. That the Apoſtles words in this place, <hi>that he through the Grace of God ſhould taſte death for every Man,</hi> in the plaineſt, the moſt obvious and direct ſence and ſignification of them, hold forth the Doctrine which we maintaine for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94900:70"/> Truth, here being no reſtraint at all, nor the leaſt whiſpering of any limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be put upon that terme of univerſality, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>every Man;</hi> and 2. As evident it is, that the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for all Men, without the exception of any (which is the Doctrine we aſſert) and the <hi>Grace of God</hi> ſo intending it, amount to a far more weighty conſideration, and ſatisfaction, touching thoſe great diſpenſations ſpoken of, (the Incarnation and Humiliation of the Son of God) then his dying only for a few, or for a ſelect number of men, and the Grace of God commenſureable hereunto. Therefore there is not the leaſt queſtion to be made, but that the large, and not the limited ſence, was the Apoſtles ſence in the words now under debate. And when the Holy Ghoſt expreſſeth himſelf (as we have heard) <hi>that he through the Grace of God ſhould taſte death</hi> FOR EVERY MAN; for any man to come and interpret thus, <hi>for every Man, i. e.</hi> for ſome men, or for a few Men (which, if not for forme, yet for matter and ſubſtance, muſt be their interpretation, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the expoſition given) is not to interpret, but to correct, and to exerciſe a magiſteriall authority over the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>

               </gap>opique argument, that God is not therefore ſaid to <hi>will</hi> that <hi>all Men ſhould be ſaved, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth,</hi> only becauſe he <hi>will have</hi> ſome, ſome few of <hi>all</hi> ſorts of <hi>Men to be ſaved, and come to</hi> this <hi>knowledge:</hi> but ſimply becauſe his <hi>will</hi> is to have <hi>all Men</hi> without exception [<hi>viz.</hi> as they are Men, and whileſt they are yet capable of Repentance] <hi>to be ſaved,</hi> and in order thereunto to <hi>come to the knowledge of the</hi> ſaving <hi>Truth, i. e.</hi> the Goſpell. Nor doth it follow, that the Will of God is changeable, in caſe he ſhould Will the ſame Man, as this day to be ſaved; and as on the morrow to periſh, but only that ſuch a Man is changeable (as we ſhall further ſhew, God willing, in due time.) Now then if it be the <hi>Will of God to have All Men,</hi> without exception, <hi>ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. moſt certaine it is that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died, and that intentionally on Gods Part, <hi>for</hi> ALL <hi>Men,</hi> without exception: becauſe it is not imaginable that God ſhould be <hi>willing to have</hi> thoſe <hi>ſaved,</hi> for whom he was unwilling that Salvation ſhould be procured.</p>
            <p>The latter of the two <hi>Scriptures</hi> lately brought upon the Theatre of our<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> preſent Diſcourſe, acts the ſame part with the former. There it is ſaid of <hi>the Lord (Christ</hi>) that he is not <hi>willing that</hi> ANY <hi>ſhould periſh, but that ALL ſhould come to Repentance.</hi> If ſo, then certainly there neither was, nor is, nor ever ſhall be <hi>any,</hi> for whom <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>not willing,</hi> did not intend, to die, and to purchaſe Repentance.

               </note>) our adverſaries in the cauſe in hand are wont to take Sanctuary from ſuch <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as the two now in debate, under the wing of this Diſtinction. It is true, ſay they, God <hi>Wills that all Men ſhould be ſaved, and ſo that all ſhould come to Repentance, voluntate ſigni,</hi> with his Signified or Revealed Will; but this doth not prove, but that <hi>voluntate beneplaciti,</hi> with the will of his Pleaſure, or Purpoſe, he may be willing that many, even far the greateſt part of men, ſhould periſh. But to ſhew the vanity, or at leaſt the impertinency of this Diſtinction to the buſineſſe in hand;</p>
            <p>1. I would demand of thoſe, who leane upon the <hi>broken Reed</hi> of this<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> diſtinction, in oppoſition to the cleer and direct ſence given of the two <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> laſt mentioned, what they meane by their <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> the ſignified or revealed Will of God; and wherein the oppoſition or difference lieth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94900:71"/> between this, and that other Will of God, which they terme the Will of his good Pleaſure or Purpoſe. If by his <hi>ſignified or revealed Will,</hi> they meane only the Precepts or Commandements of God concerning ſuch and ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which God would have practiſed and done by Men, (which is all the account that ſome of the greateſt Oppoſers in the Point in hand, give of it) I doe not underſtand, how, or in what reſpect God can be ſaid to <hi>will the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all Men,</hi> or that none ſhould periſh. For, 1. <hi>Salvation actively</hi> taken, is an act of God himſelf, not of men: and conſequently cannot be ſaid to be a duty injoyned by him unto men, and therefore not to be <hi>willed</hi> neither by him, by way of <hi>Precept</hi> or Command. 2. Salvation, <hi>Paſsively</hi> taken, is not an act, but a ſtate or condition; and conſequently is no matter of duty; and ſo cannot be ſaid to be <hi>willed</hi> by God, in ſuch a ſence.</p>
            <p>If by the <hi>ſignified or revealed Will</hi> of God (in the diſtinction now under<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> canvaſſe) be meant the Declaration which he hath made in his Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the finall or eventuall Salvation and Condemnation of men, evident it is that neither in this ſence can he be ſaid to <hi>will the Salvation of all Men:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath declared and ſignified unto the World, that <hi>few</hi> (comparatively) <hi>will,</hi> or ſhall, <hi>in fine</hi> be ſaved.</p>
            <p>If it be pleaded, that in this ſence God may be ſaid to <hi>will</hi> the Salvation of <hi>all Men</hi> with his <hi>ſignified or revealed Will,</hi> becauſe he injoynes Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto <hi>all Men,</hi> which are the means of Salvation; and he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes the means, may (in a conſequentiall way) be ſaid to injoyn the end, in the ſame injunction; I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. If God injoynes Faith and Repentance unto <hi>all men,</hi> it argues that he Preacheth the Goſpell unto <hi>All men:</hi> and conſequently that they who have not the letter of the Goſpell Preached unto them by Books, or Men, (as many Heathen Nations have not at this day) yet have the ſpirit, ſubſtance, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Goſpell Preached to them otherwiſe, as <hi>viz.</hi> by the Creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gracious Government of the World, which is (as I have ſhewed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <note n="a" place="margin">Divine Authority of the Scriptures &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 184. 185 &amp;c.

For the Principle or Faculty within me of <hi>willing,</hi> how numerous or different ſoever the acts of <hi>willing,</hi> which I exert by vertue of this faculty, may be, is but one and the ſame. And this faculty being naturall, there can be no ſuch difference between the acts proceeding from it, which ſhould make ſome to be more <hi>proper,</hi> and others, leſſe; though ſome may be better, and others worſe. But this difference can have no place
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94900:72"/> in the acts of the <hi>Will</hi> of God. Therefore if the <hi>precept,</hi> or preceptive <hi>Will</hi> of God, be not <hi>properly</hi> his <hi>Will;</hi> neither can any other <hi>Will</hi> of his, or any other act of his <hi>Will,</hi> be <hi>properly</hi> ſuch. If ſo, then that <hi>Will</hi> of God, or act of <hi>Will</hi> in God, whereby he <hi>Willeth</hi> or injoyneth Faith and Repentance, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, Salvation, unto <hi>All men,</hi> is as <hi>properly</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> as that whereby he <hi>willeth</hi> the Salvation of any Man. Therefore if there be any ſecret or unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed <hi>Will</hi> in God, whereby he <hi>willeth</hi> the deſtruction of any man, at the ſame time when he <hi>willeth</hi> the Salvation of <hi>All men</hi> (be it with what kinde of <hi>Will</hi> ſoever) theſe two <hi>wills</hi> muſt needs enter-feere, and contradict the one the other. Nor will that diſtinction of the late mentioned Author, ſalve a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency between them, wherein he diſtinguiſheth, between the Decree of God, and the thing Decreed by him; affirming, that <hi>the thing which God Decreeth, may be repugnant to, or inconſiſtent with, the thing which he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; though the Decree it ſelf cannot be repugnant to the Command</hi>

               </note>. The vanity of this diſtinction cleerly appeareth upon this common ground; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Acts</hi> are differenced, and diſtinguiſhed by their Objects. Therefore if the Object of Gods decreeing Will, or the thing <hi>Decreed</hi> by him, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the thing preceptively willed, or commanded by him, unpoſſible it is, but that the two acts of his Will, by the one of which he is ſuppoſed to will the one, and by the other, the other, ſhould digladiate, and one fight againſt the other. Therefore certainly there is no ſuch paire, or combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>wills</hi> in God, as the diſtinction of <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> and <hi>beneplaciti,</hi> (as applied in the queſtion in hand) doth ſuppoſe. It is unpoſſible that I ſhould inwardly and ſeriouſly <hi>will,</hi> or deſire, the Death of my child; and yet at the ſame time ſeriouſly alſo <hi>will</hi> and injoyn the Phyſician to doe his beſt to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him.</p>
            <p>Again, if God injoyn Faith and Repentance unto <hi>All men,</hi> with a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> that he injoyneth them in order to their Salvation, or with a promiſe, that upon their obedience to this injunction of His, they ſhall be actually ſaved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then can he not at the ſame time <hi>will,</hi> with a ſecret <hi>will,</hi> the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of any. But moſt evident it is, that unto whomſoever he injoyneth Faith, or Repentance, he injoyneth them in order to their Salvation, and with promiſe of actuall Salvation, upon their obedience to this injunction. <hi>Mar. 16. 16. Acts 3. 19. Joh.</hi> 20. 31. &amp;c. Therefore unpoſſible it is, that he ſhould ſecretly intend, will, or purpoſe the deſtruction of any, to whom he injoyns Faith and Repentance. The conſequence in this argument is ſo rich in evidence, that it needs no Proof. If a Prince ſhould inwardly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly determine to put ſuch or ſuch a Malefactor to death, and yet by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, or otherwiſe, promiſe him his Life, or a Pardon, upon condition he would reform his courſe, would this be a ſtrain of Divine Perfection, or like unto one of the Wayes of God?</p>
            <p>There is a ſence (I confeſſe) wherein the diſtinction now in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> may be admitted. If by the ſignified or revealed Will of God be meant nothing elſe, but ſuch Declarations or Manifeſtations made by God, which when made by men, are ſignes of a Will, Purpoſe, or Deſire in them, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their reſpective tenors and imports, (which is cleerly their ſence of this member of the diſtinction, who were the firſt coyners of it, I mean, the Schoolemen <note n="b" place="margin">Aqu. Sum. Part. 1. Qu. 19 Art. 12. in Cor.</note>) there is no inconvenience in granting a <hi>revealed will</hi> in God, diſtinguiſhed from, or oppoſed unto, a <hi>will of good Pleaſure</hi> or of Purpoſe, in him. This ſence makes no oppoſition of Wills in God, nor yet between things willed or purpoſed by him: but only ſheweth, or ſuppoſeth,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94900:72"/> that the <hi>will and good Pleaſure</hi> in God, extendeth not to the actuall Procurement of obedience from men unto all thoſe Lawes or Commands, which he judgeth meet to impoſe upon them; or (which is the ſame) that God hath not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively decreed that all Men ſhall, or ſhall be neceſſitated by him, to live in ſubjection to all thoſe Lawes, which he hath appointed unto them. This ſence is orthodox, and unblameable: but holds no intelligence with that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which ſuppoſeth one <hi>will</hi> in God, according unto which <hi>he willeth all Men to be ſaved;</hi> and another, according unto which he <hi>willeth</hi> the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of men to be damned, and both antecedent.

But here is no reaſon at all to be given why it ſhould be taken out of the proper and native ſignification, or ſignifie any leſſer number, then <hi>All Men</hi> ſimply. Now to refuſe the proper ſignification of aword, where there is no other reaſon why it ſhould be refuſed, but only becauſe it is to be refuſed where there is a reaſon (and ſo a neceſſity) to refuſe it, is as if one ſhould perſwade a man that is an hungry, to forbeare Meat whileſt he may have it, becauſe he muſt forbeare it, when he cannot get it. When the Context or Subject matter doth require a by, leſſe proper, or limited ſignification of a word or Phraſe, this ſignification is put upon them by God. But when
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94900:73"/> there is no occaſion or neceſſity, either in reſpect of the one, or of the other, why ſuch a ſignification ſhould be put upon them, now if it be done, the do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of it is arbitrary, and from the lawleſſe preſumption of men. How much more when men ſhall do it, not only without any ſufficient ground or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but againſt reaſon? which is the caſe of thoſe, who by [<hi>All men</hi>] in the latter clauſe of the verſe in hand, will needs underſtand only ſome men, and theſe but very few, comparatively. For,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though one and the ſame word, or Phraſe, is ſometimes to be taken<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> in a different ſignification in one and the ſame Period or ſentence (as elſwhere is obſerved) yet this is no where to be done, but where there is a manifeſt and pregnant reaſon for the doing of it, as in theſe and the like places, <hi>Let the</hi> DEAD <hi>bury their</hi> DEAD; <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 22. So again: <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of this</hi> WATER, <hi>ſhall thirst againe: but whoſoever ſhall drinke of the</hi> WATER <hi>that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt more; Joh.</hi> 4. 13, 14. There is a plain reaſon, why by the <hi>dead,</hi> in the end of the former of theſe places, ſhould be meant ſuch as were naturally, or corporally <hi>dead; viz.</hi> becauſe ſuch only are to be <hi>buried,</hi> with that kinde of buriall, whereof our Saviour had occaſion to ſpeak, as appears from the former verſe. Again, why by <hi>the dead</hi> in the beginning of the ſaid paſſage, ſhould be meant thoſe that are <hi>ſpiritually dead,</hi> and not thoſe that are <hi>corporally dead,</hi> there is this reaſon (every whit as plain, as the former) <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe thoſe that are naturally or corporally <hi>dead,</hi> are not capable of burying thoſe that are <hi>dead,</hi> either with one kinde of <hi>buriall,</hi> or other. So why the word, WATER, (in the latter of the paſſages mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſhould in the firſt place ſignifie materiall or elementary <hi>water;</hi> in the latter, ſpirituall <hi>water,</hi> or the Holy Ghoſt; reaſons are obvious and neere at hand: we ſhall not need to name them.

            <p n="3">3. Though, <hi>All men,</hi> doth in ſome places ſignifie only a greater number<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> of Men, not <hi>All men</hi> ſimply or univerſally; yet it never ſignifieth a ſmall number of Men, either in oppoſition to, or in compariſon with, a greater; leaſt of all with the greateſt number that is; as they muſt make it ſignifie in the Scripture in hand, who will have no more ſignified by it (in the latter of the two clauſes, where it is uſed) then only thoſe, who come in time to be actually ſaved by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For theſe are a very ſmall number (<hi>few there be,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt, that finde it;</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>the ſtraite gate,</hi> which leadeth unto Life) in compariſon of thoſe, <hi>upon whom condemnation came by Adam.</hi>

To ſay, that the ſuperabounding of Grace above ſin, here ſpoken of, is to be conſidered in the intenſiveneſſe of it, [<hi>i. e.</hi> in its prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy over ſin, where it is vouchſafed,] not in the extenſiveneſſe of it, as if it extended to more Perſons, is thus far acknowledged for a ſaying of truth; Grace doth not extend to more Perſons, then ſin (at leaſt, not to more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Men) becauſe ſin extendeth unto all, and Grace cannot extend to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94900:74"/> more then all. But if we ſhall ſtraiten and limit Grace, in reſpect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, to a ſmall number of Perſons, as <hi>viz.</hi> unto thoſe only who are, or ſhall be actually ſaved, the glory of the <hi>ſuperabounding of Grace</hi> above ſin, in reſpect of the Prevalency of it, where it is (in ſuch a ſence) given, will be fully match'd, or rather overcome and ſwallowed up, by the prevailing extenſiveneſs of ſin above Grace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Apoſtle, both before, and after (as <hi>viz. Verſe</hi> 15. and <hi>Verſe</hi> 19.)<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> computeth the condemned ones of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the juſtified ones of Chriſt, by one and the ſame numericall expreſſion.

The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> expreſſion <hi>Verſe</hi> 15. is ſomewhat more emphaticall. <hi>For if through the offence of one, many be dead, much more the Grace of God, and the gift by Grace, which is by one Man Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many.</hi> If it ſhall be ſuppoſed that many more millions of Men are <hi>dead through the offence of Adam,</hi> then are <hi>justified</hi> or made alive <hi>by the Grace of God</hi> in Chriſt, <hi>Pauls</hi> glorying over the Grace of God in Chriſt, as <hi>much more abounding to the justification of many,</hi> muſt fall to the ground. For if by the <hi>offence of Adam,</hi> all became <hi>dead;</hi> and a few only be <hi>made alive by the gift of the Grace of God in Christ,</hi> who will not judge, but that the <hi>offence of one much more abounded</hi> to the death of <hi>many,</hi> then <hi>the Grace of GOD</hi> to the Juſtification or Life of <hi>many?</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third ſort, or conſort, of Scriptures, mentioned</hi> Cap. 5. Sect. 5. <hi>as clearely aſſerting the Doctrine hitherto Maintained, Argued, and Managed to the ſame Point.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE ſhall not need (I conceive) to inſiſt upon a Particular examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> of theſe Scriptures, one by one (the Method obſerved by us in handling the two former Partees) becauſe they are more apparantly uniform and conſenting in their reſpective importances, then they. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, a cleer and thorough Diſcuſſion of any one of them, or a diligent Poyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the common tendency and import of them all, will be ſufficient to evince their reſpective compliances with the cauſe in hand. The Proſpect of theſe Texts, is this.—<hi>And him that commeth unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Joh. 6. 37.—HE <hi>that believeth in me, ſhall never thirſt,</hi> Verſe 35. HE <hi>that believeth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mar. 16. 16.—<hi>that</hi> WHOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EVER <hi>believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 3. 16.—<hi>that through his Name,</hi> WHOSOEVER <hi>believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſsion of ſinnes,</hi> Acts 10, 43. <hi>Even the righteouſneſſe of God, which is by Faith of Jeſus Christ,</hi> UNTO ALL, <hi>and</hi> UPON ALL, <hi>who believe; for</hi> ALL <hi>have ſinned, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 3. 22, 23. (to omit very many others of like tenor and import.)</p>
            <p>In all theſe Scriptures, with their fellowes, evident it is that Salvation is<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> held forth and Promiſed by God, unto all, without exception, that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; yea that it is Offered and Promiſed unto all Men upon the condition of believing, whether they believe, or no. So that upon ſuch Declarations of the gracious and good Pleaſure of God towards the univerſality of Men, as theſe, the Miniſters of the Goſpell, or any other Men, may with truth (and ought of duty, upon occaſion) ſay to every Particular Soul of Man under Heaven, <hi>If thou believeſt, thou ſhall be ſaved,</hi> even as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that he <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt, admoniſhing</hi> EVERY MAN, <hi>and teaching</hi> EVERY MAN <hi>in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that he might preſent</hi> EVERY MAN <hi>perfect in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Coloſ. 1. 28.</note>. Yea, this Apoſtle, ſpeaking of God Himſelf, ſaith, that <hi>he admoniſheth</hi> all Men <hi>every where to repent</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 17. 30.</note>. Now if the Goſpell, or God in the Goſpell, offereth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto all Men, without exception, and inſureth it accordingly upon their believing, certainly he hath it to beſtow upon them, in caſe they doe<note place="margin">See more of this <hi>Cap. 8. Sect. 31.</hi>
               </note> believe: otherwiſe he ſhould offer or Promiſe that unto them, which he hath not for them, nor is able to confer upon them, though they ſhould believe. If he hath Salvation for them, or to beſtow upon them, upon their believing, he muſt have it in Chriſt: becauſe he hath no other treaſury or ſtore-houſe of Salvation, but only <hi>Chriſt. Neither is there Salvation in any other,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. If God hath Salvation in <hi>Chriſt</hi> for all Men, <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt needs have Bought and Purchaſed it for them with his Blood, in as much as there is no Salvation, no not in <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf, without, or otherwiſe then by, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins; nor any <hi>Remiſsion of ſinnes,</hi> in or by Him, <hi>without ſhedding of blood.</hi> Therefore all thoſe Scriptures, wherein God Promiſeth and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth Salvation unto all Men (without exception) upon their believing, are Pregnant with this truth, that Chriſt layd down his Life for the Salvation of all, and every Man.</p>
            <p>If it be here replied and ſaid; but though God in the <hi>Goſpell</hi> offers Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> unto all Men, and Promiſeth Salvation unto all Men upon condition
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94900:76"/> of their believing, reſpectively, yet knowing certainly before hand that none will believe, but only ſuch and ſuch by Name, as <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe, for whom there is Salvation Purchaſed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he may upon a ſufficient ground, and with ſecurity enough, Promiſe Salvation unto all men upon condition they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Though God by meanes of the certainty of ſuch his knowledge, may, without danger of failing in Point of Promiſe-keeping, or of being taken at his word to his diſhonour, Promiſe Salvation unto all Men (without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception) upon the terms ſpecified, though it ſhould be ſuppoſed that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not Purchaſed Salvation for all Men; yet upon ſuch a ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this, he cannot, either with honour otherwiſe, or with truth, make any ſuch Offer, or Promiſe. Not with honour; becauſe for a Man, that is generally and certainly known to be worth but only one thouſand Pounds in eſtate, to offer or Promiſe an hundered thouſand Pounds to any Man that ſhall be willing to ſerve him, or to doe ſuch or ſuch a courteſie for him, though he knew certainly that no Man would accept his offer in either of theſe kinds, yet would ſuch an Offer or Promiſe be matter of diſparagement to him in the ſight of wiſe and underſtanding Men, yea render them little other then ridiculous. In like manner, it being ſuppoſed by our Antagoniſts in the cauſe now under Plea, that God hath declared it unto all the World in his <hi>Goſpell,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath died but for a few Men (in compariſon) and conſequently that himſelf hath Salvation only for a few; in caſe he ſhould Promiſe Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto all Men without exception, upon what account, ſervice, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſoever, muſt needs turne to diſhonour in the higheſt unto him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him unto his Creature extremely unlike to himſelfe. Suppoſe the Devill had certainly known (as very poſſibly he might) that the Lord Chriſt would not have fallen down and worſhipped him, upon any terms or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatſoever, would this have excuſed him from vanity, in Promiſing him all the Kingdomes of the World upon ſuch a condition, when as all the world knew that not one of theſe Kingdomes were at his diſpoſall.</p>
            <p>Again, 2. neither can God, nor any Miniſter of the Goſpell, ſay, <hi>with</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> 
               <hi>truth,</hi> to every Particular Man, <hi>if thou believeſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> unleſſe it be ſuppoſed that there is Salvation Purchaſed, or in being, for them all. Becauſe the truth of ſuch an aſſertion cannot be ſalved by this, that all Men, or every Particular Man, will not believe. The truth of a Connex or Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall Propoſition, of which kinde this is, <hi>If thou</hi> Peter, <hi>or thou</hi> John <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> doth not depend upon any thing that is contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, no nor yet upon any thing that is extra-eſſentiall to the terms of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it ſelf (ſuch as is, as well the non-believing, as the believing of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men) but upon the eſſentiall and neceſſary Connexion between the two Parts of the Propoſition, the Antecedent, and conſequent. If this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion be contingent, looſe, or falſe, the Propoſition it ſelf is falſe, though in every other reſpect it ſhould be accommodated to the beſt. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: in this Propoſition, If <hi>Iſaac</hi> were <hi>Abrahams</hi> Son, then was he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly godly; both the Parts, conſidered apart, are true: for true it is, 1. That <hi>Iſaac</hi> was <hi>Abrahams</hi> Son: and 2. That he was truly godly; yet the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is abſolutely falſe; becauſe there is no neceſſary or eſſentiall Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between, being <hi>Abrahams</hi> Son, and true godlineſſe: therefore the one cannot be truly inferr'd, or concluded from the other. In like manner, when I ſhall ſay thus unto a Man, <hi>If thou believeſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> it is neither his non-believing, nor the certainty of my knowledge that he will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94900:76"/> that either maketh, or evinceth ſuch a Propoſition to be true: becauſe neither of theſe relates to the Connexion of the parts thereof, nor containe the leaſt reaſon or ground, why the latter ſhould follow upon the former. The Mans not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> believing, is no reaſon at all, why upon his believing he ſhould certainly be ſaved; no more is my knowledge, how certaine ſoever it be, that he will not believe. But to verifie ſuch a Propoſition or Saying, there muſt be a certaine and indiſſolveable Connexion between ſuch a Mans Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and Believing, in caſe he ſhould believe. Such a Connexion as this there cannot be, unleſſe there were Salvation for him, which he might have and injoy in caſe he ſhould believe. Now certaine it is, that if <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died not for him, there is no more Salvation for him, in caſe he ſhould believe, then there would be, in caſe he ſhould not believe; there being no Salvation for any Man, upon any terms or condition whatſoever, unleſſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath Purchaſed it for him by his Death. Nor doth <hi>Chriſts</hi> Purchaſing Salvation for any Man, depend upon ſuch a Mans believing: no more doth his non-Purchaſing Salvation for him, upon his not-believing. So that unleſſe it be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath Purchaſed Salvation for a Man, whileſt He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines yet an unbeliever, and though He ſhould alwayes remaine an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, it cannot be ſuppoſed that He Purchaſed Salvation for him, though He ſhould believe: and conſequently there can be no truth in this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Aſſertion, ſpoken to a Man who ſhall not believe, <hi>If thou believeſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> it being certaine (upon the aforeſaid ſuppoſition of Chriſts non-dying for him) that he ſhould not, could not, be ſaved, no not though He ſhould believe.</p>
            <p>If it be replied; yea but the truth of this ſaying, to any Man whatſoever,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> 
               <hi>If thou believeſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> is ſufficiently ſalved upon this account, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for all Men, though not <hi>intentionally:</hi> ſo that in caſe any Man whatſoever ſhall, or ſhould, believe, there is Salvation ready for Him in <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that the vanity, or meere nullity rather (in reſpect of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidence of the Members) of this diſtinction, wherein <hi>Christ</hi> is affirmed to have Died <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for all Men, but denied to have Died <hi>intentionally</hi> for all Men, hath been demonſtratively, and at large evinced formerly <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap. 5. Sect.</hi> 39, 40, &amp;c.</note>. I here on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add, that if there be Salvation ready in <hi>Christ</hi> for all and every Man, in caſe they ſhould believe, then muſt this Salvation be found in him, either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and in reſpect of his meere Perſon, or by way of Purchaſe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement, <hi>i. e.</hi> by means of his Death. No Man (I preſume) will affirm the former, as <hi>viz.</hi> that there is Salvation in <hi>Chriſt</hi> for any Man, in reſpect of his meere Nature, or Perſon: or howſoever, Himſelf plainely denies it; <hi>verily, verily, I ſay unto you, except a corne of Wheat fall into the ground, and die, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much Fruit</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 12. 24.</note>. If there be no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Him for Men, but by Purchaſe, and this with his Blood, then hath He no more Salvation in Him, then what He thus Purchaſed: no Man hath any thing more by Purchaſe, then what he hath Bought, or Purchaſed. Therefore if <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath Salvation in Him for all Men without exception, He muſt have Purchaſed, or Bought it for them, with His Blood. If ſo, He muſt either Purchaſe more, then He intended; or elſe intend to Purchaſe Salvation for all and every Man. And what is this, without any Parable, but to die <hi>intentionally</hi> for all Men? Therefore the diſtinction of <hi>Chriſts</hi> dying <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for all men, but not <hi>intentionally,</hi> is ridiculous, and unworthy from firſt to laſt of any intelligent or conſidering Man.</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:94900:77"/>
            <p>Nor is that diſtinction (becauſe it relates to the ſubject matter of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> Chapter) ſo emphatically inſiſted upon by Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> of much better import. <hi>That eternall life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould be offered unto all, and every individuall Man, upon condition of Faith; and that life ſhould be offered unto all and every individual Man, out of an intent on Gods part to give life unto them, in caſe they believe, are two ſayings widely different</hi>

For doubtleſſe the latter hath every whit as much truth in it, yea every whit as much cleare and pregnant Truth in it, as the former; yea hath (in effect) one and the ſame Truth.

If it be ſaid, (in favour of the diſtinction,) but though God <hi>intends</hi> to give eternall Life to all and every individuall man, upon condition they believe (this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expreſſe tenor of His Offer or Promiſe) yet it followes not, that ſuch an <hi>intention</hi> in Him ſhould be His reaſon or ground of tendring ſuch an offer, or Promiſe, unto them; unto this I anſwer, that if this were the <hi>intent</hi> of the Author, I meane to difference the latter propoſition from the former in point of error or falſehood, upon this account, becauſe the latter ſuppoſeth ſuch an <hi>intention</hi> as that mentioned, in God, to be the adequate reaſon or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, why He tenders ſuch an Offer or Promiſe unto them, I ſhould not much gaineſay: becauſe I ſuppoſe that God hath indeed other reaſons, and theſe of greater weight, why He makes a tender of Salvation unto all men upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Faith, then His <hi>intention</hi> of giving Salvation unto them, in caſe they ſhall believe. Yea, I doe not conceive, that either God or men, do any thing which they intend, ſimply out of their intentions thereof, or becauſe they intend it; but out of a deſire to effect, or to procure the effecting of it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſire it.</p>
            <p>But that the Authors meaning in impleading the ſaid latter propoſition<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> of error, was far differing from this, appears ſufficiently by the account which Himſelf gives hereof in the ſequell of his Diſcourſe. From this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it cleerly appears, that in framing the ſaid latter propoſition, he uſeth thoſe words, <hi>ex Dei intentione,</hi> for, <hi>cum Dei intentione;</hi> and placeth the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the propoſition in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that it ſuppoſeth an intention to be in God of giving life unto all men upon their Faith, when He makes the offer mentioned unto them. To prove this to be an error, he argues to this effect, from <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 2. (for his other arguments are plainely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>God the Father gave power unto the Sonne to give eternall life to thoſe</hi> ONLY, <hi>who were given unto him by the Father. But reprobates</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are not given unto the Sonne by the Father: therefore the Father gave no power unto the Sonne to give eternall life unto Reprobates:</hi> and conſequently <hi>the Sonne cannot, either accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own, or to his Fathers Intention, offer remiſsion of ſinnes or eternall life unto Reprobates.</hi> To this I anſwer, that the whole proceede of the argument ariſeth from a miſtaken ground, or a plaine miſ-underſtanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, upon which it is built. For by a <hi>power given unto the Sonne to give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life,</hi> &amp;c. is not meant a power of dying for men, one or other, but a power of an actuall and reall inveſting men with eternall life, or a power to confer eternall life actually upon men, as appears from the former clauſe of the Verſe: <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternall life, &amp;c.</hi> From whence it is evident, that the <hi>Power</hi> here ſpoken of as given
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94900:77"/> unto the <hi>Sonne,</hi> to <hi>give eternall life,</hi> &amp;c. is a conſequent, branch, or effect, of that Power or Sovereignty, which the Father hath given him over all man-kinde, as <hi>viz.</hi> to diſpoſe of them, eſpecially in reſpect of their eternall eſtates and conditions, according to ſuch Rules of righteouſneſſe and equity, as the Father, with the Son, have judged meet, and accordingly agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the regulating of ſuch high and important diſpenſations. Now a power of conferring <hi>eternall life</hi> upon men, may very well be conceived to be a branch or part of that ſovereignty, or larger power, which the Father hath given unto the Son <hi>over all fleſh.</hi> But an injunction or command, or a free leave or liberty (Notion it how you pleaſe) given unto Him to die for a few men, cannot reaſonably be looked upon as any Part or Branch, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as any ſuch conſiderable or high-importing branch, as this here expreſſed muſt needs be conceived to be, of that moſt tranſcendent, and majeſtique power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or,</p>
            <p>2. By <hi>eternall life,</hi> may very well be meant, not <hi>eternall life</hi> properly and<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> formally ſo called, as <hi>viz.</hi> the bleſſedneſſe and glory of the World to come; but ſuch a diſcovery or manifeſtation of God, and His Counſells, which is an effectuall meanes to bring men in time to the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of this <hi>life.</hi> It is a frequent Dialect of Scripture, to call the meanes, and cauſe, yea and ſometimes an opportunity only, which are proper and effectuall for the compaſſing, effecting, or obtaining a thing, by the name of the thing it ſelf, which is to be, or may be, procured, or effected by them. Thus <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 7. the wages or rewards, by which the Elders of <hi>Moab</hi> ſent from <hi>Balaak</hi> the King to <hi>Balaam</hi> the Wizard, expected to procure <hi>Divinations,</hi> or ſome imprecatory and divelliſh Practiſes againſt the People of God, from Him, are termed, <hi>Divinations.

In this Phraſe of Speech, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or the ſaving Knowledge of God therein revealed, are (according to the generall ſence of our beſt Interpreters) termed, <hi>Salvation, Joh.</hi> 4. 22. So again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2. Thus <hi>wiſdome,</hi> is called a mans <hi>life [keepe her, for ſhee is thy life, Pro.</hi> 4. 13.] becauſe ſhee is the meanes of <hi>life, i. e.</hi> of Peace and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being unto men. In this ſence alſo (to forbeare further inſtances, which are in great numbers at hand) the Goſpell (and ſometimes the Preaching or Miniſtry of it) is frequently termed, <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> According to this manner of ſpeaking (ſo familiar in the Scriptures) by <hi>eternall life,</hi> which the Son had <hi>Power given</hi> Him <hi>over all fleſh,</hi> that He might <hi>give to as many as the Father had given him,</hi> may well be meant the <hi>words of eternall life,</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> calls them <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 68.) or that <hi>Manifeſtation of the Name of God</hi> (as Himſelf ſpeaketh, ſoone after, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 6.) by which they might be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually brought to the fruition and injoyment of <hi>eternall life.</hi> And that this indeed is the very meaning of our Saviour, is abundantly evident by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell of the Context all along, for ſeveral Verſes together.

And this is life eternall, that they know thee the only true God, and him whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This Notion He ſtill carrieth on, ſaying, Verſe 6. <hi>I have manifested thy Name unto the Men, which thou gaveſt Me out of the World: thine they were, and thou gaveſt them Me, &amp;c.</hi> So again (directly ſtill to the ſame point, Verſe 8.)

            <p>From the carriage of the Context, that further is abundantly evident, that<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> by thoſe words, <hi>Verſe 2. as many as thou hast given Him,</hi> are not meant the <hi>Elect,</hi> or the intire number of the Elect, or of thoſe, for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died (in Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> ſence,) but preciſely and particularly, His Apoſtles: of whom alone He ſpeaks, and for whom alone, and apart from the reſt of the Elect, He Prayeth, all along the Chapter, untill <hi>Verſe</hi> 20. where He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth His Prayer thus: <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe in Me through their word.</hi> For this paſſage it is as cleer as the Sun at noone day, that from the beginning of the Chapter untill now, He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad managed His Prayer, and Heavenly Conference with the Father, with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reference to His Apoſtles; and had not mentioned any thing about the reſidue of the Elect. That He ſpeaks of the Apoſtles only <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. under thoſe words, <hi>as many as thou haſt given Me,</hi> is moſt apparant from Verſe 6. <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name unto the Men which thou gavest Me out of the World: thine they were, and thou gaveſt them Me, and they</hi> HAVE KEPT <hi>thy Word.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not yet <hi>manifeſted</hi> His Fathers <hi>Name</hi> to all the Elect, no not to all the Elect, at this time in being in the World. 2. Neither could He ſay to His Father concerning all the Elect, that they <hi>had kept His Word,</hi> many of them having not as yet received it. Again (to paſſe by ſeverall things by the way making out the ſame truth) <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. Thus: <hi>whileſt I was with them in the World</hi> (meaning, thoſe, of whom He had ſpoken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>om the beginning of the Chapter) <hi>I kept them in thy Name, [i. e.</hi> I preſerved them from the exorbitances of the World, by the knowledge of thy <hi>Name,</hi> which ſtill I have been communicating unto them,] <hi>thoſe that thou gaveſt Me, I have kept; and none of them is loſt, but the Sonne of perdition,</hi> &amp;c. Evident it is, that this <hi>Sonne of Perdition,</hi> was one of that number of Men, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given Him out of the World, and which He had <hi>kept</hi> intirely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the miſcarriage of any one (this Son of Perdition only excepted.) I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that neither Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> nor any of his judgement, will ſay that this <hi>Son of perdition</hi> was one of the number of the Elect, but certaine it is, that he was one of that number of men, which the Father had given unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of the World. The words are too too expreſſe to beare a deniall of this: <hi>thoſe that thou gaveſt Me, I have kept: and none</hi> OF THEM <hi>is loſt, but the Son of perdition,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore by, <hi>as many as the Father had given unto Him,</hi> with an intent that He <hi>ſhould give eternall life unto them,</hi> Verſe 2. are meant the Apoſtles, and theſe only.

Thus <hi>Acts 13. 20. He gave them Judges,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> He qualified and furniſhed men amongſt them from time to time, with publique ſpirits, and with gifts fit for government, &amp;c. So <hi>Neh. 9. 27. thou</hi> GAVEST <hi>them Saviours;</hi> i. e. thou furniſhedſt Men with Hearts, and Courage, and Wiſdom, &amp;c. to ſave them. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22.

Our Saviour Himſelf uſeth the word in the ſence now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced from the Scriptures, when He expreſſeth Himſelf thus; <hi>All that the Father giveth Me, ſhall</hi> [or rather will] <hi>come unto Me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. Of which place more in due time.</p>
            <p>Nor ought it to ſeeme any hard, uncouth, or unpleaſant expreſſion unto<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> us, wherein that which is prepared, or any wayes made fit for us, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſo diſpoſed of, or ſet in our way, that we may readily and lawfully ſerve our ſelves with it, is ſaid to be GIVEN unto us, by Him, or them, who thus prepare, and diſpoſe of it.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94900:79"/> terms, or no. So God the Father, having wrought and fitted the men, whom <hi>Christ</hi> choſe for Apoſtles, to ſerve and honor Him in this capacity, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſpoſed of them in their Times, Reſidences, and Conditions in the World, ſo that <hi>Christ</hi> might both readily and lawfully call them to His Service, He may very well, in theſe reſpects, be ſaid to <hi>have given them unto Him.</hi>

            <p>Thus by a diligent and narrow inquiry into Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> Scripture, it evidently appears that there is <hi>nec vola, nec veſtigium,</hi> not the leaſt mutter or peepe of any ſuch Notion in it, as he imagineth, <hi>viz.</hi> that if Chriſt ſhould Offer, <hi>eternall life</hi> unto any more, then only unto the Elect (ſo called by Him) He muſt needs doe it beſides His own, and His Fathers <hi>Intention.</hi> Here is not the leaſt word, ſyllable, letter, apex, or <gap reason="foreign">

For if the Dying of Chriſt for Men, be to be eſteemed matter of Love to them (as without all controverſie and queſtion it ought) what reaſon can
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94900:79"/> there be imagined why he ſhould die for Apoſtate Reprobates (who yet are that kinde of Reprobate, for which only <hi>Christ</hi> Died, according to that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) rather then for thoſe, who though living and dying in unbeliefe, yet never contracted the guilt, of ſo deſperate and provoking a ſin? But this by the way.</p>
            <p>The tenor of the Scripture firſt in view, amongſt thoſe lately appearing, is<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> this: <hi>destroy not him with thy meat, for whom</hi> Chriſt <hi>Died</hi>

            <p>Firſt, that the <hi>destruction</hi> here ſpoken of, whereunto the ſtrong Chriſtian is ſo earneſtly admoniſhed and dehorted by the Apoſtle from expoſing the weake, is not any temporall deſtruction, but that which is of body and ſoule for ever, is more cleare, then to require Proof. It is not eaſily imaginable, how, or that, a ſtrong Chriſtian, or any other Man, by eating <hi>meate ſacrificed unto Idols,</hi> ſhould expoſe a weake Chriſtian unto the danger of any other <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> but of that only, which is Decreed by God, againſt thoſe, who ſhall depart from the Faith, or finally apoſtatize from the Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Beſides, it is every mans Notion, that this is that <hi>Destruction,</hi> that firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>borne of things formidable and dreadfull unto the precious ſoules of men, with which this great Apoſtle had ſo much to doe, and from which the great Prize that he runs for with all his might in all his Epiſtles, was to deliver them.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas he chargeth Men, not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> thoſe, <hi>for whom Christ Died,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> though he doth not indeed ſuppoſe, that all thoſe ſhall be actually <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> or periſh, whom another may be ſaid to <hi>deſtroy, i. e.</hi> to doe things tending to their deſtruction (which is the ſence of the word in this place) yet this he cleerly ſuppoſeth, that ſuch men, <hi>for whom Christ Died,</hi> are obnoxious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, may be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and periſh everlaſtingly.

            <p>If it be ſaid; yea but though it be ſuppoſed, that the Perſons admoniſhed<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> in this caſe, do know in in the generall, that they, for whom <hi>Chriſt Died,</hi> are not under a poſſibility of Periſhing, yet they may be ignorant in Particular, whether thoſe Men, whoſe <hi>deſtruction</hi> they are like to Procure, or Promote, by the abuſe of their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> liberty, be of the number of thoſe Men, for whom <hi>Chriſt Died,</hi> or no: and conſequently the Apoſtle may upon a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count admoniſh them to take heed of <hi>deſtroying</hi> ſuch;</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, it can at no hand be ſuppoſed, that the Perſons here admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould be ignorant, whether the Men, about whoſe <hi>destruction,</hi> they are ſo deeply cautioned by the Apoſtle, be of the number of thoſe, for whom <hi>Chriſt Died,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle himſelf ſo plainely and poſitively aſſerteth it: <hi>for whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt Died.</hi> Beſides, the maine ſtrength and ſtreſſe of the argument or motive, by which he inforceth the dehortation, ſtandeth in this, that thoſe Perſons, whoſoever they be, whoſe <hi>Salvation</hi> they ſhall endanger by eating things ſacrificed to Idolls, are of thoſe for whom <hi>Chriſt Died.</hi> Now to preſſe an exhortation, or dehortation, upon the conſciences
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94900:80"/> of Men by ſuch a motive, wherein theſe Men ſhall be ſuppoſed ignorant whether there be any Truth, or no, is to fight with a wooden Sword; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it ſhall be yet further ſuppoſed, that ſuch Men are under an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute incapacity of ever knowing, whether there be any Truth, or no, in this motive; which muſt needs be the caſe here, if we ſhall ſuppoſe there be any number of Men, for whom <hi>Chriſt Died not.</hi> For unpoſſible it is (and ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally confeſt to be) for one man certainly to know the Truth of Grace, or Faith, in another; and much more to know the certainty of his Preſeverance unto the end: and conſequently (according to the Principles of Anti-univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaliſme) for any Man to know, whether <hi>Chriſt Died</hi> for any Man in Particular, and by Name, but Himſelf.</p>
            <p>Therefore moſt certaine it is, that there is a poſſibility for thoſe to periſh, and be deſtroyed, for whom <hi>Chriſt Died,</hi> or notwithſtanding <hi>Chriſts Dying</hi> for them. And if ſo, then Chriſts dying for Men doth not ſuppoſe a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of their Salvation: and if ſo, then Chriſt Died as well for thoſe, who may not be ſaved, and ſhall not be ſaved, as for thoſe, who may, and ſhall; and conſequently, for all Men: for they who may, and ſhall be ſaved, and they who may not, neither ſhall be ſaved, together comprehend all Men whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The Expoſition of the Scripture in hand, as importing the <hi>Death of Chriſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> for thoſe, who yet may be <hi>deſtroyed</hi> and periſh, is ſo pregnant with evidence and truth, that it hath ſubdued the judgements of all Expoſitors I meet with, unto it. <hi>And</hi> Chriſt <hi>verily</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chryſostome</hi> upon the place) <hi>refuſed not, neither to be made a ſervant, nor to die for him: and wilt not thou ſo much as neglect thy belly to ſave him?

This difference in the point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes none in the matter, or ſubſtance of the Doctrine contained in the words. Only the interrogative is more piercing, and provoking to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Truth imported. The tenor of the place is the ſame (in effect) with that laſt opened: and cleerly ſuppoſeth (upon the account gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the traverſe of that Scripture) that ſuch a Perſon may miſcarry in the great buſineſſe of Salvation, notwithſtanding <hi>Chriſts</hi> laying down His Life for him.

For if it ſhall be ſuppoſed, that that kinde of offender againſt the weak <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> of whom the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh, knoweth certainly before hand, that his act in eating meate ſacrificed unto Idolls, can have no ſuch ſad effect, or ſequell upon it, as the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of a <hi>weak Brother,</hi> muſt he not needs be tempted hereby, to deſpiſe the Apoſtles charge on that behalf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded mainely upon ſuch an Aſſertion or Suppoſall? and ſo be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, or incouraged in his ſinfull Practiſe? To put reſtrictions upon Scripture Phraſes or Aſſertions, without neceſſity, and this demonſtrable, either from other Scriptures, or unqueſtionable grounds of Reaſon, is not to interpret the Scriptures now in being, but (upon the matter) to make new.</p>
            <p>If it be replied in favour of the ſaid limitation or explication of <hi>Piſcator;</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 12.</note> that there will be great weight, and force enough to command the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Men, in the Apoſtles argument, and to take them off from abuſe of their liberty, though it ſhould be ſuppoſed that there is only a tendency in ſuch a Practiſe towards the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of weak Believers, whether it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that ſuch Perſons may actually <hi>Periſh</hi> and be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> or not:</p>
            <p>I anſwer; there can be no tendency ſuppoſed, in any action, or meanes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an impoſſibility. For that which is ſimply impoſſible, or (which is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94900:82"/> the ſame, in effect) impoſſible upon a condition, that is immutable and cannot faile, is never the more poſſible, nor any whit neerer unto being, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other account, or for any thing whatſoever that can be done. Therefore there is nothing can be done with any tendency towards the effecting of ſuch a thing. Beſides, were it granted, that there is a <hi>tendency</hi> in ſuch a Practiſe, the forbearance whereof the Apoſtle urgeth, towards the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of a weake Brother, yea and further, that this Practiſe in reſpect of ſuch a <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> in it, were ſinfull; yet would there be very little in either, or both of theſe, to deter men from ſuch a Practiſe, unleſſe it be withall ſuppoſed, that that ſad effect, whereunto the ſaid <hi>tendency</hi> is acknowledged to relate, may poſſibly be Effected or Produced by it. For the more ſecure a ſinner may be, that his ſinfull Practiſe will not be ſo ſadly conſequenced, as, the Nature and Property of it only conſidered, it might very poſſibly be, the greater tentation lieth upon him to adventure upon it. The confidence which <hi>Judas</hi> had, that his act in betraying his Maſter, would not have been accompanied with His Death, but that he would now, as ſeverall times before he had done, finde ſome way or other to make an eſcape from thoſe, into whoſe hands He was betrayed, was one maine thing which betrayed Him into the deadly ſnare of that moſt abominable fact. For it is ſaid, that <hi>when</hi> Judas <hi>ſaw that he was condemned</hi> (which implies, that this was more then He feared, or expected, notwithſtanding his act in betraying Him) <hi>he repented himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and caſt down the pieces of ſilver in the Temple, and departed, and went and hanged Himſelf</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 27. 3 5</note>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, (and laſtly) the mention and tender of an impoſſible effect by way of motive, to over-rule the Conſciences of men againſt a Practice in one kinde or other, whereunto they are inclined, is little leſſe then ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: eſpecially when the ſaid impoſſibilitie is preſumed to be known before hand to him, the over ruling of whoſe Conſcience is attempted thereby. Suppoſe I be full of this Perſwaſion, 1. That I am a true Believer. 2. That being ſuch, I am under an impoſſibility ever to fall away ſo as to Periſh, and under this double Perſwaſion, were very much addicted to ſuch, or ſuch a ſinfull courſe; the conſideration of my falling away and periſhing, were the moſt improper and impertinent argument, that lightly could be Preſſed upon me, to perſwade me out of the Way and Practice of my ſin.</p>
            <p>But ſome as willing to break looſe from the Scripture in hand, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> yet being not ſatisfied with their Projection for an eſcape, trie the ſame concluſion another way, and by another device. The Apoſtle, (ſay they) calls a weak Profeſſor of the Goſpell, by the name of a <hi>Brother,</hi> not as if it could be demonſtratively known that he is a <hi>Brother</hi> indeed, but becauſe others ſtand bound by the <hi>Law of Charity</hi> to judge him ſuch: after the ſame manner he ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt died for him;</hi> not as if he would have men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this according to the judgement, or with the certainty, of Faith, but only with the judgement of Charity. Upon this ſuppoſall, they draw up the Apoſtles argument for him, thus:—<hi>thy Brother ſhall periſh, for whom, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> by the abuſe of thy knowledge, thou mayſt be the deſtruction of him, whom thou art bound <hi>in Charity</hi> to look upon as thy <hi>Brother</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and one of thoſe, for whom <hi>Chriſt died.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Why ſtand we not bound to believe, only with the judgement of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not with the certainty of Faith, that Chriſt is the Son of God, or Saviour of the World, &amp;c. as well as to believe only after this manner, that he may <hi>periſh, for whom Chriſt died;</hi> this latter being as poſitively, as cleerly,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94900:82"/> as roundly and fully aſſerted by the Holy Ghoſt, as either of the former? Or what is ſuch a liberty of Interpreting Scriptures, as this (being interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) but an <hi>effectuall door opened</hi> for the reducing of all things whatſoever in matters of Religion, yea the Truth and Authority of the Scriptures themſelves, to the <hi>judgement of Charity,</hi> and conſequently to the caſting the <hi>judgement of Faith</hi> out of doores? But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To enjoyn me a beliefe only according to the <hi>judgement of Charity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> where a belief according the judgement of Faith, would be ten times more beneficiall and ſerviceable unto me for the preſerving of me from ſin, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the ground-work of Divine Revelation before me will better, and with leſſe deſcant upon the words, admit the latter beliefe, then the former, (which is the caſe in the Scripture in hand) is very contrary to the Rule of Charity, which reſtraineth me from doing my Neighbour any prejudice, or harme, as well in his ſpirituall, as outward, eſtate: yea, and much more in the former, then in the latter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If I ſtand bound to believe with the judgement of Faith, that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> for any man to <hi>periſh, for whom Chriſt Died,</hi> what will ſuch a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration as this (whether believed, according to the one judgement or the other) <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Chriſt Died</hi> for ſuch, or ſuch a man, advantage me, by way of preſerving me from ſuch a practiſe, which is apt to <hi>deſtroy</hi> him? For if it be a truth, that <hi>Christ</hi> did die for him, I need not (according to the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition mentioned) be at all tender about doing any thing, or forbearing any thing, out of any apprehenſion of danger, leſt by the one, or the other, I ſhould occaſion his deſtruction. If it be a truth that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not <hi>die for him,</hi> upon what account ſhould the Apoſtle ſuggeſt unto me that he did <hi>die for him,</hi> or that it may be that he did die for him, by way of argument, to deter me from doing that, which may tend to his deſtruction? Suppoſe one part of the men in the World were impenetrable and invulnerable, the other part, as now they are, expoſed unto the danger of death upon wounds recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; were it a congruous motive or gound of perſwaſion, whereby to cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me from wounding or ſmiting ſuch, or ſuch a man, with a Sword, Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or the like, to inform me, that this man is, or may be, invulnerable? or that I ought to preſume, or judge this man, to be invulnerable? Would not ſuch an argument as this rather ſtrengthen my hand to a ſmiting of him, then any wayes occaſion me to forbeare? They cleerly make the Holy Ghoſt Himſelf to reaſon at no better rate of underſtanding, then this, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in hand, who make it only a matter of Charity to believe that <hi>Chriſt Died for a weake Brother;</hi> and that in caſe he did die for him, he is upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count undeſtroyable.</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) moſt evident it is, that the ſcope of the Apoſtle, in that,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. (and there is the ſame conſideration of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.) is to deterre Chriſtians from an unſeaſonable and undue uſe of their liberty and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and this by an argument or motive drawn, not ſo much from what is unſeemely, uncomely, or dangerous, in reſpect of themſelves, but from the conſideration of what danger or damage may very poſſibly accrue thereby unto others. The whole tenor and carriage of both Contexts Proclaime this aloud: ſo that there needs no more proof of it, then only the peruſall of the Chapters themſelves. Now the danger, or dammage, which a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> by ſuch an abuſe of his liberty, as is here expreſſed, may very poſſibly create, or occaſion to another, the Apoſtle affirmes to be the <hi>deſtroying of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for whom Chriſt Died,</hi> i. e. the depriving of him of that great Salvation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94900:83"/> and bleſſedneſſe, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> by His Death purchaſed for him. Now if this ſtrong <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſtands bound to believe, according to the judgement of Charity, that this Perſon is a true <hi>Brother,</hi> and one for whom <hi>Chriſt Died,</hi> he ſtands bound to believe, according to the ſame judgement at leaſt, if not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgement of Faith it ſelf, that he <hi>may periſh</hi> through the abuſe of his liberty. Otherwiſe the Apoſtles argument for the diſſwading of him from ſuch an abuſe, cannot be ſuppoſed to take any place in him, nor worke at all upon him in order to ſuch an end. For no conſideration or ſaying what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, unleſſe believed with one kinde of Faith, or other, can have any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or operation upon men, either to perſwade them to, or from, any practiſe. If then the ſtrong <hi>Christian</hi> ſtands bound to believe, be it only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgement of Charity, that the weak Profeſſor is a <hi>Brother</hi> indeed, and one for whom <hi>Christ Died,</hi> he ſtands bound alſo to believe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the one judgement or the other, that he may <hi>periſh</hi> through his Unchriſtian miſdemeanor in the uſe of his liberty. If ſo, then he (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, every other Chriſtian) ſtands bound in Conſcience to believe, that ſuch a man may <hi>periſh,</hi> for whom he ſtands bound in Conſcience like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to believe that <hi>Christ Died.</hi> For a belief according to the judgement of Charity, where it is required, is matter of duty and of Conſcience, as well as a belief according to the judgement of Faith, in caſes appropriate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>Neither is it true, according to the Principles of that opinion, which we now implead, that a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſtands bound in Conſcience to believe, no not according to the judgement of Charity, that all that Profeſſe the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are true <hi>Brethren,</hi> or Perſons for whom <hi>Chriſt Died.</hi> For the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of this opinion generally hold, 1. That many who make ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, are Hypocrites, and not true <hi>Brethren.</hi> 2. That many of this number, will <hi>periſh</hi> at laſt in their Hypocriſie and Unbelief. And thus far they hold nothing but truth. But, 3. (and laſtly) they hold yet further (which they ſhould doe better to let goe) that Chriſt Died for none of thoſe Profeſſors, who <hi>periſh</hi> in the end. Theſe things they hold and believe, not with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe according to the judgement of Charity, but dogmatically, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the judgement or certainty of Faith. Now certaine it is, that no man ſtands bound in Conſcience to believe that according to the judgement of Charity, which is contrary to what he believeth, or what he truly judgeth Himſelf bound in Conſcience to believe, according to the judgement of Faith: becauſe no Law or Rule of Charity bindeth me to believe, with any kinde of belief whatſoever, that God is a Lyar, or Untrue in his Word, which is the Foundation and Rule of what I ſtand bound to believe according to the judgement of Faith. Such men therefore, who believe according to the judgement of Faith, that all Profeſſors of Chriſtianity ſhall not at laſt be ſaved, cannot, with the ſafety of their own Principles, ſay they ſtand bound in Conſcience to believe, with the belief of Charity, that <hi>Chriſt Died</hi> for them all: becauſe in their Notion, and according to their grounds, theſe two Propoſitions are inconſiſtent in Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould <hi>die</hi> for all, and yet ſome, <hi>periſh.</hi> But thus it ſtill happeneth to thoſe, who are ingaged in the defence of an error; I meane, to intangle themſelves, and to non-ſenſifie ſuch Paſſages of Scripture, which manifeſtly oppoſe their error, by ſuch evaſions, ſuch unnaturall and forc'd Interpretations, which for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive of ſuch a Tenet, which were better dead, they are neceſſitated unto.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:94900:83"/>
            <p>Nor will it availe them here to reply, that they doe not judge themſelves<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> bound in Conſcience to believe in a way of Charity, that all and every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, are true <hi>Brethren,</hi> or Perſons for whom <hi>Chriſt Died,</hi> but only that there is no Particular or ſingle Perſon in this heap, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom they ſtand not bound by the <hi>Law of charity</hi> thus to believe, at leaſt untill they have miniſtred grounds of ſuſpition that indeed they are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites; For to this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In ſuch an Explication of themſelves as this, they cleerly grant, that for a time, <hi>viz.</hi> untill Profeſſors adminiſter grounds of jealouſie that their Faith is not ſound, they ſtand bound to conceive of them all, one or other, without exception, (I meane, according to the judgement of Charity) t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at <hi>Chriſt Died</hi> for them. But ſuch a belief as this is contrary to what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve dogmatically (as hath been ſaid) and according to the judgement of Faith. Therefore ſtill they enterfeere. For to believe that <hi>Chriſt Died</hi> for every individual Profeſſor, and to believe that He <hi>Died</hi> for all Profeſſors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, is but one and the ſame belief, nor can any difference be ſhewed between them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither is a Symptome of Hypocriſie, ſeene or obſerved in a Profeſſor,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> any ſufficient ground for the reverſall of ſuch a judgement of Charity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Him, according unto which we judged Him a Perſon for whom <hi>Chriſt Died.</hi> Becauſe, 1. There may be many Symptomes or Signes of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, which are not demonſtrative, or of any eſſentiall eviction. And 2. If a man were an evicted Hypocrite, yet may he recover from under this condemnation. Therefore Hypocriſie, though certainly known by a man, is no ſufficient or reaſonable ground, no not according to the grounds of the Doctrine now oppugned, why I may not, or ought not, in a way of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to judge that <hi>Chriſt Died</hi> for him notwithſtanding. Thus then we ſee at laſt, that no Colour, Plea or Pretence; no turning, ſhifting, or winding about, this way, or that, will ſalve the impertinency, that I ſay not, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune abſurdity, of any interpretation whatſoever of the Scripture in hand, which doth not (in a cleer comportance with the words, and ſcope and drift of the Apoſtle therein) ſuppoſe a poſſibility of their Periſhing, for whom <hi>Chriſt Died,</hi> and that in order to their non-Periſhing; (as we ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew further before the end of this Chapter, in aſſerting another Paſſage of Scripture to the ſame Point.)</p>
            <p>The next (in the order propounded) is 2 <hi>Peter 2. 1. But there were falſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> 
               <hi>prophets among the People, even as there ſhall be falſe Teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction.</hi> Here it is cleerly ſuppoſed, and as good as in plaine terms affirmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that men <hi>bought by the Lord (viz.</hi> Chriſt, as all Interpreters expound) may, yea and that ſome will, <hi>bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves destruction.</hi> If ſo, then evident it is, that the <hi>Lord</hi> Chriſt <hi>bought</hi> with the Price of His Blood, as well thoſe who <hi>periſh,</hi> and are <hi>destroyed</hi> by their own wickedneſſe, as thoſe that are ſaved; and conſequently, all men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception.</p>
            <p>That which is excepted againſt this Interpretation, and Inference from<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> the place, is very faint and weake; if you deſire it, as it is, I ſhall impart it. Firſt (ſay ſome) the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> is not here ſaid to buy thoſe here ſpoken of, and who are ſaid to bring deſtruction upon themſelves, after the ſame manner, or upon the like terms, on which he is, or may be ſaid to <hi>buy</hi> thoſe, that are ſaved: theſe He buyes for one end, or with one intent, as <hi>viz.</hi> to adopt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94900:84"/> for ſons: thoſe, with another, as, <hi>viz.</hi> for ſlaves and vaſſalls only. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the World never heard of ſuch a purchaſe as this, made by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> till theſe latter dayes; I meane, of men, only to make ſlaves and vaſſalls of them. Certaine I am, that the Scripture makes <hi>Chriſts free-men,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſervants, or <hi>bondmen,</hi> all one. <hi>For he that is called in the Lord</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>being a ſervant, is the Lords freeman: likewiſe alſo he that is called, being free, is Chriſts</hi> ſervant, or <hi>bondman</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 22.</note>. And indeed, it is the bleſſed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and freedome which we obtaine by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that makes us His ſervants or bondmen, <hi>i. e.</hi> which ingageth us to be ſuch unto him. But if Chriſt buyes Men with the Price of His Blood only for ſlaves and vaſſalls, I would know whether they come to the actuall injoyment of this Priviledge (for ſuch it muſt needs be ſuppoſed, as by the Context it ſelfe will appeare preſently) by Faith, or without Faith. It cannot be ſaid that they come to the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it by Faith; for by Faith men are put into the bleſſed relation of ſons: <hi>Yee are all the children of God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3. 26.</note>. If they ſhould come to it without Faith, then Chriſt ſhould ſhew more favour (at leaſt in this reſpect) to his vaſſalls, then to His Sons. His Sons come not to the actuall injoyment of their Priviledge, but by Faith: but His ſlaves (it ſeemes) may attain the actuall injoyment of theirs, without the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this, or any other condition whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Againe, if Chriſt bought wicked Men and ſuch as periſh, for ſlaves and<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> vaſſalls, I would know whether they act the parts of ſlaves and vaſſalls, and ſo ſerve Him in that capacity, which He aimed at in His purchaſe of them; or whether they act contrary to the Nature and Lawes of ſlavery or vaſſallage. If they act as ſlaves and vaſſalls, then they anſwer and fulfill their <hi>Lords</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and deſires in His Purchaſe, and ſo are not to be blamed, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended rather. If it be ſaid that they act otherwiſe (I meane, then as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth ſlaves and vaſſalls) this muſt be either by acting righteouſly, or unrighteouſly. If it be by acting righteouſly that they tranſgreſſe the Law of ſlavery, then it followes, that men may prove better, and live more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, then Chriſt ever intended, or deſired they ſhould. If it be by acting unrighteouſly, then Chriſt did not intend, that thoſe whom He bought for ſlaves, ſhould live unrighteouſly, but holily. If ſo, then were His intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards thoſe, whom He bought for ſlaves, altogether as gracious, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe, whom He purchaſed for ſons; His intentions towards and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe (in His purchaſe of them) being clearly this, that they ſhould <hi>ſerve him in righteouſneſs</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 1. 74. 75.</note>.</p>
            <p>Againe, if Chriſt ſhould buy ſome Men for ſlaves and vaſſalls, then in<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> caſe any of theſe, bought for ſuch an end, or with ſuch an intention, as this, ſhould repent and believe, Chriſt ſhould be, not only diſappointed in His bargaine, but this by the righteouſneſſe of the perſons bought, or bargained for by Him. To alledge here, that it is unpoſſible that any perſon, who is bought for a ſlave, ſhould repent, or believe; 1. Is abſolutely untrue, there being no man but only he, who hath ſinned the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, who is not in a capacity or poſſibility of Repentance. 2. Though it were true, yet it hinders not at all the truth, or the force of the conſequence in the propoſition mentioned; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>in caſe any of thoſe ſhould repent, whom</hi> Chriſt <hi>hath bought for ſlaves, then he ſhould be diſappointed in his bargaine, and that by the righteouſneſſe of thoſe bought by Him.</hi> Reaſon teacheth us, that a Connex propoſition may be demonſtratively true and pregnant, though both the parts of it be never ſo falſe. As for example; if <hi>Iſmael</hi> had been
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94900:84"/> the naturall ſon of <hi>Lot,</hi> he could not have been the naturall ſon of <hi>Abraham:</hi> this is a propoſition of a manifeſt and cleer truth, yet both parts of it are falſe. For, 1. <hi>Iſmael</hi> was not the naturall ſon of <hi>Lot:</hi> 2. He was the naturall ſon of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Yet,</p>
            <p>Againe; if Chriſt bought ſome for ſlaves, then hath he ſome baſe, ſervile,<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> hard, or drudgery work to doe, ſuch as is not meet for ſons to put their hand unto. For they have no need of ſlaves, that have no ſervile, or ſlaviſh work to doe. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath no work to doe, but that which is Honorable, and worthy the moſt ingenuous of all His ſons to doe. <hi>All the Commandements of God (David</hi> ſaith) <hi>are righteouſneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 172.</note>. And a little before: <hi>All thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are truth</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 151.</note>. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath no more Worke to be done by Men, in the World, then God hath: neither hath God any more, then what is expreſſed and ſet forth in His Commandements: and all theſe (as we heard from <hi>David) are righteouſneſſe, [i. e.</hi> require nothing but what is righteous and juſt for Men to doe,] and conſequently meet for ſons, yea chiefly for ſons, or righteous ones to doe. Yea, God hath no neede of any Mans lye, or of any Mans ſin whatſoever. Therefore neither did Chriſt buy any for ſlaves.</p>
            <p>Once more: if the Perſons here ſaid to be <hi>bought by Chriſt,</hi> were <hi>bought</hi> by<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> Him for ſlaves, then muſt the Apoſtle be conceived to extenuate their ſin in denying Him, by ſaying, that He <hi>bought them:</hi> whereas by the emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call carriage of the Context it is evident, that His intent was, by this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to aggravate that their ſin, and ſet forth the hainouſneſſe, the high demerit and provocation of it. He that buyes Men, being ſlaves, to make them free Men, and ſet them at liberty, may well expect thanks and free ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from them: and if they ſhould not own ſuch a Perſon as their Great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, they deſerve, not only to be deveſted of that liberty, which this Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor of theirs hath purchaſed for them, but to be ſubjected to a Bondage ſeven times more grievous then that, from which they were delivered. But if a Man ſhall buy thoſe that were ſlaves before, only to put them into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of worſe ſlavery, then that wherein they were, they are not to be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they <hi>deny</hi> Him to be any Great Benefactor to them. In like manner, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall be here ſaid to buy the Men ſpoken of, for ſlaves only, He ſhould buy them out of a more eaſie ſlavery, from under a lighter condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, only to put them into an harder Bondage, and ſubject them to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condemnation: and conſequently, their not owning Him, or their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> Him as any Benefactor unto them, were no juſt matter of provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Him, nor of diſpleaſure from God. What is that eſtate of Bondage, or Miſery, in any kinde, out of which Chriſt may be ſaid to buy thoſe, whom He is ſuppoſed to buy for ſlaves? And what is that eſtate of ſlavery, unto which He ſubjectth them, or into which He putteth them, by this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, or buying of them; that ſo we may compare them together? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that Bondage and Miſery, out of which theſe Men can be ſuppoſed to be <hi>bought</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> is, in the utmoſt Line and Pitch of it, but an obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or liableneſſe to have been caſt into Hell fire for their ſin, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in, or contracted from <hi>Adam,</hi> as ſoone as they were conceived, or borne, or the like: but that eſtate of ſlavery, whereinto (according to that interpretation of the place, which we now oppoſe) they are bought, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>bought</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is ſeven times more grievous then ſo. For, 1. Under this they are as liable to be thrown into Hell fire, as in the other. Nay, 2. They are ſure to be caſt into Hell fire with much more guilt of ſin upon
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94900:85"/> them, then in their former condition they were capable of; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſo much the more grievouſly tormented for ever. Therefore their ſin of denying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is ſo far from being aggravated by their being bought by Him for ſlaves, that indeed it is extenuated, and brought to nothing by it: and conſequently ſuch an interpretation is diametrally oppoſite to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles intent in the place.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, (for this) if <hi>Chriſt bought</hi> the <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> here ſpoken of, with<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> other wicked Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who <hi>in fine</hi> periſh, for ſlaves, in what reſpect, or with what intentions, may He be ſuppoſed to have bought ſuch Infants, who dying in their infancy, and before the committing of actuall ſin, are ſuppoſed, through the want of the Priviledge of Election, to Periſh? Muſt we not have another Device, or Notion, whereby to forme the Intentions of <hi>Christ</hi> in His Purchaſe of theſe? For it can at no hand of reaſon be ſaid, or thought, that He <hi>bought</hi> theſe for ſlaves, in as much as He never intended that theſe ſhould live ſo much as to a capacity of doing any worke at all, in one kinde, or other, for Him. If the Aſſertors of the Interpretation now ready to fall, ſhall think to relieve themſelves at this Point, by ſaying, that it is not neceſſary that <hi>Christ</hi> ſhould at all minde ſuch Children in His Purchaſe, ſo as to <hi>buy</hi> them in one kinde or other, but may well be conceived only to leave them, as He found them; I would demand of them only this; how then, or upon what account, ſuch Children ſhould injoy the benefit of life, though but for a ſhort ſeaſon, as for a Month, two, &amp;c. together with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of life appropriate to their Age, as nouriſhment, nurſing, looking to, &amp;c. If no conſideration at all was had of ſuch in the Death and Purchaſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I would gladly underſtand what other Friend they had to Mediate with God for ſuch things on their behalfe: or whether God be ſo far well pleaſed with them without all mediation, as to indulge ſuch mercies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts unto them?</p>
            <p>Nor can it with any Colour of Reaſon be ſaid, that <hi>Christ</hi> bought the<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> Perſons here ſpoken of for ſlaves, or ſervants unto the Saints: becauſe, 1. As the ſphere of the affaires of this World moves, the Saints are rather ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unto the wicked, then theſe to them. <hi>Thy ſeed</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham) ſhall be a ſtranger in a Land that is not theirs: and they ſhall ſerve them, and they ſhall afflict them foure hundred yeares</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 15. 13.</note>. And, 2. Though there be a ſence, wherein <hi>all things</hi> are ſaid to be theirs (the Saints,) <hi>All things are yours</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 22</note>, &amp;c. yet wicked Men are in no other ſence here ſaid to be theirs, then that, wherein <hi>Paul, Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> are ſaid to be theirs. Therefore as it doth no wayes argue, that <hi>Paul, Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> were <hi>bought</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for ſlaves, becauſe they are here ſaid to be, the Saints, <hi>i. e.</hi> for their ſervice and benefit: ſo neither doth it prove that wicked or impenitent Men were <hi>bought</hi> for ſlaves by Him, becauſe they are here ſaid to be theirs alſo, or becauſe (in ſome ſence) they are or may be ſerviceable to them.</p>

               <hi>Chriſt</hi> did <hi>buy</hi> ſome <hi>Reprobates [viz.</hi> ſuch as are ſpoken of herein, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>I. Ball</hi> Covenant of Grace, <hi>p. 238. 239.</hi>
               </note> more fully deſcribed in the Chapter;] but (ſay they) this concludes not the queſtion in Hand, unleſſe <hi>it can be ſhewed, that there is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all Reprobates. For</hi> (they ſay on) <hi>the thing to be proved, is, that Chriſt Died equally for all and every Man: And it is one thing to die for the Reprobate in ſome ſence, and to die for them with an intention and purpoſe to ſave them: and if Chriſt Died for ſome, and but ſome, that periſh in a manner not common to all and every Man, it is manifeſt He died not equally for all Men.</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:94900:85"/> How unlike Himſelfe is the Author in theſe Paſſages? or what Pen ever dropt ſuch Divinity as this, with that which followes in the ſame Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Diſcourſe, beſides? For, 1. is it reaſonable to demand a Proofe, <hi>that there is the ſame reaſon of all Reprobates [viz.</hi> in all circumſtances, or in every reſpect] to evince this, that <hi>Chriſt Died equally for them all?</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome of them be greater ſinners, and ſome leſſer, and ſufficient proofe can be made, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died for the greater ſinners amongſt them (which the Author of the ſaid paſſages plainely grants) is it a reaſonable ground of deniall that He died for the reſt, that they are leſſer ſinners then they? Or ſuppoſe there can be ten thouſand differences <hi>ſhewed</hi> between Reprobates, and Reprobates, yet if there be none of them competent to evince a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the intentions of <hi>Christ,</hi> in, or about His dying for them, they are all of them put together of no conſideration at all, to prove that <hi>Chriſt Died</hi> not <hi>equally</hi> for them; nor yet to infringe their Aſſertion, who affirme He did. As ſuppoſe ſome of them be Taylors, others Carpenters, a third part Mariners, or the like, ſuch differences as theſe, though never ſo many, are no ground, whereon to conclude, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died not <hi>equally</hi> for them all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas He makes this the ſtate of the Queſtion between Him,<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> and His Antagoniſts, whether <hi>Chriſt Died equally for all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and every Man,</hi> or no, confident I am that this is a very palpable miſtake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially if by, <hi>equally,</hi> He meanes (as meane He muſt, if He meanes to ſpeake congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the intereſt of his own Diſcourſe) intentions of procuring them by His Death the actuall injoyment of equall conveniences, equall opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, equall accommodations, in every kinde, for their reſpective Salvations. For certainly no Remonſtrant was ever diſ-ſenſed to ſuch a degree, as to hold, that <hi>Christ</hi> intended, in, or by His Death, to purchaſe any ſuch uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Divine diſpenſations in the Government of the World at the Hand of God, that all and every Man (for example) ſhould injoy a Miniſtry of the ſame Efficacy and Power, for Converſion, Edification, Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. or that all and every Man ſhould be diſpoſed of unto callings <hi>equally</hi> free from, and <hi>equally</hi> ſubject unto, Temptations, Occaſions, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſinning, &amp;c. (with twenty and ten Particulars more of like conſideration which might readily be inſtanced;) nor was ever any <hi>contra-Remonſtrant</hi> ingaged, or occaſioned by any Adverſary, to <hi>remonſtrate</hi> againſt any ſuch Opinion, as this. But the Queſtion between them touching the intentions of God, and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in His Death, was, whether God did not as truly, as really, as cordially, intend the Salvation of one Man, as another, conſidered as Men, in, or by <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death. That God in His Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall diſpenſations putteth a difference between one Mans ſpirituall oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, and anothers, doth at no hand argue any different intentions in Him towards the one, and the other, in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death, but may flow from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall other Principles, or Cauſes, as either from a different uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in Men of their originall ſtocks of Grace, or from different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications that have been made unto God by others, as in Prayer, Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp;c. in the behalf of ſome, in reſpect of others; or from different reſpects borne by God to the Parents or Forefathers of ſome, in regard of their ſignall Piety and Serviceableneſſe to His great Name in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, above others; or laſtly from the Wiſdome of God in conjunction with His Goodneſſe, in, and about the government of the World, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto which He judgeth it moſt expedient, as well for His own Glory,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94900:86"/> as for the comfort and equitable conſideration of His Saints, and ſuch as walk before Him with upright and perfect hearts, to make, or to permit all that variety and diſparity which is now ſeene in the World, in the ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences or accommodations of Men, ſome Mens Proportion and allowance in this kinde being but the <hi>Omer,</hi> and other Mens, the <hi>Ephah,</hi> which the Scripture makes ten times larger, then the other <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 16. 36</note>. From ſome, or all of theſe conſiderations, and poſſibly from ſome others, beſides theſe, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality mentioned between Men and Men, in the injoyment of the meanes of Grace, may very probably ariſe: ſo that there is not the leaſt colour of a neceſſity to reſolve it into any difference of intentions in God, in the Death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And if difference of meanes vouchſafed unto Men, would argue different intentions in God touching their reſpective Salvation, in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement made by <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death; it will be found every whit as true, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died not <hi>equally</hi> for the Elect themſelves, as that He died not <hi>equally</hi> for all Reprobates. Nay if an eſtimate be made of the Intentions of God in the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> concerning the Salvations of Men, by this Rule, it will be found that He bare more gracious intentions in the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> towards many Reprobates, and their Salvation, then towards many of the Elect, or of thoſe who in the end come to be ſaved. For nothing is more evident, then that many Periſh under greater and more excellent meanes of Salvation, then are vouchſafed unto many others, who yet are ſaved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 8: 10. and Mat. 15. 28 compared with C. 11. 10. 21, &amp;c.</note>. So that it is a reaſoning of no value, which concludeth that <hi>Chriſt Died not equally for all and every Man,</hi> becauſe <hi>all and every Man have not the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For I confeſſe I am yet to learne, where, in the Scriptures, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to die for any, for whoſe Salvation he Died not. It is true, <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died not ſo Preciſely or Adequately for the Salvation of any Man, as not to die for the obtaining of many other good things alſo for them, which are not comprehended in Salvation, <hi>formally</hi> taken: and in this ſence the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be admitted, in as much as upon this account, it amounts to no more, but this: <hi>It is one thing</hi> to ſay, <hi>that Chriſt Died for the Reprobate in ſome ſence, [i. e.</hi> for the obtaining of leſſer mercies for them,] and another, to ſay, <hi>that He died for their Salvation.</hi> I confeſſe, that theſe two Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are not formally, and every wayes the ſame, as leſſer things, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, compared only between themſelves, are not the ſame. But ſuch a ſence as this no wayes accommodates the Authors Diſcourſe. Therefore His meaning (to make him ſpeake like a Man) muſt be, that to ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died for the obtaining of ſome good things for Reprobates, may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture Principles and Grounds, ſtand, and be juſtified: but to ſay, that He Died for the Salvation of ſuch Men, cannot by theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Grounds, be evinced. But in this ſence, the ſaid diſtinction hath not yet been, nor (I believe) ever will be, in the latter member of it, made Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox or ſound, upon ſuch termes.</p>

For how, in what ſence, or with what congruity to a rationall apprehenſion, can Men be ſaid to have been <hi>bought with the Blood of Chriſt, as they taſted of the Word of Life?</hi> Surely the meaning is not, that when or whileſt <hi>they taſted of the Word of Life,</hi> they were ſo <hi>bought</hi> (I meane, <hi>with the Blood of Chriſt;</hi>) nor that this <hi>their taſting of the Word of Life,</hi> was the formall or preciſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under which <hi>Chriſt bought</hi> them (though the Particle, <hi>as,</hi> frequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports this conſideration:) As well the one, as the other, of theſe ſences, are the abhorrings of common ſence it ſelfe; and beſides, they are at enmity with the Principles of the Author relating to the buſineſſe in hand. Nor am I conſcious of any thing at all intended in the Clauſe, unleſſe (haply) this may be it; <hi>viz.</hi> that in as much <hi>as they taſted of the Word of Life,</hi> it is an argument that they were <hi>bought with Chriſts Blood; i. e.</hi> that they were Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in the Fruit and Benefit of <hi>Chriſts Death,</hi> or that the intentions of God in the Death of Chriſt extended thus far, or in this conſideration, unto them. But can it enter into any reaſonable Mans thoughts to imagine, that if this had been all, which the Holy Ghoſt intended to ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> That God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the vertue or meanes of Chriſts Death, to cauſe theſe Men to <hi>taſte of the Word of Life</hi> (eſpecially with excluſion of all intentions in Him to ſave them) that He would have expreſſed it by ſaying, that <hi>Chriſt bought them?</hi> Suppoſe a Man ſhould <hi>buy</hi> or procure ſuch a quantity of Meat and Drink for a poor captive, as were ſufficient to nouriſh him well and with good ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, two or three dayes, but ſhould intend no ſuch thing as to purchaſe his Liberty, or Redemption from captivity, will any Man call this a <hi>buying,</hi> or Redeeming of the Perſon of this Man? It is a very ſtrange thing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, with what importune, bold, and broad fac'd abſurdities, error (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) though in company and conjunction with modeſty and ſoberneſſe of judgement, will attempt an eſcape out of an exigency or ſtraite. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (to the Point in hand) evident it is (as hath been already obſerved) that the Apoſtle, in theſe words, <hi>who bought them,</hi> intends an emphaticall aggravation of the ſin of ſuch <hi>Teachers,</hi> who ſhould <hi>deny</hi> their <hi>Lord.</hi> Now if there were nothing more intended in the ſaid words, but only this, that their <hi>Lord</hi> procured this for them, that they ſhould <hi>taſte of the Word of Life,</hi> but intended nothing further, or better then this to them; this would be ſo far from aggravating the ſin mentioned, that it would rather eaſe and qualifie it. For if there was nothing purchaſed for them by the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this <hi>taſting of the Word of Life,</hi> unpoſſible it was for them to have obtained any thing more; weake and ſinfull Man being in no capacity of obtaining more good in any kinde, then what a way hath been opened for him, in, and by, the Death of Chriſt, to compaſſe. Now for a Man to <hi>taſte</hi> only <hi>of the Word of Life,</hi> and to be in no capacity of making any further progreſſe in the way of Salvation, nay, to be in no capacity of doing that, by which he might be actually ſaved, no whit bettereth or ſweeteneth any Mans conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but makes it much worſe, and much more grievous, then otherwiſe it would have been. <hi>Better it had been</hi> (ſaith our Apoſtle afterwards in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94900:87"/> ſame Chapter) <hi>for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſſe</hi> [i. e. <hi>to taſte of the Word of Life] then after they have known it, to turne from the holy Commandement delivered unto them;</hi> which yet they muſt of neceſſity doe, if they were in no capacity, under no poſſibility, of going forward, or of being ſaved. Now for a ſervant to <hi>deny,</hi> or diſclaime his <hi>Lord,</hi> in caſe he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make his condition any whit better, but in many reſpects, worſe, is a far leſſer, and lighter ſin (if any at all) then it would be to <hi>deny</hi> Him, upon a ſuppoſition that he had never done any thing at all in relation to Him, neither good, nor bad. Therefore this Author is inextricably intangled with his expoſition of the place in hand, and makes no earnings of it at all. He gives no tolerable account, how thoſe <hi>Teachers,</hi> who <hi>brought ſwift deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon themſelves,</hi> ſhould be <hi>bought by Christ inchoately only, and in a ſort,</hi> and not ſimply and abſolutely, after the ſame manner, and upon the ſame termes, that all other Men, yea, the Elect themſelves, are <hi>bought</hi> by Him.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Engliſh Annotators,</hi> taking no notice of the former Expoſition of the<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> place, as being (it ſeemes) to them inconſiderable, give us, in ſtead thereof, our choyce of two others; but both of them calculated likewiſe to ſerve the turne, not the truth. <hi>The Lord that bought them</hi>] i. e. (ſay they) <hi>that gave a price ſufficient for them. Or, by whom they profeſsed that they were Redeemed: and therefore they ſhould not have denied Him.</hi> But (for the former) we have once &amp; again razed to the ground the polluted Sanctuary of that Diſtinction, which aſſerteth <hi>Chriſts</hi> Dying <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for Men, and yet denieth His Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>intentionally</hi> for them <note n="a" place="margin">Cap 5. Sect. 39, 40. &amp;c. Again Cap. 7. Sect. 5.</note>. Beſides, here to interpret, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for the perſons ſpoken of, without ſuppoſing, that He died <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally</hi> alſo for them, is cleerly to overthrow the Apoſtles intention in the words, and to turne his aggravation of the ſin he ſpeaks of, rather into an extenuation, then otherwiſe. For he that ſhall pay that for the eaſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit only of another, which was <hi>ſufficient</hi> to have pleaſured and eaſed me alſo, as well as him, and yet ſhall neglect me in ſuch a payment, and leave me in miſery, when as he might, without the leaſt trouble or charge to himſelf, above what he underwent upon another account, have relieved me, hath no cauſe to expect ſervice, or thanks from me, for ſuch a payment: but I am the more excuſeable if I neglect him, or refuſe to own him as a friend, becauſe he neglected me in my greateſt extremity, and that when he had ſuch a faire opportunity, of a miſerable, to have made me an happy Man, and might have done it without the leaſt inconvenience to himſelf, more then what he voluntarily put himſelf upon for the ſake of others, to whom he was no whit more beholding, or ingaged, then unto me. It is a palpably-importune and ſenceleſſe conceit, to think that men are engaged in any bands of thankfulneſſe, or ſervice, unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> for dying <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for them, unleſſe He <hi>died intentionally</hi> alſo.</p>

               <hi>ſwift damnation upon themſelves,</hi> is ſaid to be, their <hi>denying the Lord that bought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them.</hi> If then they <hi>denied this Lord that bought them,</hi> how can theſe Expoſitors ſay, that they <hi>profeſſed</hi> themſelves <hi>bought</hi> by Him? If it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, they might formerly <hi>profeſſe</hi> themſelves <hi>bought</hi> by Him, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they <hi>denied</hi> Him; and the Apoſtle may charge them with ſin in their preſent <hi>deniall</hi> of him, upon the account of their former <hi>profeſsion;</hi> I anſwer: that if formerly they <hi>profeſſed</hi> themſelves <hi>bought</hi> by him, but were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo <hi>bought,</hi> and afterwards coming to underſtand or apprehend the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were not ſo <hi>bought,</hi> they are not at all to be blamed for <hi>deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> themſelves to have been <hi>bought</hi> by him, or for <hi>denying</hi> that he <hi>bought</hi> them. To <hi>deny</hi> that to be ſo, which is not ſo, eſpecially when a Man verily believes and apprehends it not to be, is no Mans ſin. Or if it be further pleaded (in favour of the ſaid gloſſe) that theſe <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> might at the ſame time, when they <hi>profeſſed</hi> themſelves <hi>bought by Chriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, deny</hi> him, <hi>viz.</hi> in a conſequentiall way, as either by teaching ſuch hereticall Doctrines, which overthrew his God-head, Man-hood, &amp;c. or elſe by an impious converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I anſwer, 1. That if they <hi>profeſſed</hi> themſelves <hi>bought</hi> by him, they could not lightly teach or hold forth any Doctrine, wherein they ſhould <hi>deny,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his God-head, Man-hood, Satisfaction, or any other thing relating to him, without which he could not, in a rationall way, have made ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of them. Or, 2. If they did teach any ſuch Doctrine, it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they did it unwittingly, and becauſe they apprehended nothing in it of any inconſiſtency with their <hi>profeſsion</hi> of being <hi>bought by Chriſt.</hi> For it is not to be thought that Men will willingly and knowingly teach contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, or teach any opinion, which they apprehend contradictory to what they daily profeſſe to believe. Now for a Man unwittingly, and contrary to his intention and deſire, to teach ſuch a Doctrine, which conſequently involves, or leads unto an opinion that is dangerous and <hi>damnable,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is incident to the beſt and moſt approved <hi>Teachers</hi> (as I could readily demonſtrate by many inſtances) and therefore not like to be a ſin of ſuch high provocation, as to <hi>bring ſwift damnation upon them.</hi> But, 3. (and laſtly) that the Apoſtle doth not ſpeake of any ſuch <hi>deniall</hi> of the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> by theſe <hi>falſe Teachers,</hi> which is by <hi>workes,</hi> or by wickedneſſe of life and converſation, but of Doctrine, is evident enough by the expreſſe tenor and carriage of the words themſelves. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, even as there ſhall be falſe Teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies, even denying,</hi> &amp;c. which cleerly ſheweth, that the <hi>deniall of the Lord</hi> here charged upon <hi>falſe Teachers,</hi> ſtood not in works, but in words, in falſe, Hereticall, and <hi>damnable</hi> Teachings. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not, they cannot be here ſaid to have been <hi>bought by Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they <hi>profeſsed themſelves</hi> to have been <hi>redeemed by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some to evade that mortall ſtroke, which the Scripture in hand reacheth<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> to that opinion, which denieth a poſſibility of periſhing in thoſe, who are truly <hi>bought</hi> and Redeemed <hi>by Chriſt,</hi> not being ſatisfied with any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer come-offs, have deviſed this. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſay they) is ſaid to have <hi>bought</hi> theſe <hi>falſe Teachers,</hi> not becauſe he really, indeed and in truth <hi>bought</hi> them, but becauſe in the opinion and judgement of Men he had <hi>bought</hi> them: they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94900:88"/> were looked upon as perſons Redeemed and <hi>bought</hi> by Him. And to credit this Interpretation, they alledge ſeverall Texts, where things, or perſons are ſaid to be ſo, or ſo, ſuch or ſuch, not becauſe they were really that, which they are ſaid to be, but only becauſe they were this in appearance, or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common eſtimate of Men. As <hi>Mat. 9. 13. Joh. 9. 39. Mat.</hi> 13. 12. com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ed with <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 18. But this colour is as faint, as any of the former, and as eaſily waſhed off. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is very queſtionable, whether in any of theſe places, either things or perſons receive any denomination meerly from appearance, or opinion of Men. Many things might be argued, and that with much probability, <hi>in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum.</hi> But concerning the firſt of the places, moſt certaine it is that there is no ſuch notion to be found there. For that by the <hi>righteous,</hi> whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith that he <hi>came not to call to Repentance,</hi> ſhould be meant, <hi>righteous</hi> only in ſhew, or in the opinion of Men, whether themſelves, or others, and not <hi>righteous</hi> truly and properly ſo called, contradicts the manifeſt and declared intentions of <hi>Christs</hi> comming into the World, which are frequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched and found to be, the <hi>calling</hi> of ſinners of all ſorts, kinds, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, <hi>unto Repentance;</hi> and therefore of Hypocrites alſo, as well as others, and of perſons conceited in the higheſt of their own Righteouſneſſe. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7, 8. &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14, 15. compared with <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 6, 7, &amp;c. (to omit many other places of like import.) Beſides, the occaſion, and tendency of our Saviours Words, are of pregnant eviction, that by, <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> he meanes perſons truly ſuch, and not in conceit, or opinion only. He was charged as with matter of undue deportment, in eating with Publicans and Sinners. For his juſtification he pleads, that <hi>the whole have no need of a Phyſician, but the ſick;</hi> meaning that as the <hi>calling</hi> of the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> is no wayes neceſſary, in reſpect of thoſe that are ſtrong, healthfull, and ſound, but only of the <hi>ſick;</hi> ſo neither had His comming into the World been of any ſuch neceſſity, as now it was, but for ſinners; and that had Men been <hi>righteous</hi> and ſpiritually ſound, there had been no need of His comming unto them. And therefore as a <hi>Phyſician</hi> is not to be blamed for converſing with the <hi>ſick,</hi> in as much as the nature and end of his calling requires his preſence with them, and not with thoſe that are ſound: ſo neither was he to be blamed for being in the company of <hi>ſinners,</hi> ſeeing the great end and intent of his <hi>calling</hi> to the Office of a Saviour, was not to ſave, or to be helpfull unto, ſuch as were <hi>righteous,</hi> who upon ſuch an account ſtood in no need of him, but to adminiſter comfort and help unto ſinners, who without help from him muſt needs periſh. Now certaine it is, that the <hi>righteous,</hi> whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares unto the <hi>whole,</hi> who in that reſpect <hi>need no Phyſician,</hi> are not men <hi>righteous</hi> in ſhew, or in opinion only, for theſe ſtand in as much, or more, need of the Phyſician, then others; but thoſe that are truly and ſincerely <hi>righteous.</hi> Therefore this Scripture holds no intelligence with that interpretation of the other, which is now under cenſure. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be it granted for truth, that things and perſons ſometimes receive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> only from an appearance of what they are called, or from the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Men judging them ſuch; yet ſuch a line of interpretation as this, is not to be ſtretched over what Scriptures we pleaſe; nor indeed over any, but where the manifeſt exigency of the Context calls for it. Otherwiſe we ſhall entitle Men to a liberty, of ſubſtituting ſhadowes and appearances only, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of realities and ſubſtances of Truth, where, and when they pleaſe: and ſo to turne the Minde and Counſells of God in the Scriptures upſide down.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94900:89"/> The Conteſt of old between <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Austine</hi> about <hi>Pauls</hi> reproving <hi>Peter (Gal.</hi> 2.) is of notable conſideration to the buſineſſe in hand. <hi>Hierome</hi> pleaded, that when <hi>Paul</hi> reproved <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> he did it not ſeriouſly, or in good earneſt: but affirmed, that theſe two Apoſtles out of a kinde of prudent Charity agreed to make a ſhew of a Conteſt between them, when as indeed there was none. But how gravely, and copiouſly doth <hi>Austin</hi> declare againſt, and argue down, ſuch a licentiouſneſſe of interpreting? <hi>The Scripture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>plainely ſaith, that Peter was worthy reproofe,</hi> or to be condemned. <hi>If then we ſhall take this liberty,</hi> (or boldneſſe) <hi>to ſay, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and in truth he did not amiſſe, but only diſſembled for the ſake of thoſe that were weake, then the Apostle Paul lyes, in ſaying, that he was worthy blame, or reproofe. Admit this</hi> (ſaith this learned Father) <hi>and down falls all the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and certainty of the Scriptures</hi>

And if there be ſome places, which will beare, or which call for ſuch a figurative and Catacreſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Interpretation as this, they are but few: and thoſe which are, muſt be diſcerned and diſtinguiſhed from others, by the manifeſt exigency of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſcopes and imports; the leaſt jot or title of which character is not to be found in the place in hand. For,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) moſt evident it is (as hath been formerly alſo obſerved,<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> and as many Expoſitors, more then enough addicted to the contra-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant opinion, themſelves acknowledge) that the Apoſtles intent here is, to ſet forth the moſt hainous and horrid indignity of the ſin of theſe <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> in <hi>denying</hi> their <hi>Lord,</hi> by this aggravating conſideration, that they <hi>deny</hi> ſuch a <hi>Lord</hi> who <hi>bought them.</hi> Now if it be ſuppoſed that this <hi>Lord,</hi> really, and of love and good will to them, and out of a deſire to free them from miſery, <hi>bought,</hi> or redeemed them, the conſideration is of great preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy and force to demonſtrate horrible ingratitude and impiety in them, to <hi>deny</hi> Him. But if on the contrary it be ſuppoſed, that he did not indeed <hi>buy</hi> them with any intent to free them from their miſery, but only make a ſhew of ſuch a thing, or only do that, which might occaſion Men to think, or to believe that he did ſo, this manifeſtly eaſeth and qualifies the guilt of their ſin in <hi>denying</hi> him; and ſo is manifeſtly repugnant to the Apoſtles ſcope. For, to make a <hi>ſhew</hi> of love only, or to doe that, by which other Men may be invited to think, that a reall kindneſſe is done for ſuch, or ſuch a Man, when as indeed there is nothing done of any ſuch conſideration, nor ever intended to be done, doth no wayes oblige this Man in thankfulneſſe unto him, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates him upon no better terms, but is rather a juſt ground of an harder and worſe opinion of him.</p>
            <p>If it be replied; yea but theſe <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> knew nothing but that they<note place="margin">§. 39.</note> were truly and really <hi>bought</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that out of a deſire of ſaving them: nor had they any ſufficient reaſon to judge otherwiſe. Therefore their ſin in denying him is no wayes eaſed upon this account, that he did not indeed buy them with any ſuch intent, or deſire, becauſe, 1. Men are bound to judge, as they have reaſon to judge: and, 2. are bound to act or practiſe according to their judgements; I anſwer;</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:94900:89"/>
            <p>There can be no ſufficient ground for any Man to believe that which is falſe, nor ought ſuch a thing to be believed; at leaſt with confidence of belief, or with any ſuch belief, upon which he ſhall ſtand bound to ingage in any material and weighty Action, or Practiſe. Therefore if <hi>Christ</hi> did not really <hi>buy</hi> theſe <hi>falſe Teachers,</hi> they could have no ſufficient ground to believe that he did; at leaſt to believe at any ſuch rate of confidence, as rather to ſuffer the loſſe of any conſiderable good, then <hi>deny</hi> it. If it be againe replied; A Man may ſtand bound to adventure much upon probabilities, in many caſes, though there be no certainty, or truth in that, which upon ſuch probabilities he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; I anſwer, poſſibly a Man may indeed ſtand bound, in point of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or prudence, in ſome caſes to adventure much (in a ſimple conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) upon probabilities only; but not in point of Conſcience. As for example; a Merchant, or other Man, may ſtand bound in point of wiſdom to adventure ſome conſiderable part of his ſtate in a way of Trade beyond the Seas, upon probabilities only of a gainfull returne; though even in this caſe, upon a more exact conſideration it will appeare, that ſuch a Man doth not make, this adventure upon any meere probability, one, or more, but upon that which is certaine. For the probability of a good returne in this caſe, is a certainty to him: he knowes certainly, and beyond all doubt or queſtion, that it is a thing probable or likely, that he ſhall receive ſuch a returne, though he knowes not certainly, but only probably, that he ſhall indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. Now the true ground upon which the Merchant adventures, is not the knowledge that he ſhall, or will gaine by his adventure: for it is unpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to know this: but the knowledge and conſideration of the likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of his gaining, which (as hath been ſaid) he may, and doth know, and that certainly.</p>
            <p>You will upon this ſay (it is like) The <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> (in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">§. 40.</note> in hand) had, or might have had, ſuch a certainty as this, that the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> did really <hi>buy</hi> them: for it was very probable that he had ſo bought them, in regard of that illumination, externall ſanctification, and other gifts, whereof they were partakers; and conſequently their ſin in <hi>denying</hi> him was never the leſſe upon any ſuch account as this, that he had not indeed <hi>bought</hi> them: in as much as they were bound to believe that he had ſo <hi>bought</hi> them, and to behave themſelves towards him accordingly. I anſwer: 1. Upon this ſuppoſition, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not indeed <hi>buy,</hi> or had not <hi>bought</hi> them, they could have no probability, no not upon their illumination, or outward gifts whatſoever, that he had, or ſhould have, ſo <hi>bought</hi> them; eſpecially tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the opinion of thoſe, againſt whom we manage our preſent Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> truly <hi>bought</hi> no more, then come to be actually ſaved. For, 1. if thoſe truly <hi>bought</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> be but very few in number, comparatively, with thoſe, who were paſſed by, and not ſo <hi>bought</hi> by him, then no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Man, thus far, (I meane, as he is a member of Man-kinde, or one of the generality of Men) can have ſo much as a probable ground, that he is one of thoſe ſo bought by him. As when there are twenty, or fourty blanks in a Lottery, and only one prize, it is not probable or likely that he that draweth but once, ſhall draw the prize. For it is twenty or fourty to one that he ſhall not draw it. 2. Neither doth the receiving of illumination, or any other common gift, upon the former ſuppoſalls, make it probable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Man, that <hi>Chriſt truly bought him,</hi> becauſe very many receive illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (at leaſt in the ſence of our oppoſers) &amp;c. who live wickedly; and many alſo, who fall away from that externall ſanctity, wherein they walked
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94900:90"/> for a ſeaſon. And our Saviour himſelf ſaith, <hi>that many are called, but few are choſen</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 20. 16</note>; and againe, that upon the <hi>abounding of iniquity, [viz.</hi> in fierce and bloody Perſecutors] <hi>the love of many ſhall wax cold</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 24 12</note>: and yet again, that <hi>many that are firſt, ſhall be laſt</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 19. 30</note>, (to omit many other paſſages of like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.)

            <p>But how weake this allegation is, ſufficiently appeares by the foundation, on which it is built, which is this, that Parables or Similitudes run upon all foure; or that all things whatſoever found in the things reſembling, are appliable alſo to the things reſembled. God in hearing the importunate and reſtleſſe cries of his Saints, is compared to an <hi>unrighteous Judge,</hi> who though <hi>neither fearing God, nor regarding Man,</hi> was notwithſtanding overcome with <hi>the Widows</hi> importunity, to doe her Juſtice.

Of no whit better calculation is that collection mentioned; wherein, becauſe Men, ſometimes cleane, and afterwards pollut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are compared, in reſpect of ſuch a change, to a <hi>Dog returning to his vomit, and a waſhed Sow, to her wallowing in the mire;</hi> it is argued, that therefore during their cleanneſſe, they muſt needs be inwardly, and in diſpoſition, like unto theſe Creatures. Beſides, ſuppoſing the Perſons here ſpoken of, to have been <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Swine,</hi> I meane, inwardly uncleane and impure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the alteration here aſcribed to them, the Proverb of the <hi>Dog re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his vomit,</hi> &amp;c. may, in ſufficient Propriety of Speech, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto them, without any ſuppoſall, that under that alteration they ſhould be <hi>Dogs</hi> alſo. Suppoſe a Dog ſhould by caſting up his gorge, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, be turned into a Sheep, and afterwards ſhould by a contrary meanes, <hi>viz.</hi> by reſuming it, become a Dog again, might it not Truly and Properly enough be ſaid, that this Dog, though lately a Sheep, is now become a Dog again? But the impertinency of the Plea now impleaded, may be any Mans Viſion, that will but narrowly and impartially looke upon it. Yea,</p>

            <pb n="148" facs="tcp:94900:93"/>
            <p>Another Scripture ranged in the ſame Diviſion with the former, is of much<note place="margin">§. 50.</note> the ſame conſideration with them. <hi>Of how much ſorer puniſhment</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foote the Sonne of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 10. 29</note>? To ſay, that this Scripture (with the former) doth not ſpeak of a true and reall Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but of that only, which is outſidely, ſeemingly, and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſuch, is to claime a meere Arbitrary Power for Interpreting the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>For, 1. The word here tranſlated, <hi>Sanctification,</hi> is the ſame, with that which our Saviour uſeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 17. where, in the behalf of His Diſciples, He Prayeth thus unto His Father: <hi>Sanctifie them through thy Truth: thy Word is the Truth.</hi> If neither Reaſon, nor Religion ſuffereth us here to interpret, that <hi>Christ</hi> Prayed unto the Father to <hi>Sanctifie</hi> His Diſciples, outwardly, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, ſeemingly only, but really and in truth, I would gladly know which of the two, or whether both, lead us to underſtand any other <hi>Sanctification,</hi> in the Place in Hand.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No one inſtance (I verily believe) can be brought throughout all the Scripture, where Men are ſaid to be <hi>Sanctified</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> by the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> or the like; but that the Place is to be underſtood, of a true, ſound, and ſaving <hi>Sanctification.</hi> But Places of this Interpretation are many, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 2. 1 Cor. 6. 11. Eph. 5. 25, 26. Heb.</hi> 13. 12. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is this reaſon evincing with an high Hand that the Scripture before us ſpeaketh of an inward, reall, and ſoule Sanctification, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſin of the Perſon here ſaid to have been <hi>Sanctified,</hi> in <hi>counting the Blood of the Covenant an unholy thing [i. e.</hi> in Deſpiſing or Prophaning it] is aggravated by this conſideration, that He was <hi>Sanctified</hi> by it. The carriage of the Verſe, cleerly, and above all contradiction, evinceth this. Now then if we ſhall ſuppoſe that this Perſon had received no more good, no greater benefit by this <hi>Blood of the Covenant,</hi> but only to be made an Hypocrite, or a Diſſembler by it (which muſt be affirmed, if the <hi>Sanctification</hi> here attributed unto Him, be only a feigned, or formall <hi>Sanctification;</hi>) this is ſo far from aggravating that ſin of His in deſpiſing it, that it doth very much, if not altogether, extenuate and excuſe it.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be here pretended (with reaſon) that it was not the fault,<note place="margin">§. 51.</note> nor any defect in <hi>the blood of the Covenant,</hi> that he was not truly and really ſanctified, but his own negligence and falſeneſſe of Heart. For though it be true, that the Reaſon why any Man, eſpecially injoying the Goſpell, Proves an Hypocrite, is not any deficiency in <hi>the Blood</hi> there Preſented unto Him by way of antidote, and for his cleanſing, but his own negligence, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe to his own Soule; yet the <hi>Sanctification</hi> ſpoken of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Hand, is not attributed to the Looſeneſſe or Hollow-heartedneſſe of the Perſon, in whom it was found, but to <hi>the Blood of the Covenant</hi> it ſelfe. Now that which is the Proper and genuine effect of this blood, cannot be any Hypocriticall, or meere outſide thing. And however, were this <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> an Hypocriticall, or meere-outſide thing, and ſo an occaſionall effect only of the <hi>blood of the Covenant;</hi> yet would the conſideration hereof be no juſt or fitting matter, whereby to aggravate the ſin of him that ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe this Blood. Though I may be guilty, and an offender in an high degree, to remaine an Hypocrite, or a falſe-hearted Man, under meanes ſo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94900:93"/> and Proper to make me ſound and upright Hearted, as the Goſpell, and <hi>the Blood of the Covenant</hi> held forth therein, are; yet the conſideration of my remaining an Hypocrite in this caſe, is no ground why I ſhould be judged, either by my ſelf, or others, the greater ſinner, for deſpiſing theſe meanes. It is rather an extenuation (as hath been ſaid) of my ſin in this kinde, then otherwiſe, to conſider, that though this Blood of the Covenant be a very Efficacious and Proper meanes to make me ſound-Hearted and ſincere, yet it is not ſo Efficacious and Powerfull in this kinde, as actually to ſubdue and overcome the Hypocriſie and Wickedneſſe of my Soule, without mine own endevours in concurrence with it. Therefore certainly the Apoſtle would never inſtance in a counterfeit, unſound, or imperfect <hi>Sanctification,</hi> wrought, or occaſioned by <hi>the blood of the Covenant,</hi> to aggravate the ſin of ſuch a Perſon, who ſhould deſpiſe it, by Apoſtatizing from the Profeſſion of it. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) ſuppoſe the Scripture in Hand ſhould be conceived to ſpeak of an outward formall <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which conſiſts in a civill or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Reformation of the outer Man (which yet the ſcope of the Place, will at no hand, as hath been argued, admit) yet it ſufficiently reacheth in Point of Proof, that which is intended from it, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died for thoſe that Periſh. For this <hi>Sanctification,</hi> of what kinde ſoever it be, be it ſhadow, or be it ſubſtance, is aſcribed <hi>to the Blood of the Covenant (i. e.</hi> the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wherein God covenanteth Life and Salvation unto the World upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving) as the efficient cauſe or means of it. Therefore this Blood howſoever was ſhed for thoſe that may, and do Periſh.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid; it's true, it was ſhed for ſuch Men, with ſuch an intent on<note place="margin">§. 52.</note> Gods Part as this, that they ſhould be externally cleanſed by it, and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanctified, but not that they ſhould be really and internally <hi>Sanctified,</hi> or <hi>in fine</hi> ſaved by it; I anſwer, 1. That the ſtrength of this Objection hath been already troden down in this <hi>Chapter</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Sect. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 30, &amp;c.</note>. 2. I here add, that if God intended an externall <hi>Sanctification</hi> only by the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> for the Perſons menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Objection, then were His intentions in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to theſe Men, rather grievous, then gracious; bent upon the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and increaſe of their condemnation, not upon the advance of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf ſhould <hi>come</hi> unto them, not that they <hi>might have life more abundantly,</hi> but that they might have Hell and Death <hi>more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly;</hi> whereas moſt certaine it is, <hi>that God ſent not His Sonne into the World to condemne the World,</hi> much leſſe to increaſe the <hi>condemnation of the World, but that the World,</hi> that is (as we formerly made good the interpretation <note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 5. Sect. 10. 15, &amp;c.</note>) the generality of Men, <hi>might be ſaved.</hi> 3. (and laſtly) If <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died for theſe Men to inveſt them with an externall <hi>Sanctification,</hi> to make them outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy, I would know, whether, together with this outward <hi>Sanctification,</hi> He did intend to Procure for them by His Death an inward Principle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to it, out of which it ſhould flow. If ſo, if He did intend to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by His Death an inward ſuitable Principle for theſe Men, out of which that outward Sanctification ſhould flow, then certainly He did intend to Procure them a true and reall Sanctification. For what can we imagine a true and reall Sanctification ſhould be more, then a righteous, blameleſſe, innocent and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Converſation iſſuing from an inward Principle ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it? If it be ſaid, no; <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not intend by His Death to Procure for theſe Men any ſuch inward Principle, as you ſpeake of, but only that outward conformity to the Wayes and Lawes of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, then
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94900:94"/> it will follow that <hi>Christ</hi> Died with an intention to make Men Hypocrites, or to Procure Hypocriſie for Men. Becauſe a faire ſhew in outward Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Religious deportments, without an inward Principle and frame of Heart anſwerable to them, and which ariſeth out of an hollow and unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Heatt, is Hypocriſie, and that in the Plaineſt and moſt obvious ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Word. Therefore certainly <hi>Christ</hi> did not ſhed His Blood to Purchaſe any ſuch <hi>Sanctification</hi> for Men, which ſome conceive to be meant in the Scripture in hand. <hi>Christ</hi> in Dying for Men intended nothing for Men, but that which is true, reall, and ſaving, in the Nature and Proper tendency of it. Intentions of making Men hypocrites, or <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by halves, in one kinde or other, are more fitting for Satan, then for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> How little danger there is, or rather what Precious advantage there is for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Peace, and Edification of true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Soules, in that Interpretation of this Place, which by <hi>Sanctification,</hi> underſtands a true and reall Sanctification, above any thing that is in the contrary, we ſhall (God willing) demonſtrate in the next <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time I deſire the Reader will pleaſe to underſtand this, that<note place="margin">§. 53.</note> the interpretation aſſerted, and which underſtands the Scripture in hand of a true and reall <hi>Sanctification,</hi> is no ſlip of Remonſtrantiſme, but atteſted by very Orthodox Men (as the word now ruleth:) <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelfe writeth nothing upon the Place, but of good accord with it. <hi>By a compariſon of the benefits</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of what Men received by <hi>Moſes</hi> under the Law, and what <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now under the Goſpell receive by <hi>Chriſt) he aggravates the ingratitude of Men.

The paſſages now to be inſiſted upon lie in the Body of a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is ſomewhat large: the Reader may pleaſe to peruſe the whole in the Evangeliſt. The Particulars in it for our Purpoſe, are contained in theſe words. <hi>Then His Lord, after He had called Him, ſaid unto Him; O thou wicked ſervant, I forgave thee all the debt, becauſe thou deſiredst Me: Should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not thou alſo have had compaſsion on thy fellow-ſervant, even as I had pity on thee? And His Lord was wroth, and delivered Him to the Tormentors, till He ſhould pay all that was due to Him. So likewiſe ſhall my Heavenly Father doe alſo unto you, if yee from your Hearts forgive not every one His Brother their Treſpaſſes.</hi> In theſe words we heare of a <hi>Servant</hi> to whim his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had freely forgiven all that debt, which he owed unto Him, which (as we finde in the former part of the Parable) was a vaſt ſum of <hi>ten thouſand Talents</hi> (fit to typifie or repreſent that great debt of eternall ſufferings, which every Man owes for <hi>Sinnes</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſſes,</hi> unto God:) And yet we hear alſo that this ſame Servant, by provoking this gracious Lord and Maſter of His, by unmercifulneſſe and cruelty to one of his fellow-ſervants, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his former Grace and Mercy, which he had received from Him in the forgiveneſſe of his great debt, and that this forfeiture was taken by His Lord, and he delivered by Him to the Tormentors, or Priſon-keepers, <hi>untill He ſhould pay the whole debt,</hi> i. e. for ever, in as much as <hi>He had not,</hi> nor was ever able to procure, wherewith <hi>to make</hi> ſuch a <hi>payment.</hi> What was intended and ſignified by all this, is cleerly expreſſed by our Saviour in thoſe laſt words, which containe the application, and are the cloſe of the Parable: <hi>So likewiſe ſhall my Heavenly Father,</hi> &amp;c. From which words the cleer and direct ſcope and intent of the Parable ſheweth it ſelf to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> to give the World to know and underſtand, that if Men, who have obtained forgiveneſſe of ſins by the meanes and Grace of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhall ſo far ſin againſt the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and richneſſe of this Grace, as to deale cruelly and unmercifully by Men, this act of Grace towards them ſhall be cancelled and revoked, and the debt of their ſins ſhall returne and recoyle againe upon them. Yea, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells his Diſciples themſelves (for this Parable was in ſpeciall manner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected unto them, as appears from the beginning of the Chapter) that they themſelves muſt not looke to be exempted from this Law of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and equity of God. <hi>So likewiſe ſhall my Heavenly Father doe alſo unto you,</hi> or, even unto you (notwithſtanding any Priviledge you may ſeeme to have above other Men, by being My Diſciples;) he will neither deale better nor worſe with you, but juſt as this Lord did by that wretched and moſt unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Servant of his, if you Provoke him after the ſame manner, <hi>i. e. if yee from your Hearts forgive not every one His Brother their Treſpaſſes.</hi> That great Grace of forgiveneſſe of ſins, under which you now ſtand, will be reverſed and called in again, by him that hath given it you, if you ſhall ſo far tread and trample the glory of it under your feet, as not in conſideration and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the greatneſſe of it, to be open and free-hearted in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another ſuch Injuries and Treſpaſſes, as are done to you. This is the righteous and royall way of that God with the World, <hi>who</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) <hi>without reſpect of Perſons judgeth according to every Mans work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not need (I ſuppoſe) to caution that which hath been delivered<note place="margin">§. 55.</note> upon this account, with any ſuch <hi>Item</hi> or Explication, as this; that it was far from our Saviours intent to threaten, either his Apoſtles, or any other
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94900:95"/> Man, that they ſhould incur the ſore judgement mentioned, the loſſe of the forgiveneſſe of ſins, or be caſt into the Priſon of hell, by every paſſionate or ſudden heat conceived againſt a Man upon a Provocation, or Offence given. If this were ſo, the whole World of Saints (in a manner) might cry out, as the Apoſtles, upon occaſion of another Doctrine taught by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi> But his meaning clearly was, and is, that if they ſhould harbour or nouriſh thoughts or deſires of revenge againſt any Man, that ſhould at any time offend or injure them, and remaine impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, not admitting of a clear and cordiall reconciliation with him, and ſhould live and die in this hatefull and revengefull Poſture, that then God would deale no better with them, then the Lord in the Parable did by that Servant, to whom he had forgiven a great debt, upon his unmercifull dealing by his fellow ſervant, when <hi>He delivered Him to the Tormentors to be cast into Priſon, untill He ſhould pay the whole debt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor doth any thing that hath been aſſerted concerning the returne of the<note place="margin">§. 56.</note> debt of ſin upon any Man, after forgiveneſſe, upon occaſion of cruell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull, and revengefull dealings by their Brethren, beare at all upon that of the Apoſtle: <hi>the gifts and calling of God are without Repentance</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 11. 29.</note>. For the meaning hereof is not, that what God once gives, he never takes away: we know there are inſtances in the Scripture without number to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

The Phraſe only imports a purpoſe of heart in God ſhortly to deſtroy him from off the face of the Earth for his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as he ſaith (immediately after) that he would do. For which kinde of expreſſion, when attributed unto God, we have accounted at large in the third Chapter of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The gifts and calling of God,</hi> are, or may be ſaid to be, <hi>without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 58.</note> becauſe, let Men continue the ſame Perſons (I meane, Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, or Proportionably the ſame) which they were, when the donation, or collation of any <hi>gift</hi> was firſt made by God unto them, he never chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or altereth his diſpenſation towards them, unleſſe it be for the better, or in order to their further good: in which caſe he cannot be ſaid to <hi>repent</hi> of what he had <hi>given.</hi> But in caſe Men ſhall change and alter from what they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94900:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> were, when God firſt dealt graciouſly and bountifully by them, eſpecially if they ſhall notoriouſly degenerate, or caſt away that principle, or through negligence, or otherwiſe, deveſt and deſpoile themſelves of that very quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, on which, God (as it were) graffed his benefit or <hi>guift</hi> vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to them; in this caſe, though he recalls and takes away his <hi>guift,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to <hi>repent</hi> of the <hi>giving it,</hi> becauſe the terms upon which he gave it, pleaſe him ſtill; only the perſons to whom he gave it, and who pleaſed him when he gave it unto them, have now rendered themſelves by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe, diſpleaſing unto him, and uncapable, by the Lawes and Rule, of his righteous diſpenſations, of any further injoyment thereof. This is the caſe between God, and ſuch Men, who having once obtained remiſſion of ſins from him by ſuch a <hi>Faith, which wrought,</hi> or was apt and ready to work, <hi>by love,</hi> afterwards upon the loſſe or degeneration of this Faith, together with the operativeneſſe of contrary and vile principles, are deveſted by him of that great and glorious priviledge, and fall back into their former eſtate of condemnation.</p>
            <p>Therefore from thoſe quarters of the Parable in <hi>Matthew</hi> which we have<note place="margin">§. 59.</note> lately ſurveyed, perfect intelligence comes, that perſons, who have by meanes of a ſound Faith received remiſſion of ſins upon the account of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death, may through negligence in not preſerving this Faith, or the ſweetneſſe and ſoundneſſe of it, ſo far provoke their glorious Benefactor, as to cauſe him to repeale that His Act of Grace towards them, and to ſuffer their former guilt to returne, like the uncleane ſpirit with ſeven worſe then himſelf, upon them. From whence it undeniably followes, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purchaſed Remiſſion of ſins by His Death for thoſe, who notwithſtanding may through their own folly and wickedneſſe periſh. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> interprets the place in full conſonancy with this inference or ſuppoſition. <hi>Although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the graces and guifts of God are without Repentance, yet malice</hi> [or, wickedneſſe] <hi>prevailed ſo far, as to diſſolve this Law.

In this reſpect, being little leſſe then neceſſitated for the ſecuring of ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages (in the former Chapter) very materiall for the carrying on the maine deſigne of this Diſcourſe, to ingage a little about the Doctrine of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I conceive it beſt, in my entrance hereupon, to remove this ſtumbling ſtone out of the way, and to demonſtrate, not only that this Doctrine hath every whit as faire and full a conſiſtency with the Peace and Comfort of the Saints, as that contrary to it, but that of the two it is of a far better and more healthful complexion to make a Nurſe for them. When we have cleared the innocency and inoffenſiveneſſe of it in reſpect of the Peace and Comfort of Men, and ſo ſhall have reconciled it unto their affections, it will be no great maſtery (I conceive) to gaine in their judgements unto it afterwards. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I muſt crave leave (the truth, and deere intereſt of the precious Soules<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> of Men ſo commanding me) to ſay and to affirme, that the Doctrine of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance ſo much magnified amongſt us, as it is comonly taught, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is, in the nature and proper tendency of it, very obſtructive, yea and deſtructive, unto the true peace, and ſound comfort of Soules. For if we ſhall diligently inquire after the common and ordinary cauſes of thoſe doubts and feares ſo incident to Profeſſors of Religion, as alſo of thoſe extreme bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and ragings of Conſcience, wherewith both ſuch perſons, and others, are ſometimes moſt grievouſly handled and tormented, we ſhall finde them, if not univerſally, yet generally and with very few caſes of exception, to be theſe (with their fellowes, negligence and ſlothfullneſſe in watching over their hearts and wayes, omiſſion of known duties, formality in ſervices, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſſe in their courſe and callings, non-proficiency in Grace; and eſpecially the frequent prevailings &amp; breakings out of baſe corruptions, vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94900:97" rendition="simple:additions"/> noyſome luſts, &amp;c. Therefore what Doctrine ſoever, is, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Frame and Conſtitution of it, apt to lead men into ſuch ſnares of Death, to fill their conſciences with the guilt of ſuch Unchriſtian miſdemeanours, as theſe, muſt needs carry a ſtrong antipathy in it, and be full of enmity againſt the inward Peace and Comforts of their deer ſoules. And what Doctrine lightly can there be of a more apparant and notorious tendency this way, then that which promiſeth unto Men, and that with heigth of aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, under what looſeneſſe, or vile practiſes ſoever, exemption and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from that puniſhment, the feare and dread whereof is the ſtrongeſt and ſharpeſt bridle, which God Himſelf hath to put into the lips of the unruly fleſh in Men, to reſtraine it from ſin; yea and which, the ſtrength and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it notwithſtanding, the fleſh many times deſpiſeth and laughs to ſcorn, and diſdains to be reclaimed or held in by it? And is not that Doctrin of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, comonly taught and believed amongſt us, of this very calculation, tendency, and import?</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, yea but they who teach the Doctrine of perſeverance, teach<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> withall, yea urge and preſſe the neceſſity of the uſe of ſuch meanes, which God hath appointed to inable Men to perſevere; I anſwer, It is in vaine to perſwade or preſſe Men unto the uſe of ſuch meanes in any kinde, which are in themſelves diſtaſtfull and unpleaſing unto them, when they are aſcertained and ſecured before hand, that they ſhall not faile of the end howſoever, whether they uſe ſuch means, or no.</p>
            <p>If it be replied; that the Teachers I ſpeak of, do not promiſe perſeverance in Faith unto the end, but only unto thoſe, who ſhall uſe the meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God for the obtaining of it; I anſwer, if this indeed be the tenor of their Doctrine, mine, and theirs, are no more two, but one and the ſame. I am as willing and free, as the moſt zealous of them in their way, to give that great Pledge of Heaven, the Word of the living God, unto the Saints, to ſecure them of their ſtanding unto the end, upon the uſe of the meanes which God hath preſcribed in order thereunto. But I feare this is not the clear and ſimple tenour of their Doctrine we now ſpeak of: they blind it with ſome ſuch additionall ingredient as this, that as God requires the uſe of the meanes of perſeverance at the hand of the Saints, and will give it unto none but thoſe, who ſhall uſe them; yet he hath certainly, univerſally, and irreverſibly decreed, that they ſhall all uſe them accordingly, and that he himſelfe will interpoſe by the power of his ſpirit, that not a Man of them ſhall miſcarry at this point. I have but a word to ſay to this: let them produce ſuch a decree as this, and it ſhall be <hi>an end of all</hi> ſtrief between me and them (as to this point) immediately. But how little there is to evince any ſuch decree, in all that they are wont to alledge and argue to that purpoſe, will ſufficiently appeare upon the examination, whereunto we ſhall bring it in due time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As that Doctrine of perſeverance, whereof Profeſſors make ſuch a<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> treaſure, is deeply acceſſary to the greateſt part of thoſe feares, thoſe wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and gripings of conſcience, wherewith their peace is interrupted, and their comforts appal'd and ſhaken, ſo is it exceedingly to be feared that it hath a potent and pernicious influence of cauſality into thoſe frequent, daily and moſt ſad apoſtaſies and declinings from wayes of holineſſe, unto looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and prophaneſſe, which are found amongſt them. For when the fleſh, or that which is corrupt, carnall, and ſenſuall in a Man (a Principle not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in being, but even vigorous more then enough in the greateſt and beſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers)
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94900:97" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhall be intoxicated with ſuch a luſcious and fulſome conceit as this, that it hath <hi>goods layd up</hi> for the dayes of eternity, hath it not the temptation of that <hi>fooliſh</hi> man (as he is called) upon it, who upon a conceit that he had <hi>goods laid up for many yeares,</hi> incouraged his Soule unto vanity; <hi>Soule, take thine eaſe, Eate, Drink, and be Merry</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 12. 19</note>. When a man that ſtands, is in any capacity of falling, is it not the only way to educe that power or capacity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to act, and to cauſe him to fall indeed, to perſwade him that he is in no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of falling? <hi>Agag</hi> being full of this conceit, <hi>Surely the bitterneſſe of Death is paſt</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 32.</note>, came (as the Text ſaith) unto <hi>Samuel, delicately.</hi> When the fleſh ſhall be taught to ſay, <hi>Surely the bitterneſſe of eternall death is paſt,</hi> I am out of all danger, all poſſibility of <hi>ſuffering the vengeance of eternall fire,</hi> is it not a ſecret and bewitching incouragement unto it <hi>to wax wanton againſt Chriſt,</hi> and to feed foule upon the ſinful delicacies of this preſent World? Not only the <hi>diſtinct ſound,</hi> but any confuſed blaſt of ſuch a <hi>trumpet</hi> as this, is ſufficient to prepare the fleſh <hi>to the battell</hi> of ſence, and ſenſuality. Nor doe they ſeem to be much acquainted with, at leaſt not much to conſider; the genius of that Principle in men we now ſpeak of (I meane, the fleſh) who thinke there is any other meanes ſo proper, or probable to hamper it, to break the heart and ſtrength of it, as the Iron yoke of the feare and dread of the <hi>Worme that never dieth.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="1">1. Be it ſuppoſed (which yet will never be proved) that all they who fall away from a Profeſſion of Faith and Holineſſe, without riſing againe, or returning, were never true Believers, yet it cannot be denied (and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly granted by men of contrary judgement) but that many of them were, or might be, in a very faire, probable, and hopefull way of obtaining true Faith, of being made ſound Believers. Now that Doctrine, whoſe native and proper tendency is to take men off from the meanes, or to turne them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide out of the wayes of Life and Peace, or (which is the ſame) of ſound Believing, is every whit as much, (if not more) Anti-evangelicall, as that which directly occaſioneth ſuch miſcariages in thoſe, who do truly believe.

Becauſe though the teſtimony of a mans Heart and Conſcience touching his uprightneſſe towards God, or the ſoundneſſe of any thing that is ſaving in Him, be comfortable and cheering, yet ſeldom are theſe Properties, (this comfortableneſſe and cheeringneſſe of it) built upon ſuch foundations, which are ſufficient to warrant them, at leaſt upon ſuch, whoſe ſufficiency in this kinde men duly apprehend.

The credit and authority of that teſtimony, which any Mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence gives in unto him touching the truth and ſoundneſſe of his Faith, muſt needs in a very great meaſure depend upon the equable flowings or iſsuings forth hereof in wayes and workes of Righteouſneſs, becauſe when there is any conſiderable interruption in theſe, that teſtimony will be ſuſpended and put to ſilence for the time, unleſs the Conſcience it ſelf be under the power of ſome deluſion.

            <p n="2">2. Though Doctrines and other means of ſpirituall comfort, are very<note place="margin">§. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> deſireable, and earneſtly to be purſued and contended for, when they are regular, and lawfull; yet as we muſt be content to be at the allowance of our Heavenly Father, for the accommodations and comforts of this preſent Life, and not be our own Carvers of all that comes within our reach, for ſuch a purpoſe, ſo ought we no leſs to reſt ſatisfied with ſuch grounds and meanes for our ſpirituall conſolation, which God hath judged meete for us, and hath Himſelf adminiſtred unto us in His Word, and not ſtraine our phantaſies or apprehenſions to mould ſuch Notions and Doctrines, as we our ſelves conceit to be commodious and ſerviceable to us in ſuch a way. And as it is an high reproach unto the gracious and bountifull Providence of God for Men to have recourſe unto the Devill, or any of his uncleane Arts or Methods, for their temporall ſupplies in any kinde; ſo is it no leſs (if not rather much more) diſhonorable to Him, when Men ſhall make themſelves beholding to a ſpirit of error for the ſupports or ſupplies of their inner Man.

            <p>That it is no wayes comforting or ſtrengthening to the ſpirit, or ſpirituall<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> and regenerate part of a Man, but rather fulſome and importune, is evident from hence, becauſe a man, ſo far as he is regenerate and ſpirituall, deſires not, wiſheth not Heaven, or Salvation it ſelf, but only in wayes of Holineſſe and of Honor: nor would he purchaſe a diſpenſation, though it were offered unto him, with the leaſt haire on his head, to take his fill in the pleaſures of ſin, without danger. Nay if an Angell from Heaven ſhould come and offer ſuch a diſpenſation as this unto him upon the terms ſpecified, it would be as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane and accurſed offer unto him. The Holy Angels, becauſe they have no fleſh, no corruption in them, though they be mutable, (as all Creatures whatſoever by the unavoideable Law of their Creation, are) value not their happineſſe, or their ſecurity in their ſtandings, at the leaſt mite the leſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no liberty of ſinning without danger: nor would they account ſuch a liberty any priviledge or comfort at all to them, if they had it. But that they are capable or in a poſſibility of ſinning, as well as Men regenerate, though not in ſo neer a capacity, we ſhall (I conceive) have opportunity to demonſtrate in the ſequell of the Diſcourſe. Now a Man regenerate, take him ſo far as he is ſpirituall, and borne of God, valueth opportunities of ſinning no more than an Angell: nor deſireth continuance in the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, upon any other terms or conditions, then ſuch, on which the Lord Chriſt Himſelf (as it ſeemes) injoyed it. <hi>If yee keepe my Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, yee ſhall abide in my Love: even as I have kept my Fathers Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and abide in his Love</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 10</note>. So then evident it is that the <hi>new Man</hi> taketh no pleaſure, rejoyceth not in any ſuch Doctrine, which inſures either perſeverance in Faith, or continuance in the Favour and Love of God, to it, upon any other terms, then <hi>of walking holily and humbly with him.</hi> And upon theſe terms the Doctrine which teacheth a Poſſibility of the <hi>Saints</hi> declining, inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both the ſaid glorious accommodations, with as high an hand of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as it.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Should it be granted, that a full and Perfect aſsurance of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Love of God upon all, upon any, terms whatſoever, even of the greateſt ſin and wickedneſs, would be an effectuall motive upon the Heart and Conſcience of a regeneate Man, to cleave in Love unto God, yet would it not be a motive in this kinde of any ſuch ſtrength or efficacy, as ſuch an aſsurance as this, that he ſhall continue in the Love and Favour of God for ever, in a way of Righteouſneſs and well doing, but with all ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of looſing this love, in caſe he ſhall decline unto wickedneſs. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why this latter compounded motive, muſt needs be of more efficacy to the purpoſe mentioned, then the former, is, becauſe the latter ſuppoſeth a neceſſity of this cleaving in Love to God for the obtaining of this great good [<hi>the continuance for ever of the Love of God towards him.</hi>] which the former doth not. Now this is a generall rule, that that motive is ſtill of greater force to perſwade to an action, which renders the action perſwaded unto, as of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity for the obtaining of ſome deſirable end; eſpecially when the ſaid end is inſured withall, upon the performance of the action, then that which renders this end attaineable without the Performance of this action. He that ſhall perſwade me to love ſuch or ſuch a man, by telling me, that whether I love him, or no, yet he will deale lovingly and friendly by me, ſhould not perſwade me to love him by an argument or motive of ſo much ſtrength, as he that ſhould move me to the ſame Point, thus: if you love him, he will deale very lovely and friendly with you; but if you ſhall neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or voluntarily injure him, you will finde him a ſore enemy. There is no action how lovely or deſirable ſoever in it ſelf, but becomes ſo much the more deſirable, by how much the greater good ſhall appear to depend upon it, and muſt needs be produced by it; eſpecially if it ſhall yet further appear, that this good cannot be produced or obtained by any other meanes whatſoever, without it. Now then as he who deprives a man of a greater benefit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs him in a leſſer, doth him as real an injury or wrong, as he that ſhould take away a part of his ſubſtance from him without any conſideration at all: in like manner that Doctrine, which ſhall bereave the ſpirituall part of a man, or a Believer, of a greater and more effectuall motive to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a duty, only to preſent him with a weaker, and of leſs Power, muſt in reaſon be judged an enemy unto the one and the other, yea as great an
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94900:101"/> enemy, as ſuch a Doctrine would be, which deny them a leſser motive in that kinde, without any recompence at all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If ſuch a knowledge or aſſurance, as the Objection ſpeakes of, were<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> an effectuall motive to perſwade the heart of a man to cleave in love unto God, what reaſon can be given why God ſhould not adminiſter it, in order to ſuch a Purpoſe, as well to his enemies and carnall men, as unto his Saints or Friends? For, 1. certaine it is, that all men whatſoever are commanded by God to love Him, or to cleave in this affection unto Him. 2. As cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that God is not defective in the ſubminiſtration of motives unto them on this behalf, no not of thoſe that are moſt Proper and efficacious to perſwade them thereunto. 3. As certaine it is, as either of the former, that an aſſurance of the love of God towards them againſt all ſin and wickedneſſe whatſoever that they are capable of committing, is a motive every whit as taking with, as ſuteable and pleaſing to Naturall and Carnall Men, (if yet a motive it be) as to ſpirituall and holy Men, to perſwade them to the love of God. Therefore if God hath not thought meet to afford ſuch a motive as this is, unto Naturall or Carnall Men, it is no wayes likely that he hath afforded it unto Saints; with whoſe hearts, as ſuch, (I meane, as they are Saints) it hath no agreement or takingneſſe at all (as was ſhewed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) <note n="a" place="margin">Sect. 16, 17. of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, the very truth is (all things duly conſidered) that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> we now ſpeake of, and which is ſpecified in the Objection, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all in it of the true Nature or Property of a motive, to perſwade any Man to cleave in love unto God. For whatſoever repreſenteth God to the Heart, Soule, or Conſcience of a Man, as a God, in whoſe <hi>ſight he is good,</hi> that <hi>doth evill</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mal. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17</note>, and conſequently as no <hi>God of judgement;</hi> as a God Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing His Love, Favour and Acceptance, as well unto <hi>Dogs returning unto their vomits, and to Swine wallowing,</hi> after their <hi>waſhing, in the mire,</hi> as well as unto Lambs and Sheep, is no conſideration which commendeth him unto his Creature, Man, or conſequently which hath any thing in it, to ingage him to cleave in love to him. Suppoſe a man were thus Principled, that having once had a good opinion of any man, he would never alter his opinion of him, how deſperately ſoever the Man ſhould degenerate from himſelf, as though he ſhould become the firſt borne amongſt all the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> turne the moſt bloody murtherer, the moſt cruell oppreſsor, the moſt brutiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuary under Heaven; but under the guilt and daily Practiſe of theſe and ſuch like abominations, ſhould love this Man with as much truth, reality, and ſincereneſs of affection, only upon the account of his ſometime<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as he doth the moſt vertuous and worthy Perſon under Heaven, would ſuch a Temper or Principle as this, commend him as a Perſon ſo much the more worthy love and reſpects, in the eyes of any conſidering Man? or would they not rather draw diſparagement and contempt upon him, yea and this from thoſe very Perſons, whom he ſhall affect and love upon ſuch terms? Therefore in caſe it were poſſible for me certainly to know, that how looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how Prophanely, how debauchedly ſoever I ſhould behave my ſelf, yet God will love me as intirely, as fervently, as he doth the holieſt and moſt righteous man under Heaven, it would be a very ſlender motive unto me to cleave i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> love unto him. So then it doth not yet appear by any thing that hath been mentioned or argued to the Point, that the Doctrine of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, as it paſseth up and down amongſt us, is any contributor to the Peace or Comfort of that, which is of God, but only to that which is of <hi>Satan,</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:94900:101"/> in men, and which deſerveth mortification and Crucifying inſtead of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Peace.</p>
            <p>If it be yet further Objected; But is not the Doctrine of falling away a<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> very uncomfortable Doctrine, apt to beget a ſervile ſpirit in the Saints, a a ſpirit of bondage and feare? Or muſt not they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who apprehend themſelves to be in continuall danger of falling away, and Periſhing, needs eate their bread in darkneſs, dwell with Sorrowes and Perplexities of ſoule all their dayes? To theſe, and all other reaſonings and demands of like import with them, I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To be in danger of falling away, and to be under a Poſſibility of falling away, are two very different things; at leaſt if we take the word, danger, in the common (which yet is the Proper,) Notion and ſignification of it, <hi>viz.</hi> as it imports a Probability or likelyhood of evill to befall thoſe, that are ſaid to be in danger. A man that is in danger (Properly ſo called) of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering evill, if the evill be great, cannot well injoy himſelf with much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or Peace, whileſt the danger continues. But he that is only in a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſuffering evill, eſpecially being ſufficiently Provided of meanes whereby to prevent the comming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the evill upon him, if he pleaſe, is fully capable of injoying himſelf upon the richeſt and beſt terms of ſecurity, that are competiable to a Creature. Nor are men wont to be troubled with the lighteſt grudgings of feare in reſpect of ſuch an evill, though very grievous in the Kinde and Nature of it, which may very poſſibly befall them, in caſe they may with ordinary care keep themſelves from it. Men may very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly fall into the fire, and be burnt: into the water, and be drowned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the tops of Houſes, or Steeples, and be daſh'd in peeces: yet no man lives ever a whit the more uncomfortably, or under any kinde of feare, becauſe they live under a Poſſibility of ſuffering theſe great evills. The reaſon of their ſecurity in this kinde, is, becauſe they know that God hath given them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and underſtanding ſufficient to preſerve themſelves from them. In like manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God having vouchſafed unto the Saints meanes abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to preſerve themſelves from Apoſtaſie, and conſequently from Periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that they need not, either Apoſtatize, or Periſh, except themſelves pleaſe, there is no occaſion at all (much leſſe any neceſſity) why they ſhould live any whit the more uncomfortably, or abate ſo much as the leaſt haire of their Head in confidence of being ſaved, only becauſe they are under a Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Declining, and ſo of Periſhing. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf to have been under a Poſſibility of being made a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> or <hi>cast-away (lest,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>having Preached unto others, I my ſelf ſhould prove,</hi> or become, <hi>a cast-away</hi>

               </note>) yet at what an excellent rate and height of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, yea of <hi>joy unſpeakeable and glorious,</hi> did he live? <hi>I am perſwaded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angells, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor Height, nor Depth, nor any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 38, 39.</note>. That which miniſtred unto him the ground-worke of this moſt raiſed, and bleſſed confidence, notwithſtanding the Poſſibility he was under of being made a <hi>cast-away,</hi> was partly that cleare and certaine knowledge which he had of the unchangeable Purpoſe of God to give Salvation unto all thoſe, who ſhould Perſevere in Faith and Holineſſe unto the end; par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly alſo the like knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the bounty of God towards all His Saints, in vouchſafing unto them ſo rich and full a Proportion of meanes, as he doth, whereby to Perſevere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accordingly. Thus then we ſee, that the Doctrine
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94900:102"/> of falling away, teaching only a Poſſibility hereof, and ſo of Periſhing, is no Doctrine of uncomfortableneſs, nor neceſſarily occaſioneth the leaſt fear in men of falling away, or of Periſhing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe (for Argument ſake) the Doctrine of Perſeverance ſhould<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> be ſubſcribed unto, and that abſolute aſſurance of Salvation granted unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, which this Doctrine pretends to give unto them; yet will not that conditionall aſſurance, which the other Doſtrine affords unto them, fall much ſhort of it (yea in moſt reſpects, ſome whereof have been already touched, it will be found, in order to their Comfort and Peace, greater then it.) Put caſe I were a man, who very much deſired to live long in the World, and God ſhould pleaſe to grant me a Leaſe or Aſſurance of my life for a thouſand years, only upon condition that I ſhould not willfully deſtroy myſelf, as either by thruſting a Sword through my own bowels, or by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf headlong from ſome high Tower, or by taking Poyſon known to me for ſuch before hand, with the like; would I not upon the matter be as well ſatisfied with ſuch a conditionall Leaſe or Grant as this, as with one that ſhould be abſolute, and wherein my life ſhould be aſſured unto me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all poſſible attempts to be made by my ſelf to deſtroy it? Doubtleſs if it were ſimply long life, which I deſired, the former grant would be as ſatisfactory unto me, as the latter. Indeed if beſides the ſecurity of my life, and of the continuance of it for ſuch a terme, I ſhould wantonly or vaine gloriouſly deſire to ſhew deſperate tricks, without fear or danger, as to take Lyons by the beards, or Beares by the pawes, to treade upon Cockatrices, to waſh in cauldrons of boyling Lead, or the like, then the latter grant would accommodate me better then the former. In like manner, if it be ſimply and ſingly the Salvation of my ſoule, which I deſire, and the certainty or aſſurance hereof, ſuch a conditionall Promiſe made unto me by God as this, that ſaved I ſhall certainly be, if I will but quit my ſelf like a Man, abſtaine from <hi>fooliſh luſts,</hi> and not, with the <hi>Dog, returne againe to my vomit,</hi> or with <hi>the Swine</hi> that hath been <hi>waſhed, to my wallowing in the mire,</hi> ſuch a Promiſe (I ſay) as this is ſecurity in abundance unto me in that behalf. But if my deſire be, over and above the ſaving of my ſoule, to live looſely and prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to diſport my ſelf in all manner of ſin and wickedneſs, to affront the Heavens, and bid defiance to the Almighty, and laugh Jeſus Chriſt and His Goſpell in the face to ſcorne, or the like, without running the hazard of loſing my ſoule, then I confeſſe only ſuch a Grant or Promiſe of Salvation from God, as the Doctrine of abſolute Perſeverance demands, would ſatisfie and content me, and furniſh me with that aſſurance which I deſire. So that the moſt expreſs and evident truth is, that there is nothing more in that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Salvation, which the Doctrine of abſolute Perſeverance pretends unto, then in that, which the Doctrine of falling away, or of conditionall Perſeverance, indulgeth unto the Saints, but only a liberty or fearleſſeneſs of ſinning, And whether men may not be of a free, ingenuous, and Son-like ſpirit, without a liberty, or boldneſs of ſinning; yea whether ſuch a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as this, will conſiſt with that ſpirit, I freely refer to the Determination of any man, who hath been never ſo little baptiſed into the ſpirit, whereby the Saints cry, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That Doctrine which is efficacious and proper to cut off, and prevent<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> all thoſe occaſions and miſcarriages, from which troubles of Conſcience, doubtings of Salvation, fears of Periſhing, &amp;c. do moſt frequently (if not alwayes) ariſe, muſt needs be a Doctrine of a far better comportance with
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94900:102"/> the Peace and Comfort of men; than that, which is apt to multiply, or to give being to ſuch occaſions. Now, 1. that the uncleane iſſues of luſt and corruption in the lives and wayes of Men, are the Springs and Fountaines that commonly ſend forth the bittter waters of inward troubles, fears, and perplexities of ſoule, hath been already argued in this Chapter; and beſides, is nothing, but what the daily experience of too many fealeth unto for truth, 2. It hath been likewiſe brought forth into a cleer light, that the Doctrine of abſolute Peſeverance is of as pregnant and dangerous a calculation, as a Doctrine lightly can be, to cauſe the lives and wayes of men to abound with thoſe uncleane iſsues we ſpeak of. Therefore, 3. (and laſtly) I here add; that the contrary Doctrine, (I meane, of conditionall Perſeverance) is of a kindly temper, of a moſt abſolute, choyce, and proper conſtitution, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the breakings out of ſuch iſsues, to amate the courage, and to break the heart of thoſe corruptions in men, which otherwiſe would be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, and hardly beare reſtraint: and conſequently, is a faithfull and ſevere guardian to and over the Peace and Comforts of Men. For teaching on the one hand, certainty of Perſeverance, and of Salvation thereupon, upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious uſe of thoſe meanes, which God hath preſcribed in order thereunto, (I mean, for the inabling of men to perſevere) it mightily cheereth, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and ſtrengtheneth the ſpirit in men, who deſireth (as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) neither Perſeverance, nor Salvation it ſelfe, upon any other terms, then theſe, and rejoyceth above meaſure, that upon theſe, they may, and ſhall, moſt aſſuredly be had; and on the other hand, by teaching, that by looſeneſſe, prophaneſſe, negligence in the uſe of meanes, &amp;c. there may be an apoſtatizing to Perdition, it ſorely rebukes the fleſh, or corruption in a Man, and puts a ſharp bit and bridle into their lips. <hi>A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bridle</hi> (ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon) for the Aſſe, and a rod for the Fooles back</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pov. 26. 3</note>. The terrible <hi>rod</hi> of Hell fire, is <hi>for the back</hi> of that great <hi>Foole,</hi> the fleſh, or that which is irrationall and unruly in Men, without the ſhaking and ſound whereof it will hardly learn ſubjection.</p>
            <p>If it be objected; yea but experience ſhews, that the contrary Doctrine,<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> that which maintaines un-conditioned Perſeverance, is more effectuall to ſubdue corruption in men, then the other, in as much as many, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Doctrine of falling away, are known to be looſe, and of ſinfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in ſeverall kinds, to be no friends to the power of Religion, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as men of greateſt holineſſe, and ſtricteſt converſation, are known to be of the contrary judgement; to this alſo I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The experience aſſerted in the Objection, is not ſo unqueſtionable in Point of truth, but that if the Aſſertors were put home upon the Proof, they would (I fear) account more in preſumption, then in reaſonableneſs of Argument. For if perſons of the one judgement, and of the other, were duly compared together, I verily believe there would be found every whit as full a proportion of men truly Conſcientious and Religious amongſt thoſe, whoſe judgements ſtand, and have ſtood, for a poſſibility of falling away in the Saints, as on the other ſide. But through a fooliſh and unſavoury kinde of partiality, we are apt on all hands, (according to the Proverb) to count all our own Geeſe, for Swans, and other mens Swans, Geeſe. Certaine I am, that if the Writings of men of the one judgement, and of the other, be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, and an eſtimate made from hence of the Religious worth and holineſſe of the Authors reſpectively, thoſe who oppoſe the common Doctrine of Perſeverance, need <hi>count it no robbery</hi> to make themſelves every
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94900:103"/> wayes <hi>equall</hi> in this honour with their oppoſers. The truth is (if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me to utter, what I really apprehend and judge in the caſe) I do not finde the ſpirit of holineſs to breath with that Authority, heate, or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of power in the writings of the latter, which I am very ſenſible of in the writings of the former. Theſe call for Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, and all manner of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> converſation with every whit as high an hand, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and add nothing to check, obſtruct, or enfeeble the authority of their demands in this kinde: whereas the other, though they be <hi>ſore</hi> many times in their exhortations and conjurements unto holineſs, yet otherwhile render both theſe, and themſelves in them, <hi>contemptible,</hi> by avouching ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which cut the very ſinews and ſtrength of ſuch their exhortations, and fully ballance all the weight of thoſe motives, by which they ſeeke to binde them upon the conſciences of men. And for numbers of men truly holy, and conſcientious, doubtleſs the Primitive Chriſtians, for three hundred years together, and upwards, next after the times of the Apoſtles, will fully bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance (with an abundant ſurpluſſage) both for numbers, and truth of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, all thoſe in the reformed Churches, who ſince <hi>Calvins</hi> dayes have adhered to the common Doctrine of Perſeverance. And that the Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> more generally, during the ſaid ſpace of 300 years and more, next after the Apoſtles, held a poſſibility of a totall and finall defection, even in true and ſound Believers, is ſo cleare from the records, yet extant of thoſe times, that men who ſhall pleaſe to acquaint themſelves with them, cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much oppoſition from their Conſciences, deny it. We ſhall (God willing) give ſome light of proofe to this Aſſertion in the 15 Chapter of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the Perſons ſignally (I ſuppoſe) aimed at for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> of the ſaid experiment on the right hand, as <hi>Calvin, Muſculus, P. Martyr, Bucer,</hi> with other Proteſtant Divines of like Note and Name with them; together with ſuch of our Engliſh Miniſters, and other Profeſſors amongſt us, who ſtood up with the greateſt zeal in oppoſing Ceremony and Superſtition, Epiſcopall tyranny, and Popiſh innovations, being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reputed men very exemplary, and particular in their wayes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, my anſwer is, 1. That it is a meere miſtake to conclude or think, that theſe, eſpecially the former, were ſo through or ſetled in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Doctrine of abſolute Perſeverance, as to have no thoughts within them, comming and going, the contrary way. He that ſhall narrowly and unpartially peruſe their Writings, will (I verily believe) finde in them every whit as much ſaid for conditionall, as for abſolute Perſeverance. I ſhall (God willing) give a very competent account of this my Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of this Diſcourſe: and ſhall fully prove by ſeverall expreſſe teſtimonies from ſome of the leading men, and greateſt maſters amongſt them, that they had a very good minde, at leaſt at times, to be of that opinion, which affirmeth a poſſibility of defection in the Saints even to the looſing of the Soule. And for the latter (I meane, the Engliſh Miniſters, and thoſe mentioned with them) there is the like conſideration of theſe alſo. The works of ſuch of them, as have written, bewray them to have had both the Nations we ſpeak of in their womb; in which works or writings of theirs, if they ſpeak one word for a neceſſity of Perſeverance in the Saints, it is ten to one but they ſpeak another for a poſſibility of ſuch a defection, which is never accompanied with Repentance. For thoſe godly Miniſters now upon the Stage, who are looked upon as rigid Patrons and Aſſertors of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94900:103"/> Doctrine of Perſeverance, the truth is, that whatſoever they are in the letter of their Concluſion, they are in the Spirit of their Principles and Premiſes, builders up of that Faith, which deſtroyes the Faith of that Doctrine: moſt of their Sermons, which any wayes relate unto that ſubject, having (<hi>Janus</hi>-like) two Faces, with the one of which they countenance this Doctrine, and with the other, that which is contrary unto it. So that the experience pretended in the objection of ſo many pious men embracing the Doctrine of Perſeverance, is but a meer preſumption: the men generally are divided in their own judgements about the Point. True it is, our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Miniſters and Profeſſors, more generally profeſs themſelves for the Doctrine of Perſeverance, and cry out upon the Doctrine of falling away, as <hi>Arminian:</hi> but as it fell to <hi>Eſaus</hi> lot, through Divine diſpenſation, to be firſt-borne, and ſo to have the precedency of <hi>Iacob</hi> in worldly honours, in reſpect of time, though at laſt his <hi>Mountaine and his Heritage was laid waſt</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mal. 1 3, 4.</note>, for ever; ſo it ſeemed good to the Providence of God, that, of the Doctrinall twins we ſpeak of, ſtriving together in the wombs of the minds and judgements of thoſe men now under conſideration, that of Perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhould firſt lift up its head in the World, and be applauded; making no queſtion withall, but that the time is a comming, yea and is even at the doore, when this Doctrine muſt decreaſe, and the contrary to it, <hi>increaſe,</hi> and be exalted in the judgements, and tongues, &amp; writings of Men. The maine Providentiall occaſion (I conceive) which hath cauſed the Doctrine of Perſeverance to flouriſh hitherto <hi>like a greene bay Tree</hi> in this Land, as it hath done, was the Permiſſion of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his judgement to be over-ruled on this hand, by thoſe Texts of Scripture, (ſome, or all of them) together with thoſe reaſons, which are commonly at this day inſiſted upon for the Proof of this Doctrine. The great worth of the Man otherwiſe, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Opinion unto many far above the worth thereof. And it being ſo incident unto men, <hi>malle credere quam judicare,</hi> rather to believe, then<note place="margin">

Before his dayes, this Doctrine found no ſuch generall applauſe or intertainment amongſt conſcientious Perſons in this Land, and many of the learned Martyrs in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes leaned another way; who likewiſe deſſented from him in ſeverall other Tenents about the <hi>Arminian</hi> controverſies. And when I conſider what grudgings there are of the contrary Opinion (I meane of that which avoucheth a Poſſibility of falling away) in the judgements of the moſt conſciencious Miniſters amongſt us, though the ſtreame of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions runs in oppoſition hereunto, &amp; withall what Principles they cleerly and frequently hold forth, eſpecially in the applicatory Parts of their <hi>Sermons;</hi> I am eaſily induced to believe, that as by the authority of one Man, or ſome few, the Profeſſion of ſuch a judgement came in upon them, and ſurpriſed them, ſo likewiſe they want nothing in order to the Profeſſion of a change of their judgements in the Point, but only the authority and countenance of ſome one, or ſome few Men of like Popular acceptance, to goe before them, 2. Suppoſe it ſhould be granted, that the godly Perſons minded in the Objection as holding the Doctrine of Perſeverance, were perfectly whole and intire, and not divided (as hath been ſaid) in their judgements there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,

            <p n="3">3. Concerning the Perſons chiefly intended in the Objection for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> of the experience therein averred, on the left hand, who (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) were the worſt of our late <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Romanized,</hi> and <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized</hi> moſt amongſt them, together with their Clergy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> creatures and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, who were generally inclined to the Doctrine of falling away, and with all took more liberty in their lives, then men truly Religious ought to have done; my Anſwer is, 1. That as was ſaid concerning the godlineſſe of the other, that it did not neceſſarily flow from the Doctrine of Perſeverance, either as held, or profeſſed by them, ſo neither did that looſeneſſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe in any kinde, which was found in theſe, neceſſarily (no, nor ſo much as probably) ariſe from that Opinion concerning the poſſibility of a totall and finall defection in the <hi>Saints,</hi> profeſſed by them. They held other Principles more then enough, ſufficient to teach them all that irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larneſſe and unrighteouſneſſe of converſation, which can with truth be charged on them. So that neither the good, nor the bad, neither the godly, nor the ungodly, deportments of perſons profeſſing ſuch, or ſuch particular Doctrines, principles, or opinions, are any demonſtrative, no nor yet ſo much as any Dialecticall or probable arguments, either of truth, or error in them. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes</hi> were <hi>full of all Hypocriſie</hi> and unrighteouſneſſe, yet did they hold and teach many Doctrines that were ſound, in ſo much that the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf commanded his own Diſciples to <hi>obſerve and doe,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they taught as neceſſary to be <hi>obſerved</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 23. 3.</note>. And if the ſoundneſſe or rotteneſſe of Opinions ſhould be eſtimated by the goodneſſe, or badneſſe of the lives of any parcell, or number of perſons profeſſing them, as well the Opinion of <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> which denies the being of any God, as the Opinion of <hi>Polytheiſme,</hi> which affirmes a plurality of Gods, muſt be eſteemed better and more ſound, then that which maintaineth the being of one God, and of one only. For certaine it is, that there have been many Heathens, profeſſors, ſome of the one, and ſome of the other of thoſe Opinions, who have quitted themſelves upon far better terms of honour and approbation in their lives, then many <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> profeſſors of the laſt <hi>Opinion,</hi> have done. It is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a great learned man of this Nation, <hi>Atheiſme did never perturb</hi>

There is (I ſuppoſe) a plaine reaſon to be given, why that Generation of men now under diſcourſe, (the popiſh gang of Biſhops, with the Clergy adoring them for perferment-ſake) ſhould, in order to the promoting of their ſecular intereſt, take up the Doctrine, which oppoſeth the common received Doctrine of perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; together with thoſe other Doctrines, commonly, but I know not how properly, or deſervedly, called, <hi>Arminian.</hi> It is ſufficiently known, that the men we ſpeak of, were profeſsed enemies to the moſt Religiouſly-zealous party of the Miniſters in the Land, with their adherents, then commonly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94900:104"/> 
               <hi>Puritans,</hi> whom they both hated and feared, as a generation of men, by whom, rather than any other, they apprehended themſelves in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being dethron'd. <hi>Nec eos fefellit opinio.</hi> Upon this account they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it a very materiall point of their intereſt, to ſuppreſſe and keep under this faction (as they termed them) in order hereunto, they ſtudied and caſt about, how to weaken their intereſt and repute with the generality of the People, or at leaſt with all thoſe that were intelligent, and in that reſpect, conſiderable. To this end, wiſely conſidering that nothing was like to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice them more in their eſteeme with ſuch men, than to detect them of error and unſoundneſſe in their Doctrine; and perceiving withall (as with half an eye they might, being ſo fully diſengaged, as they were, from all high thoughts of thoſe who held them) that they were not in any Doctines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, which they were generally known to hold and teach, more obnoxious to ſuch a detection, then in thoſe, which they held and taught in oppoſition to the Remonſtrants; hereupon they politiquely fell to profeſſe and teach Remonſtrantiſme, that ſo they might have the more frequent occaſion and opportunity, to lay open the nakedneſſe of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Doctrine before the People, and to ſhew the inconſiſtency of it with the Scriptures, as alſo with many the moſt manifeſt Principles, as well of Reaſon, as Religion, beſides. Therefore ſhould it be granted, that (in the generall) there is much in the unworthineſſe of men, who profeſſe ſuch or ſuch a Doctrine, or Opinion, to render the one or the other ſuſpected, yet in the particular caſe before us, there is nothing at all: becauſe the perſons we ſpeak of did not imbrace or take up the Opinion or Doctrine mentioned, out of any naturall compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they reſented in it with their luſts, or any their undue practiſes (for ſuch it had none) but out of a politique only: and as <hi>Austine</hi> ſometimes ſaid, it is no diſparagement to the Sheep, that the Wolf ſometimes puts on and weares her cloathing.</p>
            <p>3. (And laſtly) it is generally known, that the Cathedrall Generation of Men throughout <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> were generally great admirers of the old learning (as ſome call it) I meane, the Writings, and Tenents of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of <hi>Austine</hi> more eſpecially: and that they frequently made ſhield and buckler of their authority, to defend themſelves againſt the Pens and Opinions of later Writers, whom their manner was, according to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of their intereſt (at leſt, as they conceived) to ſlight and vilifie, in compariſon of the other. Now the judgements of the Fathers more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and of <hi>Auſtine</hi> more particularly (as we ſhall ſhew in the procedure of our preſent Diſcourſe) ſtood for the poſſibility of the <hi>Saints</hi> defection, both totall, and finall; wherein (it ſeems) the greater part of our modern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Divines have departed from them.</p>
            <p>Whereas ſome to prejudice the minds and affections of men againſt the<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> Doctrine of a poſſible defection in the <hi>Saints,</hi> (with the reſt commonly found in the ſame retinue) caſt out ſuch ſayings as theſe, that they never knew any, who fell in with theſe <hi>Opinions,</hi> but they declin'd in Religion, and in the end came to nothing, they do but ſpread a ſnare in the way of the ſimple: any conſidering man will laugh ſuch pretences to ſcorne. Such an allegation as this much ſembleth the ſuperſtitious adviſe of thoſe, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Marriages of <hi>Cozen Germans</hi> upon the account of this Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs, that ſuch have never proſpered. It is very poſſible that they may have obſerved and known ſome miſcariage, diſaſter, or leſſe-deſirable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in one or two of theſe conjunctions, amongſt ſome of their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94900:105"/> and friends: but what is there in this to create prejudice in the leaſt in the judgement of any well ballaſſed and conſidering Man, againſt the whole ſpecies of ſuch Marriages, more then there is in the frequent miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages that are found in all kinds of Marriages whatſoever, to diſaffect the minds of Men againſt all theſe alſo? If a man ſhould inquire a little after matters of this Nature in the World, he ſhall ſoone finde or heare of many inſtances, of poore perſons Marrying, who proſpered not, of rich perſons Marrying, who proſpered as little; of Nobles Marrying, whoſe married condition was little bleſt from Heaven; of Princes Marrying, to the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eat affliction, or ruine of themſelves, &amp;c. Is it now reaſonable to infer from ſuch obſervations, or inſtances as theſe, that therefore neither poore Men, nor ric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Men, nor <hi>Nobles,</hi> nor <hi>Princes,</hi> ſhall doe well, or wiſely, to marry? The alledgement in the Objection in hand, is of no whit a better <hi>genius,</hi> then ſuch a collection as this. For what though many, who have clozed in their judgements, (or rather made profeſſion of ſuch a clozure) with the <hi>Opinions</hi> there mentioned, have loſt their ſavour, withered in their zeal, and put away a good Conſcience from them; ought, or can, this in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of reaſonable Men, reflect any whit more prejudice upon the ſaid Doctrines, then the frequent and daily apoſtaſies and declinings, that are made under, and from, the contrary, yea under, and from the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> it ſelf; yea (that which is yet ſomewhat more) under, and from <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf, ought in reaſon to diſparage all theſe? We have a common proverb, that <hi>one Swallow makes not a Summer:</hi> and to ſay, that one Woodcock makes not a Winter, would in time make a proverb of as much Truth.</p>
            <p>But though enough hath been ſaid to evince and maintaine the innocency<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> of the Doctrine under <hi>Protection,</hi> in reſpect of any violation of, or intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon, the inward peace and comfort of the <hi>Saints,</hi> yea and more (I am certaine) then can with good Reaſon be gainſaid, yet prejudice (I know) is reſtleſſe, and thoughts of any long ſtanding in the minds of Men, hardly removed. Therefore it is like, notwithſtanding all that hath been argued hetherto, ſome will ſtill object and ſay, we cannot yet be ſatisfied, but that your Doctrine of falling away muſt needs be very uncomfortable, and of ſad importance to the <hi>Saints:</hi> becauſe though there be but a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity only of their falling away, yet conſidering their manifold and great weakneſſes, and aptneſſe to ſin, they muſt needs be in continuall feares, leſt this poſſibility ſhould be reduced into Act. And therefore there is nothing that can bleſſe them with any ſecurity or peace in this kinde, but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and belief of ſome ſuch fixed and unchangeable Decree of God as this, that however, they ſhall never fall away, to perdition. Nor is there the ſame conſideration of a <hi>Saints</hi> refraining from ſin, and of a Mans forbearing to deſtroy his Naturall Life, by wilfull precipitation, poyſoning himſelf, or the like: becauſe the inclination which is in Men to preſerve their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lives and beings, and ſo to refraine all things manifeſtly deſtructive to them, is Potent, Vigorous, and Active; whereas the inclination to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from ſin, which is in the <hi>Saints,</hi> is comparatively weak, much incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and broken by the fleſh, the frequent Motions and Temptations thereof, &amp;c. To theſe things, and whatſoever may be further pretended in the ſame kinde, I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though that diſpoſition which is in the <hi>Saints</hi> to forbeare ſin, be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> ſo free, nor ſo full of Energy and Power, as the Naturall inclination
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94900:105"/> in Men to preſerve their Naturall Beings; yet, 1. Even this inclination it ſelf is not ſo intire, or free, or ſo ſtrong, but that it is liable to temptation alſo, and ſubject to be incountered, yea and ſometimes is overcome; as in thoſe, who under great Pangs and Agonies of diſcontent, lay violent hands upon themſelves. Therefore there is no ſuch great diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the one inclination, and the other, as the Objection ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be it granted, that the Propenſion in the <hi>Saints</hi> to abſtaine from ſin,<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> ſimply, and in the generall, is nothing ſo energeticall or powerfull, as the Naturall deſire in Men to preſerve their Naturall lives; yet poſſibly it may be, yea probably it is, every whit as potent and operative, in Reference to ſome ſins; and particularly to thoſe, which are likely to occaſion or produce finall Apoſtaſie. For though there be in every ſin whatſoever, a Naturall tendency, according to the kinde and degree of it, towards Apoſtaſie, even that which is finall, as there is in every light prick with a Pin in a Mans finger, towards the diſſolution of the Naturall Life; yet as no man is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd in his Peace and Comfort touching the continuance of his health and life, by a drop o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. Whether that inclination or diſpoſition in the <hi>Saints,</hi> which we now<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> ſpeake of, be actually, and in the generality of them according to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conditions, commenſurable in Strength, Power, and every other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable Property, with the inclination in Men to preſerve their Naturall Beings by the forbearance of all acts whatſoever apparantly deſtructive to them, or no; moſt certaine it is, that God hath vouchſafed unto them a ſufficiency of means, yea means in abundance, to make them every wayes commenſurable hereunto, yea to raiſe them to an higher Pitch or Degree of Strength and Power, then ſo: yea and further hath made them (the <hi>Saints</hi> themſelves I meane) every wayes capable, (all their infirmities and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes conſidered, and allowed for) of the uſe of theſe means even to the actuall producing of ſuch a glorious and bleſſed effect, as that. So that if the ſaid inclination in them be not every wayes as ſerviceable unto them, in ſecuring them againſt all feares of acting in any way apparantly deſtructive to their great ſpirituall intereſt, the ſaving of their Soules, as the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in Men is unto them, to ſecure them from fears of doing any thing knowingly, to the unavoideable loſſe of their lives, the fault is meerly and abſolutely in themſelves; and this not through any infirmity or weakneſſe, which is Naturall to them, and ſo inſeparable, but through a Groſſe, Rank, and Stupid careleſſeneſſe and ſloath. If thus, then is not the Doctrine of falling away any wayes prejudiciall to the Peace and Comfort of the <hi>Saints,</hi> in reſpect of it ſelf, but meerly accidentally and occaſionally, <hi>viz.</hi> as the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94900:106"/> 
               <hi>Saints</hi> will voluntarily, and without any neceſſity either from within, or from without, compeling them, break out into ſuch extravagancies of ſin, which, that Doctrine being true, may juſtly fill them with fears of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away, and periſhing. But let me ſay this too (which here is not to be omitted) that even the Aſſertors themſelves of the common Doctrine of Perſeverance, doe affirme and teach, that their Doctrine it ſelf notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the <hi>Saints</hi> under ſuch extravagancies of ſin, as we ſpeak of, can have no Comfort, Peace, or Aſſurance of Salvation, and conſequently no aſſurannce of Perſevering in Faith unto the end. Therefore by their own confeſſions and tenor of diſcourſe, there is no ſuch great difference between the two Doctrines, in Reference to the Peace or Comfort of the <hi>Saints,</hi> the one (I meane that of Perſeverance) leaving them obnoxious unto feares and doubtings, as well as the other, yea if ſentence were given between them according to truth, that of Perſeverance muſt be adjudged, not only to leave the <hi>Saints</hi> under a poſſibility or capacity of diſcomfiture and feare (which indeed the other doth) but under a ſore temptation alſo (as we have formerly proved) of tormenting themſelves with ſuch fears, which the other doth not.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded; But what are the meanes, which God hath given (as<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> I ſay) ſo abundantly unto the <hi>Saints,</hi> to make themſelves as free, as ſtrong in inclination to avoid things apparantly deſtructive to their ſpirituall Peace, and Salvation of their Soules, as Naturally Men are to forbeare all ſuch actions, which are apparantly deſtructive to their Naturall Lives; ſo that they need not be any whit more afraid of loſing their Soules through their own actings, then men are, or need to be, of deſtroying their Naturall Lives, upon the ſame terms? I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is nothing which indangereth the Salvation of the Soule, but ſin: yea there is nothing that cauſeth this danger to any much conſiderable or formidable degree but only ſuch ſins, which are notoriouſly manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Saints,</hi> if not by the light of Nature, yet by the light of Grace, and of the Scriptures; manifeſt I meane, not only, or ſimply, as, or that, they are ſins, but manifeſt alſo according to that Relation, wherein we now ſpeak of them, <hi>i. e.</hi> as, and that, they are ſins threatning (as it were) with a loud voyce deſtruction to the Soule. So that (in the firſt place) God hath vouchſafed unto the <hi>Saints</hi> means fully ſufficient to informe them of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is imminently or apparantly deſtructive to their Soules.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath given them Eyes wherewith, and light whereby, cleerly and<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> evidently to ſee and know, that it is not more Rationall, or Man-like, for Men to refraine all ſuch actions, which they know they cannot performe but to the preſent and unavoideable deſtruction of their Naturall Lives, then it is to forbear all ſinfull acts whatſoever; and eſpecially all ſuch, which are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly deſtructive to their Soules.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hath not only given them the Eyes, and the light we ſpeake of,<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> wherewith, and whereby cleerly to ſee and underſtand the things mentioned, but hath further endued them with a faculty of conſideration, wherewith to reflect upon, and review, to weigh and ponder, as oft as they pleaſe, what they ſee, underſtand, and know in this kinde. Now whatſoever a Man is capable, 1. Of Seeing and Knowing; 2. of Pondering and Conſidering, he is capable of raiſing or working an inclination in Himſelf towards it, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Strength, Vigor, and Power, to any degree of goodneſſe or deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe, which he is able to apprehend therein. For what is an inclination
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94900:106"/> towards any thing, as ſuppoſe towards an act, or courſe and frequency of actions, but a propenſion and leaning (as it were) of the Heart and Soule towards it? And how comes the Heart or Soule of a Man to propend or leane towards any thing, but by apprehending and conſidering ſomewhat, that is ſeemingly at leaſt, if not really alſo, good for him therein? And the greater the good is that is apprehended herein, and the cleerer, the more raiſed and multiplied the apprehenſion is, the greater proportionably, the fuller of Strength, Vigour, and Power, muſt the Propenſion, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart and Soule needs be thereunto. So that if, 1. There be worth and goodneſſe ſufficient in any object whatſoever to beare it: and, 2. If a Man be in a capacity of diſcovering and apprehending this good cleerly; and, 3. Be in a like capacity of reviſing or conſidering this his <hi>viſion,</hi> as oft as he pleaſeth, certainly he is in a capacity and at liberty to work himſelf to what ſtrength or degree of deſire and inclination towards it he pleaſeth. Now evident and certaine it is to every Man, or elſe eaſily may be, 1. That there is more good in abſtaining from things, either eminently dangerous, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly deſtructive to his Soule, then in forbearing things apparantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to his Naturall Being. 2. As evident it is, that every Man is capable of attaining, or comming to the certaine knowledge of, and of cleerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending this exceſſe of good to him in the former, above the latter; 3. Neither is it a thing leſſe evident, then either of the former, that every Man is as capable of Ruminating or Re-apprehending the ſaid exceſſe of good, as much, and as oft, as he pleaſeth, as he is ſimply of apprehending it. All which ſuppoſed as undeniably true, it followes with an high hand, and above all contradiction, that the <hi>Saints</hi> may, and have meanes and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities faire and full for the purpoſe, Plant an inclination or diſpoſition in themſelves, to refrain all manner of ſins apparantly dangerous and deſtructive to the ſafety of their Soules, fuller of Energy, Vigour, Life, Strength, Power, then that Naturall inclination in them, which teacheth them to refrain all actions, which they know muſt needs be accompanied with the deſtruction of their Naturall Beings. Therefore if they be more (yea or ſo much) afraid of deſtroying their Lives voluntarily and knowingly, as by caſting themſelves into the Fire, or the Water, or the like, then they are of falling away through ſin, the Fault or Reaſon hereof, is not at all in that Doctrine, which affirm's, and inform's them, that there is a Poſſibility that they may fall away, but in themſelves, and in their own voluntary negligence: they have meanes and opportunities (as we have Proved) in abundance, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves every whit as ſecure, (yea and more ſecure) touching the latter, as they are, or reaſonably can be, concerning the former. The Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility they live under of deſtroying their Naturall Lives with their own hands, doth not occaſion the leaſt trouble or fear of death in them, in ſuch a way. Nor needs the Poſſibility they lie under of falling away, being grounded only upon a Poſſibility of their own voluntary actings, occaſion the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, uncomfortableneſs, or fear in their ſpirits, that they ſhall fall away. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. (To the maine objection in hand) I anſwer further; concerning the<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> manifold weakneſſes of the <hi>Saints,</hi> their aptneſſe to ſin, &amp;c. theſe indeed are ſufficient and Proper to cauſe them to fear, but nor the fear of falling away from God, or from his Grace, but that fear, which the Scripture is wont to oppoſe to high mindedneſſe. <hi>Be not high minded, but feare,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 11. 20</note> This fear is nothing elſe but an humble reflection upon a Mans own weakeneſſe, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94900:107"/> inſufficiency to ſtand by his own ſtrength, which neceſſarily draweth along with it an humble dependance upon God for ſtrength whereby to ſtand, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an acknowledgement of ſtrength received from him, when, and whileſt, he doth ſtand. This is evident from that of the Apoſtle: <hi>worke out your own Salvation with feare and trembling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [i. e.</hi> with humility, with a ſence and acknowledgement of no ſufficiency, as from your ſelves, for ſo important a work] <hi>for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to doe of His good Pleaſure</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Phili, 2. 12. 13.</note>. <hi>i. e.</hi> you are debtors unto him both for every diſpoſition you finde in your ſelves to act, and likewiſe for every action, wherein you doe act, in order to your Salvation. But of this Paſſage of Scripture more hereafter, God willing. In the meane time certaine it is, that the infirmities and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the <hi>Saints,</hi> through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hich they are apt to ſin, doe not require any ſuch Decree in God, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ncludeth in it an impoſſibility of their falling away, to render them ſecure from, or againſt ſuch falling. For as the lighter croſſes and diſcontents, which men daily meet with in their houſhold affaires, converſings with Men, and dealings in the World, bring them into no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or feare of making away themſelves, or deſtroying their own lives, though there be no abſolute Decree of God to ſecure them in this behalf, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall deſire of ſelf-preſervation which God hath planted in them, eaſily over ruling, by the Power and Strength of it, all motions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards ſelf-deſtroying, which are wont to ariſe from ſuch occaſions: in like manner the ſtrength of that inclination or deſire, which is, or ought to be, and very poſſibly (as hath been Proved) might be in the <hi>Saints,</hi> to ſave their Soules, and conſequently to preſerve themſelves from apoſtaſie, is ſufficient, without any ſuch Decree in God as was mentioned, to ſecure them both from all danger, and from all feare of apoſtatizing to deſtruction, notwithſtanding all weakneſſes or infirmities that they are ſubject unto. The truth is, that the infirmities and weakneſſes of the <hi>Saints,</hi> as ſuch, are ſo far from being any neceſſary or juſt ground of fear unto them that they ſhall fall away; that the ſence and acknowledgement of them are moſt cleer, pregnant and effectuall Antidotes and Preſervatives againſt falling away. For he that is inwardly and truly ſenſible of his own weakneſſe and inability to ſtand, will, eſpecially being a <hi>Saint,</hi> or <hi>Believer,</hi> moſt certainly depend upon him for ſtrength, who is both able, and willing to ſupply and furniſh him, upon ſuch terms.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly,) upon the former accompt, and for a cloſe of this <hi>Chapter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 36.</note> I anſwer; that if the Doctrine of falling away be ſo uncomfortable unto the <hi>Saints,</hi> as the objection pretends, the truth is (as we have in the Premiſſes of this <hi>Chapter</hi> made it to appear) they are not much relieved at this Point by the Received Doctrine of Perſeverance. For this Doctrine (as hath been ſhewed) ſcarce ſuffereth any man to believe, upon any Rationall, competent, or ſufficient grounds, that he is a true <hi>Saint,</hi> or <hi>Believer,</hi> yea and doth little leſſe then tempt him to ſuch things, which are exceeding apt and likely to fill him with feares and queſtionings touching the truth of his Faith. And what great comfort can it then be unto him to hear, or believe, that true <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> cannot fall away, or periſh? whereas the other Doctrine leaveth them a good latitude of competent ground, whereon to judge themſelves true <hi>Saints,</hi> and true <hi>Believers:</hi> nor doth it deprive them of ſufficient ground, on which to ſecure themſelves both againſt the danger, and againſt all feare of the danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Apoſtatizing or falling away, to Perdition. This Doctrine therefore, of the two, is (queſtionleſs) of the more benevolous aſpect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Peace and Comforts of the <hi>Saints.</hi>

But finding by experience that weaker men, through too much fulneſſe, and aboundance in their own ſence in matters of Controverſie, and this chiefly by meanes of ſome Texts of Scripture run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill, and working in their heads, which in ſound of words, and ſurface of Letter, ſeeme to ſtand by them in their Sence and Notion, are under a very great diſadvantage, either for minding, or underſtanding ſuch things, which are ſpoken unto them for their information in the Truth; I thought it beſt, for their relief in this caſe, to invert that Method in the preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; and firſt to endeavour to take from them thoſe <hi>weapons,</hi> whether of Scripture, or argument, <hi>wherein they trust;</hi> and afterwards preſent them with ſuch other Scriptures, and grounds, which are Able, Pregnant, and Proper, to build them up, and eſtabliſh them in the Truth.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not tie our ſelves to any Rule, or Preſcript of Order, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> thoſe Scriptures upon the theatre of our Diſcourſe, which men of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering judgement in the cauſe in hand, are wont to plead in defence thereof, themſelves (as far as I have obſerved) obſerving none; but ſhall produce them one by one as God ſhall pleaſe to bring them to mind, unleſſe (haply) two, or more of them, by reaſon of affinity or likeneſſe in Phraſe, or import, may commodiouſly enough be handled together. Moſt of the places com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſerve in this warfare, I finde ſcituate in the New Teſtament. The firſt that commeth to hand, is that of our Saviour unto <hi>Peter—and upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 16. 18</note>. From hence it is argued, that thoſe that are once built by Faith upon the Rock, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or upon the truth of the Goſpell, are not in danger, or in a poſſibility of being <hi>prevailed</hi> againſt [<hi>viz.</hi> to deſtruction] by all the Powers of darkneſs whatſoever. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this promiſſory aſſertion of <hi>Christ, the Gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> &amp;c. doth not neceſſarily reſpect every individuall and ſingle Perſon, who <hi>de praeſenti</hi> is a Member of his Church, ſo as to ſecure him of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, againſt all poſſible ſins, or wayes of ſinning, whereunto he may, or can be drawn by <hi>Satan;</hi> but may well be underſtood of the <hi>Church</hi> in generall, <hi>i. e.</hi> conſidered as a body of men, ſeparate and diſtinguiſhed from the world. Now the <hi>Church</hi> (in this ſence) may be ſaid to ſtand, and be ſecured againſt all the Power and Attempts of the Devill, though not only ſome, but even all the Particular <hi>Saints,</hi> of which this body conſiſts at preſent, ſhould be <hi>prevailed</hi> againſt by <hi>Satan</hi> to deſtruction. Becauſe the <hi>ratio formalis</hi> or eſſence
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94900:108"/> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in this ſence, doth not conſiſt in the Perſons of thoſe, who do at preſent believe, and ſo are members of it (for then it would follow, that in caſe theſe ſhould die, or when they ſhall die, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould have no <hi>Church</hi> at all upon the Earth, in as much as nothing can be without the eſſence of it) but in the ſucceſſive Generation of thoſe, who in their reſpective times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, whether they be fewer, or whether they be more, whether they be ſuch and ſuch Perſons, or whether others. As ſuppoſe there be not now one drop of that Water in the chanell of the River of <hi>Thames</hi> (as it is like there is not) which was in it ſeven years ſince, yet is it one and the ſame River, which it was then: and ſo put the caſe there be not one Perſon now alive in any of the Companies in <hi>London,</hi> of which they reſpectively conſiſted 40. yeares ſince, yet are they the ſelf ſame Companies, which they were then. So then the ſaying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt His Church,</hi> may ſtand clear and firme, though many particular members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould be overcome. Therefore there is nothing in this Scripture to evince that univerſall Perſeverance of all <hi>Saints</hi> which is commonly taught and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived amongſt us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When our Saviour promiſeth that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> 
               <hi>againſt His Church,</hi> his meaning (queſtionleſſe) is this, that death, or the <hi>Grave</hi> (which may very properly be called <hi>the Gates of Hell,</hi> becauſe they that goe, or are ſent to Hell, enter by them thereinto) or elſe that Hell it ſelf <hi>ſhall not prevaile,</hi> i. e. ſhall not have a full or finall conqueſt over thoſe, that ſhall die, built upon the Rock he ſpeaks of, by Faith, as, by Reaſon of their moſt formidable ſtrength, they are like to have over all other Men. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this interpretation his meaning only is, that thoſe that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue firmly built upon him by Faith, ſhall in time be reſcued and delivered out of the hand of all adverſe Powers, yea from death and the grave themſelves, the moſt formidable of all others.</p>
            <p>This Expoſition fully accords with what <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath upon the place.<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> If (ſaith he, Paraphraſing the words of <hi>Chriſt) they ſhall not prevaile againſt it</hi> [my Church] <hi>much more</hi> ſhall they not prevaile <hi>against me.

               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:94900:109"/>2. Whereas (in the ſaid Propoſition) <hi>Christs building of His Church,</hi> is expounded by, the <hi>conſtant adhering</hi> of this Church <hi>unto him,</hi> that which is the Principall thing in queſtion, is taken for granted: which is very in-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative. For the matter in queſtion is, whether the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in all the members of it once <hi>built upon the Rock,</hi> muſt, or doth, neceſſarily ſo adhere to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) the ſaid expoſition renders a ſence very prepoſterous and importune. For upon this account, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſpeak at no better Rate of of Reaſon, then thus: <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile, i. e.</hi> the Subtilty, Policy, and Machinations of <hi>Satan</hi> ſhall not be able to ſeduce thoſe that are <hi>built upon the Rock, i. e.</hi> that conſtantly adhere unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Which amounts to no more, then if he ſhould have ſaid: the Devill ſhall not be able to make thoſe inconſtant, who ſhall be, and remaine conſtant, or to cauſe thoſe, who ſhall firmly adhere unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not to adhere firmly to him. Which ſtrain of diſcourſe, whether it becomes him, who <hi>ſpake as never man ſpake,</hi> I leave unto ſober men to judg.</p>
            <p>Another Argument urged by ſome, againſt the interpretation given, is<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> this. If by the <hi>prevailing of the Gates of Hell,</hi> be meant nothing elſe, but the eternall condemnation of, or perpetuall prevailing of Death againſt, the <hi>Church,</hi> then <hi>Chriſt</hi> here promiſeth nothing, but only in the behalf of thoſe that are Dead: and conſequently nothing, but what may ſtand, with a totall defection of his <hi>Church</hi> on Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this ſeems to be contrary to his intention in the place, <hi>Ergo.</hi> I anſwer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is no inconvenience to ſuppoſe or grant, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this place, and in the Promiſe here mentioned, doth not inſure the perpetuall continuance, or Reſidence of a <hi>Church</hi> on Earth, no more then he doth in many other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which yet are of very high and bleſſed importance, in their Reſpective kinds. In that great Evangelicall Promiſe, <hi>whoſoever believes, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> there is nothing but what may poſſibly ſtand with an univerſall defection of a <hi>Church</hi> on earth; yet is the Promiſe great and Precious. It were eaſie to inſtance many others of like nature. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. As in the Promiſe laſt mentioned, though there be nothing which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily includes an un-interrupted ſucceſſion of <hi>Believers</hi> in the World, yet is there that, which exceeding much conduceth towards the propagation and raiſing of ſuch a ſucceſſion, as <hi>viz.</hi> a promiſſory propoſall of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reward that is, unto whoſoever ſhall believe, even no leſſe then that of eternall life; ſo may it be ſaid concerning this Promiſe of <hi>Chriſt, And the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it.</hi> Here is enough ſaid, if Men would but conſider and quit themſelves like Men, to repleniſh the Earth with a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Believers</hi> like unto the Waters of a River, which fayle not. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) It is not truly ſaid, that this Promiſe, <hi>And the Gates of Hell ſhall not, &amp;c.</hi> (in the ſence aſſerted) relates only to thoſe that are dead. The truth is, that if we ſpeak properly, neither this, nor any other promiſe whatſoever relates only, if at all, unto the dead, or is made only on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Dead: the Dead (in propriety of Speech) are utterly uncapable of Promiſes, though not of performances of Promiſes. But cleerly this, and all other Promiſes are made to the living, and for their accommodation and comfort, though for the letter and reality of the performance of them, they are not to be partakers hereof, untill they have undergone the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Death. It is juſt matter of <hi>joy unſpeakeable and glorious</hi> to him that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94900:109"/> is yet living, to know and conſider, that though he dieth, yet death ſhall not have any ſuch dominion over him, but what he ſhall ſhake off, and that with a bleſſed advantage and conqueſt, in due time. But this exception againſt the expoſition aſſerted, is but like a moat in the Sun, which darkeneth not at all the Rayes or light thereof, but only gaines, by being here, a diſcovery of it felf to be a thing inconſiderable, and next to nothing.</p>
            <p>Another paſsage of Scripture <hi>compell'd to bear the Croſſe</hi> of the ſame ſervice<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> with the former, is that, <hi>Mat. 24. 24. For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and wonders, in ſo much that (if it were poſsible) they ſhall</hi> (or ſhould) <hi>deceive the very elect.</hi> From hence it is inferr'd, that the <hi>deceiving,</hi> or ſeducement of thoſe who truly believe, is a thing impoſſible. But whether the drawing of ſuch concluſions as this, from ſuch Scriptures, as that, be not a drawing of darkneſs out of light, the conſiderations enſuing will be competent enough to determine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In their Notion, who trie to fetch the <hi>Water</hi> of Perſeverance out of the <hi>Flint</hi> of the Scripture mentioned, the word, <hi>Elect,</hi> doth not ſignifie, <hi>Saints,</hi> or true <hi>Believers,</hi> but ſuch as they ſuppoſe to have been, in a perſonall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, choſen by God from eternity out of the great body of mankinde, with an intent to ſave them againſt all poſſible interveniencies, or oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever. Now that ſuch as theſe, at leaſt before their calling, are as liable to be <hi>deceived,</hi> or ſeduced, as other Men, is their own confeſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to whom (queſtionleſſe) they will not deny the grace of their Election, acknowledgeth himſelf with <hi>Titus,</hi> to have ſometimes been, <hi>fooliſh, diſobedient,</hi> and DECEIVED <note n="a" place="margin">Tit 3. 3.</note>. Yea,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is frequently confeſſed by the ſame party, that ſuch <hi>Elect</hi> as they meane, and we lately deſcribed, may even after they are called and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, by the Juſt and Wiſe ſufferance of God, fall into Hereſie, and this in fundamentall Points, yea and into that fearfull ſin of an abnegation and abjuration of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> If ſo, then certainly there is no impoſſibility of their ſeduction. Yea, the great Patrons of the Doctrine of Perſeverance, which managed the Conference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the <hi>Hague</hi> about theſe Queſtions, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1611. acknowledged, that even <hi>true Believers may fall ſo far, as that the Church, according to the command of Christ, ſhall be compelled to teſtifie</hi> [againſt them] <hi>that they cannot</hi> [beare, or] <hi>tolerate them in their outward communion, and that they ſhall have no part in the Kingdome of Chriſt, except they repent [or be converted</hi>

            <p>If it be here ſaid; yea but the Scripture in hand is to be underſtood<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> of a finall <hi>deceiving,</hi> or of a being <hi>deceived</hi> unto deſtruction: and thus (it is there ſuppoſed, that) the <hi>Elect</hi> cannot poſſibly be <hi>deceived,</hi> I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is to preſume, not to argue, or believe. For there is not the leaſt ground, or ſo much as the ſmalleſt ſand in either the words, or context, where on to build ſuch an interpretation, as this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The abettors of this interpretation, are wont to prove from the words, not only an impoſſibility that the <hi>Saints</hi> ſhould <hi>finally</hi> be deceived, but alſo that they ſhould be <hi>deceived totally, i. e.</hi> ſo as to be at any time wholy deſtitute or bereft of that Faith, which is juſtifying and ſaving.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:94900:110"/>3. (And laſtly) the ſame men ſuppoſe, that if the <hi>Saints</hi> may fall away <hi>totally</hi> at any time, they may fall away <hi>finally</hi> alſo. If it be ſaid, that they cannot fall away <hi>totally;</hi> I anſwer; if ſo, then one of theſe three things muſt needs follow; either, 1. That true, ſaving, and juſtifying Faith may ſtand, not only with Hereſie, and this in fundamentall Articles of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> but even with an expreſſe abnegation and abjuration of <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf with his Religion; or elſe, 2. That their Opinion is falſe, who affirme, that true <hi>Believers</hi> may poſſibly fall, both into ſuch Hereſie, and ſuch abnegation, or, 3. (And laſtly) that they, who do fall both into the one, or the other, are not ſeduced, or <hi>deceived.</hi> This laſt is manifeſtly falſe: the ſecond, is the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſence and confeſſion of our adverſaries themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> that true <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> may fall into ſuch Hereſie and abnegation. For the firſt, if ſaving Faith may ſtand with ſuch Hereſie and abnegation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as is there ſpoken of, how will that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf ſtand, <hi>whoſoever ſhall deny me before men, him will I alſo deny before my Father which is in Heaven</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 10. 32</note>? To reply here and ſay, that it is to be underſtood of a finall <hi>deniall,</hi> will not at all ſalve the ſoare. For there is the ſame conſideration of a <hi>deniall of Chriſt,</hi> as to the ejecting of a Man out of his favour, whether it be <hi>finall,</hi> and in the end of a Mans dayes, or whether it be in the middle of them. Nor hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> any whit more reaſon to be offended with him, that <hi>denieth</hi> him at one time, then with him who denieth him at an other, if there be nothing but meerly time to make the difference. It is true, he that <hi>denieth Chriſt</hi> in the middle of his dayes, and ſo caſteth himſelf out of His favour, may poſſibly recover His favour again by Repentance, and a renewed confeſſion of him before men, which he that denieth Him at the inſtant of death, cannot. But as for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and demerit of the ſin, and conſequently in order to the juſt judgement of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon it, it is the ſame in both caſes. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Further to demonſtrate the nullity of the aforeſaid deduction from the<note place="margin">§. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The light of the Sun at Noon day is not more cleare, then that, <hi>if it be poſsible,</hi> doth not here ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, or imply, an impoſſibility.

            <p>That which is commonly pleaded at ſuch turnings, as this, is very light and impertinent, God (ſay our Antagoniſts) as He wills the end, ſo alſo He willeth, and injoyneth the means for the accompliſhment of the end.

For to this we anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though it be very true, that God who willeth the end, willeth and preſcribeth the meanes alſo [<hi>viz.</hi> when He declares the end not to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe attaineable, then in and by the uſe of ſuch meanes, as He preſcribeth in order hereunto] yet when He hath irreverſibly decreed that the end ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be obtained, or that He will interpoſe by an high and irreſiſtible Hand for the effecting of it, and withall hath declared either the one, or the other, or both of theſe His decrees unto the World, it is now no wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with His Wiſdome to injoyn men the uſe of any meanes for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of this end, eſpecially under the penalty or threatning of a non-obtaining it. Nor can any inſtance be produced from the Scripture, where any means have been directed or injoyned by Him upon ſuch terms. As for that, which ſome alledge from <hi>Acts 27.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94900:111"/> they uſe the meanes, or no] deſtroyeth the energy and force of any ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, wherein the uſe of the means ſhall be recommended unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or they perſwaded thereunto. He that ſhall inſure me, that whether I run, or no, I ſhall be crowned, and ſhall afterward exhort me to run, that I may be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall (doubtleſs) pull down that with his Promiſe, which He ſeeks to build up by His exhortation.</p>
            <p>If it be replied and ſaid; but God aſſureth no man that He ſhall not be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> or ſeduced, but only in, and by the uſe of means, that He may not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; I anſwer; if ſo, then God hath made no peremptory Decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the non-ſeducement of the <hi>Elect,</hi> nor other, then with which the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of them may very poſſibly ſtand. For that which depends upon any deliberate or elective Act of the will of man, cannot be ſaid to be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, peremptorily, or abſolutely Decreed by God: nor is it any other, in the Nature and Condition of it, then what may very poſſibly not be. Now certaine it is, that the uſe of means to prevent ſeduction in the <hi>Elect,</hi> is ſuch an Act, or ſeries of Actions, which depends upon the deliberate Act of their will; at leaſt ſo far, that it can never take place, or be, without a deliberate con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>currency hereof.</p>
            <p>If it be yet further ſaid; Though the uſe of means to prevent ſeduction in<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> the Elect, depends upon the deliberate motions and actings of their wills, thus far, that it cannot take place, or be performed without them; yet may it have ſuch a relation unto, or dependance upon, the abſolute will or decree of God, which ſhall give certainty and infallibility of being unto it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. For God is able ſo to interpoſe by His excellency of Power in all the deliberations of Men, as to carry and fix the iſſues, and determinations of them, which way, and upon what He pleaſeth; To this I anſwer; that the Queſtion is not, what God is able by the excellency of His Power to doe in this kinde, but what He is pleaſed to doe, or what He hath decreed to doe out of the Counſell and Liberty of His Will. And that which we affirme and plead in the cauſe depending, is not, that God is not able to determine the wills of the <hi>Elect</hi> to the uſe of means proper and ſufficient to prevent their being <hi>deceived,</hi> but that He hath no where declared Himſelf willing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit <hi>above what is written,</hi> to think that He doth it. Therefore untill it be proved, either from the Scriptures, or by the light of ſome ſolid demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion otherwiſe, that God hath abſolutely Decreed the non-ſeduction of the <hi>Elect</hi> (we ſtill ſpeak of a <hi>ſeduction</hi> to deſtruction) or (which is the ſame, upon our Adverſaries Grant and Plea, lately mentioned) the determination of their wills to the uſe of means neceſſary to ſecure them againſt ſeduction, we judge our ſelves free in Conſcience to deny the pretended impoſſibility of the <hi>Saints deception,</hi> or ſeduction.</p>
            <p>Another Scripture much diſcourſed in the behalf of the common Doctrine<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> of Perſeverance, is, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 5.—who are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation.</hi> From hence it is frequently concluded, that they who once truly believe, and are regenerate, (<hi>Verſe</hi> 3.) are <hi>kept</hi> by the ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Mighty Power of God, from falling away to deſtruction. I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. That it is not here ſaid, that regenerate Men are <hi>kept</hi> ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>by the Power of God unto Salvation,</hi> but that <hi>they are kept by the Power of God</hi> THROVGH FAITH, <hi>unto Salvation.</hi> Which plainly implieth, <hi>that the Power of God</hi> here ſpoken of, ingageth for no Mans preſervation, or ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarding

               <hi>unto Salvation,</hi> but by the mediation of <hi>Faith,</hi> or any whit longer then their <hi>Faith</hi> ſhall continue.

For the cleer ſence and importance of the place, it is this; that Men once <hi>begotten</hi> by God <hi>to a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Christ from the dead,</hi> Have, or may Have, the greateſt ſecurity, which the infinite Power of God can afford, that perſevering in that <hi>Faith,</hi> from whence this <hi>hope</hi> iſſueth, unto the end, they ſhall be <hi>ſaved.</hi> The place, according to this interpretation, runs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel in ſence and import, with theſe, and their fellowes; <hi>But he that ſhall endure to the end, ſhall be ſaved</hi>

            <p>If againſt this Interpretation it ſhall be objected, that it greatly depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> and (in a manner) quencheth the ſpirit of the conſolation, clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Holy Ghoſt to be adminiſtred unto the <hi>Saints</hi> in the words; and that it makes very little for their comfort, to hear of their being <hi>kept unto Salvation</hi> by God, or by His <hi>Power,</hi> in caſe this keeping depends upon their continuance in <hi>Faith,</hi> eſpecially if this alſo be uncertain, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon themſelves, their diligence and care to procure it; I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Heart of this Objection was broken in the former <hi>Chapter</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Sect. 21. 22.</note>, where we ſhewed, that in matters of greateſt conſequence and moſt deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in things appertaining to this life, yea as to life it ſelf, the moſt timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and cautious Men, neither wiſh, nor deſire any greater ſecurity, then to have what they deſire aſſured unto them upon their own willingneſſe and care, either for the procurement, or the continued injoyment, of it. The moſt impotent lover of life under Heaven, and He that lives in the greateſt <hi>bondage</hi> in the World <hi>through feare of Death,</hi> would (both of them) be highly ſatisfied, if God would but vouchſafe ſuch a promiſe as this unto them, that ſo long as they ſhould deſire the continuance of their lives, and take heed of deſtroying them themſelves by unnaturall or deſperate courſes, as by caſting themſelves into the Fire, into the Water, down from high Towers, &amp;c. He would ſecure them againſt all other interveniences, or means of diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever. In like manner, it is, and ought to be ſo eſteemed by the

            <p n="2">2. Though God hath not ſimply and abſolutely undertaken for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance,<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> or continuation of their <hi>Faith</hi> unto the end, nor upon any ſuch terms, but that if they will be brutiſhly and deſperately careleſſe of ſo high a concernment to themſelves as a bleſſed Eternity is, they may make defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from it, and turne Proſelites to Hell; yet hath He laid a rich founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their Perſeverance, in thoſe many precious Promiſes and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which He hath given unto thoſe, who ſhall perſevere, as alſo in thoſe moſt ſevere and dreadfull threatnings, bent againſt the faces of all Apoſtates and backſliders, together with thoſe frequent Promiſes or Declarations, which He hath made, to continue, yea and to inlarge, upon occaſion, the inward contributions of His Spirit, the motions, excitements, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, in order to the plentifull inabling of His <hi>Saints</hi> to perſevere, untill they ſhall willingly and willfully turne their backs upon them, and reject them. Upon the account of all theſe gracious Promiſes and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by God unto His <hi>Saints,</hi> for, or towards, the effectuall accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Perſeverance, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> frequently incourageth them to the hope and expectation of it. <hi>But the Lord is faithfull, who ſhall ſtabliſh you, and keepe you from evill</hi>

               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 8</note>. God, according to the common Dialect and Notion of Scripture language, is ſaid to <hi>eſtabliſh, confirme, and keepe men from evill,</hi> when He doth that, which is of a proper tendency, and ſufficient thereunto, whither the effects or ends themſelves of <hi>establiſhments, confirmation,</hi> &amp;c. be actually obtained, or no, For there is nothing more frequent or familiar in Scripture, then to aſcribe the effects themſelves, ſometimes unto God, ſometimes unto Men, only upon their reſpective actings or doings of ſuch things, which are of a Naturall, Proper, and Direct tendency to produce them, whether they be actually and <hi>de facto</hi> produced, or no. Thus our Saviour chargeth Him, who <hi>ſhall put away his Wife for any other cauſe, then Fornication, with cauſing her to commit Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 5. 32</note>; whether the Woman thus <hi>put away, committeth Fornication,</hi> or no; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe in that act of <hi>putting her away</hi> upon ſuch terms; He doth that, which hath a proper and direct tendency to cauſe Her to commit this ſin. For it is not neceſſary to ſuppoſe that every Woman thus divourced or <hi>put away, committeth,</hi> or will commit <hi>Fornication.</hi> But whether ſhe doth, or no, the ſin of Him that <hi>put Her away,</hi> is one and the ſame: He (in our Saviours Dialect) <hi>cauſed Her to commit Fornication.</hi> Thus alſo, He who <hi>eates</hi> to the offence of a weake Brother, is charged by the Apoſtle with <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying him with his Meate, for whom Chriſt Died</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 14 15 20.</note>. <hi>i. e.</hi> with doing that, which is apt and proper to occaſion His <hi>destruction,</hi> whether He be actually <hi>destroyed,</hi> or no. In this <hi>idiome</hi> likewiſe of ſpeaking, God expreſly ſaith that He had <hi>purged Jeruſalem;</hi> and yet in the ſame place ſaith alſo, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>was not purged. In thy filthineſſe, is lewdneſſe [i. e.</hi> notorious and deſperate obſtinacy] <hi>becauſe</hi> I HAVE PVRGED THEE, AND
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94900:113"/> THOV WAST NOT PVRGED, <hi>thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthineſſe any more, till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ezek. 24 13</note>. God is ſaid to have <hi>purged Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe He vouchſafed proper and ſufficient means unto Her for Her <hi>purging,</hi> as the Miniſtry of His Word and Spirit, frequent Admonitions, Exhortations, Expoſtulations, Promiſes, Threatnings, &amp;c. by His Prophets, however <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by Her rebellious obſtinacy, hindered and obſtructed the through and kindly working of theſe means, by reaſon whereof the deſireable effect of Her <hi>purging</hi> was not obtained. In ſuch a Sence and Phraſe as this, <hi>the goodneſſe of God</hi> is ſaid to <hi>lead</hi> ſuch Men <hi>to Repentance,</hi> who yet are ſo far from Repenting, that <hi>after their hardneſſe, and impenitent heart, they threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up wrath unto themſelves againſt the day of wrath, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 2. 4, 5</note>. meaning, that the <hi>goodneſſe of God</hi> in His Patience and Long-ſufferance towards wicked and ungodly Men, miniſtreth many occaſions and opportunities unto them, by the advantage whereof they might eaſily be drawn to repent, did they not willingly indulge themſelves in that hardneſſe of Heart, which in the fruits of it tends to nothing but to the <hi>treaſuring up of wrath to themſelves, &amp;c.</hi> In the ſame conſtruction, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſtiled <hi>the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſin of the World</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29.</note>; and ſo to be <hi>the propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole World</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 2</note>; not as if, or becauſe, the <hi>ſin of the World</hi> is actually or compleatly <hi>taken away</hi> by Him, or ſo, that this whole <hi>ſin</hi> either is, or at any time muſt needs be, pardoned, or actually <hi>taken away</hi> in all the fruits, conſequents, or effects of it, becauſe He is ſaid to have <hi>taken it away;</hi> but becauſe He hath done and ſuffered that, which hath a glorious efficacy and tendency in it, to, or towards ſuch a <hi>taking of it away;</hi> ſo that if it be not actually and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly <hi>taken away,</hi> the cauſe of it is ſomewhere elſe to be ſought, and found, as <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſinners, or men themſelves, and not in Him. In this ſence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe He is ſaid to be <hi>the propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole World,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the ſinnes of the whole World</hi> are actually, compleatly, or with ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in the event <hi>propitiated</hi> or attoned by Him, but becauſe that Sacrifice of Himſelf, which He hath offered in order to a <hi>propitiating</hi> or attoning <hi>the ſinnes of the whole World,</hi> is ſo pregnant and full of a <hi>propitiatory</hi> efficacy and vertue, and withall is ſo propounded and held forth by God unto <hi>the whole World,</hi> that if any mans <hi>ſin</hi> remaines actually <hi>unpropitiated,</hi> or un-pardoned, it is through his own voluntary neglect of this Sacrifice, and not from any intention on Gods Part, that his <hi>ſin</hi> ſhould not be attoned or <hi>propitiated</hi> by this Sacrifice, as well as any other Mans. It were eaſie to multiply examples of that propriety of expreſſion now under obſervation, from the Scriptures. And I deſire the rather that it may be carefully minded and remembred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I verily believe that the non-advertency of it by Men of learning and worth, with ſome few others of like conſideration (whereof we may give notice in time) hath mainly occaſioned the dividing of their thoughts and judgements from the Doctrine of Univerſall Redemption. We ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited (I ſuppoſe) before the concluſion of this diſcourſe, to recruite the Readers memory with a re-mention of this notion of Scripture Dialect. In the mean time we cleerly ſee by the light of it, how God may be ſaid to <hi>eſtabliſh,</hi> to <hi>confirme unto the end, to keep Men from evill,</hi> though Men neither be actually, or in the event, <hi>eſtabliſhed, confirmed, or kept from evill;</hi> and this without any prejudice, or diſparagement in the leaſt, either unto the grace or goodneſſe of God, or to His Power, or Effectualneſſe of Working, in this behalf.</p>
            <p>The next Scripture, which we ſhall undertake to right, againſt thoſe,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:94900:113"/> who have done it the injury of fathering the common Doctrine of Perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon it, is this. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifeſt that they were not all of us</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 19</note>. From hence this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is drawn up; that they who are of the <hi>Saints, i. e.</hi> of the number of thoſe, who are reall and true <hi>Saints,</hi> will alwayes continue in this number, and never apoſtatize. But for anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. This inference preſumeth many things, for which neither it, nor any the Authors of it, will ever be able to give any good ſecurity of Proof; as <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That this Phraſe, <hi>they were not of us,</hi> imports, that they never were true <hi>Believers.</hi> This certainly can never be proved, becauſe there is another ſence, and this every whit as proper to the words, and more commodious for the Context and ſcope of the Place, which may be given of them, as we ſhall ſee anon. 2. That this expreſſion, <hi>they were of us,</hi> ſignifies, that they were true <hi>Believers;</hi> of the uncertainty of this ſuppoſition, we ſhall give the like account. 3. That theſe words, <hi>they went out from us,</hi> ſignifie their finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion or abdication of the Apoſtles Communion, or their totall and finall renunciation of Chriſt, His <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Goſpell.</hi> This ſuppoſition hath no bottome at all, or colour for it. 4. That this clauſe, <hi>they would no doubt have continued with us,</hi> ſignifieth, they would have continued in the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> wherein we perſevere and continue. Nor is there any competent reaſon to inforce this ſence of theſe words, becauſe neither doth the Grammaticall tenor of them require it, and much leſſe the ſcope of the paſſage (of which in due time.) 5. The ſaid inference ſuppoſeth, that <hi>John</hi> certainly knew, that all thoſe, who for the preſent remained in his Communion, were true <hi>Believers.</hi> For if they were not true <hi>Believers,</hi> they that were <hi>gone out from them,</hi> (in the ſence contended for) might be ſaid to be <hi>of them, i. e.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the ſame condition with them. But how improbable this is (I mean, that <hi>John</hi> ſhould infallibly know, that all thoſe, who as yet continued with them, were true <hi>Believers</hi>) I refer to conſideration. 6, The inference under conteſt yet further ſuppoſeth, that <hi>John</hi> certainly knew, that they, who were now <hi>gone out from them,</hi> neither were now, nor ever before, true <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> yea and that he certainly knew this, by their departure, or going out from them. 7. (And laſtly) it preſumeth yet further, that all true <hi>Believers,</hi> doe alwayes abide in the externall Communion of the <hi>Church;</hi> and that when Men doe not ſo abide, they plainly declare hereby, that they never were true <hi>Believers.</hi> Which is not only a manifeſt untruth, but expreſly contrary to the Doctrine it ſelf of thoſe Men, who aſſert the inference. For they teach (as we heard before) <hi>that even true Believers may fall ſo foule, and ſo far, that the Church according to the command of Christ may be constrained to teſtifie, that ſhee cannot tolerate them in her externall Communion, nor that ever they ſhall have any part or Portion in the Kingdome of Chriſt, unleſſe they repent.</hi> Doubtleſſe to be caſt out of the Church, <hi>according to the Inſtitution and command</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who commands no ſuch thing, but upon very heynous and highly-un-<hi>Chriſtian</hi> miſdemeanours, is of every whit as ſad an importance, as a voluntary deſertion of the <hi>Churches</hi> Communion can be, eſpecially for a ſeaſon. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe theſe two ſuppoſitions be granted to the Inference-Makers,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> 1. That this Phraſe, <hi>to goe out from us,</hi> ſignifies voluntarily to forſake the Society or Communion of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and 2. That this expreſſion, <hi>to be of us,</hi> ſignifies true and inward Communion with thoſe, <hi>from whom they went
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94900:114"/> out,</hi> yet will not theſe contributions ſuffice for the firme building of the ſaid Inference. The reaſon is, becauſe the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith, that <hi>they would have continued</hi> WITH Us, not, that they would have <hi>continued</hi> ſuch as they were, in reſpect of the truth or eſſence of their <hi>Faith.</hi> And if the Apoſtles ſcope in this place were, to prove, or affirme, that they who are once true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or <hi>Believers,</hi> alwayes continue ſuch, then when He ſaith, <hi>they would have continued with us,</hi> He muſt of neceſſity mean, either that they would have <hi>continued</hi> faithfull, as we <hi>continue</hi> faithfull: or elſe, that they would have <hi>continued</hi> alwayes in our Society, or in the Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi> But that neither of theſe ſences are of any tolerable conſiſtency, is evident by the light of this conſideration; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apoſtle then muſt have known, that the perſons He ſpeaks of, <hi>and who went out from them,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were, nor ever had been, true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> or <hi>Believers,</hi> when they thus <hi>went from them.</hi> Now if He had this knowledge of them, it muſt be ſuppoſed, either that He had it by extraordinary Revelation: but this is very unprobable, and howſoever, can never be proved; or elſe that He gained or obtained it by their departure, or <hi>going out from them.</hi> But that this could be no ſufficient Argument or Ground to beget any ſuch knowledge in the Apoſtle concerning them, is evident from hence, becauſe it may very eaſily, and doth very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, come to paſſe, that they who are true <hi>Christians,</hi> doe not alwayes <hi>continue</hi> in that <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Society, unto which they have once joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and adhered; no nor yet in the externall Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf. Yea, our Oppoſers themſelves frequently and without ſcruple teach, and affirme, that even true <hi>Believers</hi> themſelves, may, either through fear, or ſhame, or extremity of ſufferings, or the like, be brought to deny <hi>Christ,</hi> and without any danger of making ſhipwrack of their <hi>Faith,</hi> forbear a Profeſſion-making of the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> afterwards. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (For the true meaning of the Place) it is to be conſidered, that the<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> Apoſtles intent in the words, was to prevent, or heale an offence, that weak <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might take, at that Doctrine, which was taught and ſpread abroad, by thoſe <hi>Anti-Christs,</hi> or Anti-Chriſtian Teachers, (ſpoken of in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Verſe,</hi> and there ſaid to have been, <hi>many</hi>) and that eſpecially becauſe they had ſometimes lived and converſed with the Apoſtles themſelves in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches; and had profeſſed the ſame Faith and Doctrine with them. By reaſon hereof ſome <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not ſo conſiderate or judicious, as others, might poſſibly think, or conceive, that ſurely all things were not well with the Apoſtles, and thoſe <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Societies, with which they conſorted; there was ſomething not as it ought to have been, either in Doctrine, or Manners, or both, which miniſtered an occaſion unto theſe Men to break Communion with them, and to leave them. To this the Apoſtle anſwers partly by Conceſſion: partly by Exception. Firſt by Conceſſion, in theſe words, <hi>They went out from us.</hi> Which words doe not ſo much import their utter declining or forſaking the Apoſtles Communion (though there be an expreſſion following which probably doth) as the advantage or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which they had to gaine credit and reſpects both to their Doctrine, and Perſons, amongſt Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in the World, in as much as <hi>they came forth</hi> from the Apoſtles themſelves, as Men taught, and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by them to Teach. The ſame Phraſe is uſed in this ſence, and with the ſame import, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24. where the Apoſtles write thus to the Brethren of the Gentiles: <hi>For as much as we have heard, that certaine which</hi> WENT OVT FROM Us, <hi>have troubled you with words, ſubverting your Soules, ſaying, yee
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94900:114"/> muſt be Circumciſed, and keep the Law, to whom we gave no ſuch</hi> [Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or] <hi>Commanaement.</hi> So that in this clauſe, <hi>they went out from us,</hi> the Apoſtle grants, 1. That thoſe <hi>Anti-Chriſtian</hi> Teachers had indeed for a time held Communion with them: and 2. That hereby they had the greater op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing harm in the World by their falſe Doctrine. But 2. He anſwers further, by way of exception: <hi>But they were not of us, i. e.</hi> Whileſt yet they converſed with us, they were not Men of the ſame Spirit or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with us; we walked in the Profeſſion of the Goſpell with ſingle and upright Hearts, not aiming at any ſecular greatneſſe, or worldly accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in one kinde or other: theſe Men loved this preſent World; and when they found that the ſimplicity of the Goſpell would not accommodate them to their minds, they brake with us, and with the truth of the Goſpell it ſelf, at once. By the way, when He ſaith, <hi>But they were not of us,</hi> He doth not neceſſarily imply, or ſuppoſe, that they never had been <hi>of them, i. e.</hi> ſincere and ſingle-hearted in the Profeſſion of the Goſpell, as they were: but only that about, and at, the time of their going out from them, or perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while after, they were thus tainted and corrupted. <hi>The cares of this World, and the deceitfulneſſe of Riches, and thoſe luſts of other things, which choked the</hi> ſeed in the <hi>Thorny gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nor is it ſaid to have <hi>fallen among Thorns,</hi> becauſe there were Thorns on the ground, when it was ſown, but becauſe it <hi>fell</hi> on ſuch a ground, where it Proved to be <hi>amongſt Thorns</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Nor is it like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Demas</hi> Himſelf <hi>loved this preſent World,</hi> when firſt he imbraced <hi>Pauls</hi> company, with that affection, either for kinde, or degree, which he did afterwards. So that it cannot be Proved from this clauſe, that the Perſons ſpoken of, had never been ſincere <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but only that they were not ſuch, when <hi>John</hi> ſpake theſe things concerning them. It followes: <hi>For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.</hi> In theſe words, the Apoſtle gives a reaſon of his exception; telling them to whom he writs, that this was a ſigne, or argument, that thoſe <hi>Anti-Chriſtian</hi> Teachers <hi>were not of them</hi> (in the ſence declared) <hi>viz. that they did not continue with them, i. e.</hi> they quitted their former intimacy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the Apoſtles, refuſed to ſteere the ſame courſe to walk by the ſame Principles any longer with them; which (ſaith he) queſtionleſſe they would not have done, had they been as ſincerly affected towards <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Goſpell as we. In which Aſſertion, <hi>John</hi> plainely vindicateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the <hi>Christian Churches</hi> of his Communion, from giving any juſt occaſion of offence unto thoſe men, whereby they ſhould be any wayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to forſake them; and reſolves their unworthy departure in this kinde into their own carnall and corrupt hearts, which luſted after ſuch fleſhly accommodations and contentments, that were not to be obtained, or injoyed, in a ſincere Profeſſion of the Goſpell, with the Apoſtles, and thoſe who were Perfect in heart with them.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 24.</note> 
               <hi>might be made manifeſt that they are not at all of us,</hi> meaning, that God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them thus unworthily to break fellowſhip with us, that hereby they might all of them, one or other of thoſe, who thus cauſleſly deſerted us, be diſcovered to be Men of degenerous and ignoble ſpirits, and not Principled like unto us, the true Apoſtles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or thoſe that walke in uprightneſſe of heart with us. It appertaines to the juſt and righteous Judgement of God, and withall is a diſpenſation of a gracious tendency and import
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94900:115"/> for the Honour, Peace, and Safety of <hi>Chriſtian Churches,</hi> and ſincere <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that Men of corrupt minds amongſt them, ſhould be timely diſcovered.</p>
            <p>This being the cleere and undoubted Scope, and Sence of the Place, evident it is, that no inference or concluſion can be drawn from it for the countenance or eſtabliſhment of the received Doctrine of Perſeverance. All that can be made of it towards ſuch an account as this, is, that Men ſincerely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards the Goſpell, and free from that adulterous and inordinate love of this preſent World, which turns ſuch multitudes aſide from the way of Truth, whileſt they abide in this Poſture and Frame, are ſeldome or never found to deſert the Society of faithfull Teachers, or ſound <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But concerning any abſolute neceſſity of their continuing free, who either have been free, or are free at Preſent, from the inordinate love of the World, here is not the leaſt overture or intimation. Yea, the non-conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of thoſe falſe-Teachers with <hi>John,</hi> and the good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with Him here ſpoken of, though it argues and imports a worldly and dangerous diſtemper in their Hearts and Spirits, yet doth it not neceſſarily or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively imply a nullity of their <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Text of Scripture, from whence the Doctrine of Perſeverance<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> claimes countenance and credit, is that which ſpeaketh thus: <hi>whoſoever is borne of God, doth not commit ſin: for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is borne of God</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </gap> Joh. 3. 9.</note>. From hence ſuch an Argument as this is levied in defence of the ſaid Doctrine.</p>
            <q>He that ſinneth not, neither can ſin, cannot fall away from His Faith: Whoſoever is borne of God, ſinneth not, neither can ſin. Therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is borne of God, cannot fall away from His Faith.</q>
            <p>To this I anſwer by diſtinguiſhing thoſe terms, <hi>ſinneth not, neither can ſin,</hi> made uſe of in both Propoſitions. Firſt, by <hi>ſinneth not,</hi> may be meant, committeth no act of ſin, ſinneth not at all. In this ſence of the Phraſe, the Minor is abſolutely untrue. For he <hi>that is borne of God,</hi> certainely <hi>ſinneth</hi> (in a ſence) <hi>i. e.</hi> committeth acts, yea many acts, of ſin. <hi>In many things</hi> (ſaith <hi>James) we offend all</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">James 3. 2.</note>; meaning, even the holieſt and moſt regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of all. Secondly, by <hi>ſinneth not,</hi> may be meant, (ſay ſome) doth not perpetrate, or commit ſin with delight. But this ſence (I am confident) cannot be juſtified, either from the Scripture, nor yet upon any competent ground of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaſon. <hi>Not to ſin,</hi> doth no where in Scripture ſignifie, not to ſin with delight. I acknowledge, that Words and Phraſes are ſometimes in Scripture uſed emphatically; in which caſes, over and beſides their Proper ſignifications, they conſignifie ſome Peculiarity of manner, or ſome ſpeciall circumſtance relating to the thing or action expreſſed. But what they ſignifie in this kinde (I mean, over and beſides their ſtrict and Proper ſignifications) is not arbitrary, or left for Men to make what they pleaſe; but is to be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the ſcope of the place, and Nature of the matter in hand. I eaſily grant, that the words under debate, <hi>ſinneth not, or doth not commit ſin,</hi> are emphaticall in the Scripture before us. But that the emphaſis lieth in any ſuch modification, which ſhould give them this ſence, <hi>ſinneth not with delight,</hi> hath no good accord with reaſon, or with truth. For there are many <hi>borne of God,</hi> who do <hi>Commit ſin</hi> with delight: yea the delight or pleaſure which they take in many <hi>ſins committed</hi> by them, is the chiefe, if not the only reaſon why they <hi>commit them.</hi> Yea, it is a queſtion, whether any man commits any ſin whatſoever without <hi>delight,</hi> in one kinde or other.</p>
            <pb n="193" facs="tcp:94900:115"/>
            <p>Thirdly, by, <hi>ſinneth not,</hi> is meant (ſay others) <hi>ſinneth not</hi> deliberately,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> or without inward reluctation, in the act of ſinning. But neither hath this ſence any better bottome, then conjecture, (and this obnoxious enough to him that will chew, and not ſwallow:) For, 1. What neceſſity is there, that when <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>he that is borne of God, doth not commit ſin,</hi> he ſhould mean, <hi>committeth</hi> it not with deliberation, or premeditation, or without reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? why may not his meaning as well be, <hi>doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not commit ſin</hi> unto Death? or, cuſtomarily, as other Men doe, or the like? 2. Certaine it is, that <hi>he that is borne of God,</hi> doth, (at leaſt ſometimes) <hi>commit Sin</hi> with delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea and (in the Apoſtles expreſſion) <hi>makes proviſion for the fleſh</hi>

               <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 34.</note>; beſides examples in this kinde, which every day (almoſt) brings forth. 3. Neither is it true, that <hi>every one that is borne of God, Sinneth</hi> alwayes, when he doth <hi>Sin,</hi> with inward reluctancy. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>David</hi> was not divided in himſelf, ſuffered no inward conflict about the <hi>committing</hi> of thoſe ſins lately intimated, conſidering that (according to the generall opinion of our beſt Proteſtant Expoſitors and Divines) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for about the ſpace of an whole yeere after the committing of theſe ſins, without any ſence of, or remorſe for, them. And if the <hi>Lord</hi> had not <hi>ſent his Prophet Nathan</hi> unto him, to awaken him, who knows but that he might have ſlept in his guilt even unto Death? Beſides, as concerning ſins <hi>quotidiani incurſus,</hi> or ſins of infirmity (as they are commonly called) which are incident to thoſe that are <hi>borne of God,</hi> as well as unto others, the caſe is yet more evident; <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe, at leaſt many of them, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by them without any ſuch inward reluctancy, as the Expoſition now oppoſed ſuggeſteth; and particularly thoſe, of which they have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or ſence, when they commit them. 4. (And laſtly, to this) ſuppoſe it were granted, that Men <hi>borne of God</hi> doe not <hi>Sin</hi> but with inward reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet that this is not the ſence wherein the Apoſtle aſcribes a <hi>non-Sinning</hi> unto them, is evident from hence; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe certaine it is, that the <hi>non-Sinning</hi> here intended by him to be aſcribed unto them, is ſuch, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to them, and not communicable to wicked or unregenerate Men. But that Men unregenerate, ſin, and that frequently, with inward reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is the frequent acknowledgement of theſe Men themſelves; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides is of eaſie Deduction and Obſervation from <hi>Romans 1. 32. Romans</hi> 2. 1. 5. &amp;c. Nor is it, nor can it reaſonably, be denied by our Adverſaries themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that he that is borne of God doth not commit</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Sin,</hi> ſome underſtand it of <hi>committing Sin</hi> unto death, or with finall impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency. This Expoſition indeed, if it could be made to ſtand upright, would beare the weight of the controverſie depending alone. But it argues much weakneſſe for a Man, in an Expoſition of Scripture to determine for his own ſence in a controverſie or queſtion, without giving a very ſubſtantiall reaſon of ſuch his Expoſition. Now I can meet with no reaſon at all from the Aſſertors of this Expoſition, for the confirmation of it. But reaſons againſt it there are theſe three at hand, and many more in comeing. 1. The Grammar or Letter of the Phraſe breatheth not the leaſt aire of ſuch a ſence. 2. The Phraſe of <hi>committing Sin</hi> is no where in Scripture found in ſuch a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94900:116"/> ſence; I meane, to ſin with finall impenitency, or unto death. The Authors of the Expoſition have not yet ſhewed it, nor (I believe) ever will. 3. Nor doth the Context, or Scope of the place any wayes invite, much leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, ſuch an Expoſition. The intent and drift of the Apoſtle from <hi>ver.</hi> 3. even to the end of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> (as he that doth but <hi>run</hi> the Context over, <hi>may read</hi>) is not to ſhew, or argue, whether the <hi>Sons of God</hi> may poſſibly in time ſo degenerate, as to live ſinfully, and die impenitently; but to evince this, that thoſe who claime the great Honour and Priviledge of being the children of God, cannot juſtifie or make good this claime, neither unto others, nor to themſelves, but by an holy and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> life and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now it is one thing to argue or prove, who are the Sons of God at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: another, whether, they, who are ſuch at preſent, muſt of neceſſity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſo continue. The former, is the Apoſtles Theme in the Context: the latter he is wholly ſilent unto. So then if by <hi>not Sinning,</hi> the Argument which we have now upon anſwer, underſtands the non-committing of any of theſe foure kinds of ſin, or a <hi>non-Sinning</hi> upon any of the terms explained, the minor propoſition is denied, which ſaith, <hi>that whoſoever is borne of God, ſinneth not:</hi> nor doth the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> affirm it (as hath been cleerly ſhewed) in any ſuch ſence.</p>
            <p>If by <hi>Sinneth not,</hi> the Argument meaneth, walketh not ordinarily, or<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> cuſtomarily in any known way, or courſe, of ſin; maketh not (as it were) a Trade or Occupation of ſinning (which we have formerly proved to be the ſence of the Phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the Scriptures, and more particularly in the writings of this Apoſtle <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 9. Sect. 11.</note>) the ſaid minor propoſition is granted, as to this clauſe: <hi>whoſoever is borne of God, Sinneth not.</hi> For that further clauſe in it, <hi>neither can Sin;</hi> this alſo, as to the Scripture uſe of the words, <hi>can,</hi> and <hi>cannot,</hi> is very ambiguous, and of doubtfull ſignification. For, 1. a Man may be ſaid to <hi>can,</hi> or to be able to doe a thing, when the thing is meet, or comely for him to doe: and in oppoſition hereunto, when a thing is uncomely or unmeet to be done by him, it may be ſaid of him (in Scripture Phraſe) that he <hi>cannot</hi> doe it. <hi>How then</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to his miſtriſſe) CAN <hi>I doe this great wickedneſſe, and Sin againſt God</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 39. 9</note>? which is as if he had plainly ſaid, <hi>I cannot</hi> doe it. So againe: <hi>Can the children of the bride-chamber mourne,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Christ) as long as the Bridegroome is with them</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 9. 15</note>? meaning, that it was an irrationall or uncomely thing for them ſo to doe; and in this reſpect (ſaith he) they <hi>cannot</hi> doe it. Thus <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 26. where our Engliſh Tranſlators reade, <hi>It is not meet ſo to doe, Ierom</hi> Tranſlated it, <hi>Non potest ita fieri, i. e.</hi> it cannot ſo be done.

Secondly, a perſon may be ſaid to <hi>can,</hi> or to be able to doe ſuch or ſuch a thing, when being otherwiſe provided of ſtrength ſufficient, He is under a preſent diſpoſition or inclination of minde and will to do it. In this ſence the Lord Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>can,</hi> or to be <hi>able to have compaſsion on the ignorant, Heb.</hi> 5. 2. and in oppoſition hereunto, when a Man wants ſuch a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, eſpecially when a contrary diſpoſition rules in him, it may (in Scripture language) be ſaid of him, that he <hi>cannot</hi> do it.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94900:116"/> for otherwiſe his naturall, or executive, power of doing <hi>mighty workes,</hi> was the ſame here, which it was in other places. So he demands of the <hi>Phariſes, How</hi> CAN <hi>yee, being evill, ſpeake good things</hi>

Again, ſpeaking to the ſame Generation of Men, he demands, <hi>Why doe yee not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand my ſpeech?</hi> and anſwers his own queſtion thus: <hi>even becauſe yee</hi> CANNOT <hi>hear my Word</hi>

               <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 19. 11</note>. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> meaning that it was very difficult for ſome Men to acknowledge the goodneſſe of that ſaying in reference to themſelves, or to refraine marrying. For that it was not, or is not, ſimply impoſſible for any Man in this ſence to receive the ſaid <hi>ſaying.</hi> or to judge the forbearance of marriage <hi>good</hi> for him, and to forbeare accordingly, is in ſelfe evident; and beſides, may be inferr'd from theſe words of our Saviour following: <hi>and there be Eunuches, which have made themſelves Eunuches for the Kingdome of Heavens ſake. He that is able to receive it, (i. e.</hi> whoſe heart ſerves him to encounter, and engage againſt the difficulty, and ſhall overcome it) let <hi>him receive it: i. e.</hi> Let him forbeare to marry. For concerning thoſe. of whom he ſaith, <hi>that they have made themſelves Eunuches for, &amp;c.</hi> evident it is, that he meaneth not by them, either ſuch, who by nature are indiſpoſed to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, nor ſuch, upon whom an incapacity in this kinde hath been forced (for of theſe he had ſpoken plainely in the former part of the Verſe;) but of ſuch, who had over-ruled and vanquiſhed their inclinations and deſires that way, by the weight and great import of ſpirituall conſiderations, proper to obtain a conqueſt of that nature. In this ſence alſo <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Bethel</hi> ſaith concerning the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> that <hi>the Land is not able to</hi> [or, cannot] <hi>beare all his words</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Amos 7. 10</note>: <hi>i. e.</hi> can hardly <hi>beare</hi> them, without falling ſoule up on him becauſe of them. So when our Saviour ſaith: <hi>A City that is ſet on an Hill,</hi> CANNOT <hi>be hid</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 5. 14</note>, he doth not import an abſolute impoſſibility of the <hi>hiding</hi> of it (for doubtleſſe there may be means found out to <hi>hide</hi> a <hi>City</hi> ſo ſcituate, as well as another ſtanding in a valley,) but only a difficulty thereof <note n="*" place="margin">See alſo Gen. 32. 12 Gen. 45. 1. Exod. 7. 21. 24.</note>. Fourthly, the Word or Phraſe we ſpeak of, <hi>cannot,</hi> ſometimes imports only a preſent incapacity in a Perſon, for the doing of a thing, when there is a remote Principle or Power in him notwithſtanding to doe it. Thus God Himſelf ſaith to his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel, Thou art not ſent to a People of a ſtrange ſpeech, or of an hard language, whoſe words thou</hi> CANST NOT <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ezek. 3. 6</note>: implying that there were ſome People, whoſe words he <hi>could not understand,</hi> viz. <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> for the preſent: not but that there was a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of reaſon and underſtanding in him, by the improvement whereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, he might come in time to be very able to <hi>underſtand</hi> them. Thus it is ſaid of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Magitians, <hi>that they</hi> COVLD NOT STAND <hi>before Moſes [viz.</hi> at preſent] <hi>becauſe of the Boyles</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 9. 11</note>: but theſe notwithſtanding,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94900:117"/> they were in a capacity of ſtanding before him another time as, <hi>viz.</hi> when they ſhould be healed of their <hi>Boyles.</hi> Thus, it is ſaid <hi>that the Children of Iſrael</hi> COVLD NOT <hi>ſtand before their enemies</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Judg 7. 12</note>, <hi>viz.</hi> whileſt <hi>Achans</hi> ſin was unpuniſhed amongſt them: yet were they remotely capable, not only of <hi>ſtanding before their enemies,</hi> but of vanquiſhing, yea and making their <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> flie before them. Fifthly, (and laſtly) the Phraſe, <hi>cannot</hi> frequently importeth an abſolute impotency, or incapacity in Perſons in reference to the doing of ſuch, or ſuch a thing. Thus our Saviour (ſpeaking of His ſheep.) No <hi>Man</hi> [or, none] CAN <hi>take th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now if the clauſe, <hi>cannot ſin,</hi> in the Argument propounded, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> according to any of the foure firſt ſignification mentioned of the word, <hi>cannot,</hi> both the Propoſitions are falſe: if according to the fifth and laſt, the major is true, but the minor falſe. The major Propoſition was this: <hi>He that ſinneth not,</hi> NEITHER CAN SIN, <hi>cannot fall away from his Faith.</hi> 1. If by the deniall of a Power to <hi>ſin,</hi> in this Propoſition (which that clauſe, <hi>neither can ſin,</hi> importeth) be meant nothing elſe, but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meetneſſe, or uncomlineſſe for a Man to Sin, it is a cleer caſe that He that <hi>cannot ſin,</hi> may, notwithſtanding ſuch a want of Power to <hi>ſin,</hi> very poſſibly <hi>fall away from his Faith.</hi> For thouſands may doe, yea and doe, things very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet and uncomely to be done by them. 2. If by a deniall of the ſaid Power in the Propoſition, be meant a preſent indiſpoſition or incapacity in a Man to Sin by reaſon of the contrary diſpoſition of holineſſe prevailing in Him, in this ſence alſo He that <hi>cannot Sin,</hi> may very poſſibly fall away from His <hi>Faith.</hi> For He, in whom a diſpoſition of holineſſe is predominant at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, may very poſſibly by degrees, and through a frequency and cuſtome of contrary actions (if not by an impetuous and ſuddaine turne alſo of Heart within Him,) deveſt Himſelf of that honourable habit, and put on the vile garments of Looſeneſſe and Prophaneſſe in the ſtead. 3. If by, <hi>cannot Sin,</hi> the Argument meaneth can hardly <hi>Sin,</hi> or <hi>cannot Sin</hi> without difficulty (which was the third ſignification of the word, <hi>cannot</hi>) neither will this ſence give any colour of truth to the ſaid Propoſition. For He that <hi>can</hi> hardly Sin, or not <hi>Sin</hi> without difficulty, may yet poſſibly <hi>Sin:</hi> and conſequently, ſuch an inability to <hi>Sin</hi> notwithſtanding, <hi>fall away from his Faith.</hi> 4. If by <hi>cannot Sin,</hi> the Argument imports, only a preſent incapacity of <hi>ſinning</hi> in the Perſon, not excluding a remote capacity in Him hereunto, and ſuch as may in time, by means ſuteable, be reduced into act, evident it is, that the Perſon, this inability to <hi>Sin</hi> notwithſtanding, may poſſibly <hi>fall away from his Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, 2. according to all theſe Significations and Importances of the<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> clauſe, <hi>cannot Sin,</hi> in the ſaid Syllogiſme, the other Propoſition alſo is falſe, which ſaith, that <hi>whoſoever is borne of God ſinneth not, neither</hi> CAN SIN. For, 1. <hi>He that is borne of God,</hi> may very poſſibly doe that, which is uncomely and unmeet for Him to doe. 2. May be able to doe that by the ſuperveening, or contracting of another habit upon Him, which by reaſon of a contrary habit prevailing upon Him for a time, He <hi>cannot</hi> doe. 3. He may poſſibly doe that, which only is hard or difficult for Him to doe. 4. (And
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:94900:117"/> laſtly) He may have a remote capacity in Him of doing that in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in time, (and conſequently, may doe it) which at preſent He is under an inability to doe. Therefore it is a cleare caſe, that there are four ſeverall Significations of the Word, <hi>cannot,</hi> (and theſe frequent in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) wherein both the Propoſitions, in the argument now under canvaſs, is falſe.</p>
            <p>If the ſaid argument underſtands the Phraſe, <hi>cannot Sin,</hi> according to the<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> fifth and laſt import mentioned of the Word, <hi>cannot,</hi> wherein it ſounds an utter and abſolute incapacity, or impoſſibility; though in this ſence the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Propoſition be granted, <hi>viz. that he that doth not Sin, nor can Sin, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall away from his Faith,</hi> yet the minor is tardy, which ſaith (as we lately heard) <hi>whoſoever is borne of God Sinneth not, neither can Sin.</hi> For He that <hi>is borne of God,</hi> is in no ſuch incapacity of <hi>Sinning</hi> (of <hi>Sinning</hi> I mean, in the ſence formerly aſſerted to the Scripture in hand) which amounts to an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute impoſſibility for Him ſo to <hi>Sin.</hi> But becauſe this ſeems to be the ſence intended in the argument, and the minor Propoſition (in this ſence) to be built upon the Scripture in hand, let us conſider, whether the reaſon, which this Scripture aſſignes for the ſaid aſſertion, <hi>Whoſoever is borne of God, cannot ſin,</hi> doth neceſſarily inforce ſuch a ſence thereof. The tenor of the whole Verſe is this: <hi>Whoſoever is borne of God, doth not commit ſin: for his ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him: and he cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> ſin, becauſe he is borne of God.</hi> Here are two Propoſitions or Aſſertions laid down; and a reaſon given of either of them reſpectively. The former Propoſition is this; <hi>Whoſoever is borne of God, doth not commit ſin:</hi> The reaſon hereof, is: <hi>for his ſeed remaineth in him:</hi> The latter Propoſition, this; <hi>Whoſoever is borne of God, cannot ſin:</hi> The reaſon hereof is: <hi>becauſe he is borne of God.</hi> The ſence, and difference, of the two Propoſitions (according to what we have argued about the place hitherto, and what we judge) is this: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>every one that hath been borne of God, ſtnneth not, i. e.</hi> whoſoever hath by the Word and Spirit of God been made <hi>partaker of the Divine Nature,</hi> ſo as to reſemble God in the frame and conſtitution of his Heart and Soule, doth not under ſuch a frame or change of Heart as this, make a Trade or Practiſe of ſinning, or walke in any courſe of inordinateneſſe in the World: yea (ſaith He, in the latter Propoſition) every ſuch Perſon, doth not only, or ſimply, refraine <hi>ſinning</hi> (in ſuch a ſence) but He <hi>cannot ſin, i. e.</hi> He hath a ſtrong and potent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in him, which carrieth Him another way; or He hath a ſtrong an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy or averſeneſſe of Heart and Soule, againſt all <hi>ſin,</hi> eſpecially againſt all ſuch kinde of <hi>ſinning.</hi> Now the reaſon (ſaith the Apoſtle) why ſuch a Perſon <hi>committeth not Sin</hi> (in the ſence explained,) is, becauſe <hi>his ſeed, [the ſeed</hi> of God, by, or of, which He was <hi>borne</hi> of Him] <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in Him, i. e.</hi> (according to the frequent ſignification of the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to abide, or remaine, in the Writings of this Apoſtle) is, or hath an actuall and preſent being, or reſidence in Him. And that in this place it doth not ſignifie any perpetuall remaining or abiding, no nor any abiding with relation to the future, is evident; becauſe the <hi>abiding</hi> of the <hi>ſeed</hi> here ſpoken of, is given as the reaſon, why He that is borne of God, doth <hi>not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin: i. e.</hi> doth not at preſent walke in any courſe of known ſin. Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in reſpect of any future Permanency, or continuance of being, can be looked upon as a cauſe of any preſent effect, but only in reſpect of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent being or reſidence of it. The reaſon why the Soul moves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and acts the Body to day, is not becauſe it will move or act it to morrow, or becauſe it
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94900:118"/> is in the Body to day upon ſuch terms, that it will be in it to morrow alſo; much leſſe becauſe it is an immortall ſubſtance, or the like, but ſimply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is now, or this day, in the Body. So the reaſon why the Angells at this day doe the Will of God, is not becauſe they have ſuch a Principle of Holineſſe, or Obedience veſted in them, which they cannot put off, or loſe to Eternity, but becauſe they have ſuch a Principle, as we ſpeak of, (of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and Obedience) reſiding in them at the preſent. Therefore when <hi>John</hi> aſſignes, <hi>the remaining of the ſeed</hi> of God in Him, <hi>that is borne of him,</hi> for the reaſon, why He <hi>doth not commit ſin,</hi> certaine it is, that by this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of the ſeed,</hi> He means nothing elſe but the preſent reſidence, or abode thereof in this Perſon. And if his intent had been, either to aſſert, or imply, a perpetuall reſidence of this <hi>ſeed</hi> in Him that is <hi>borne of God,</hi> it had been much more proper for Him to have reſerved it, for a reaſon of the latter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>viz.</hi> why <hi>He that is borne of God, cannot ſin</hi> (eſpecially according to their ſence, who by, <hi>cannot ſin,</hi> underſtand, <hi>can</hi> never <hi>ſin</hi>) then to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne it as a reaſon of the former. For though the future continuance of a thing in being, can be no reaſon (as hath been ſaid) of a preſent effect, yet may it well be a Ground or Reaſon of the continuance of a preſent effect.</p>
            <p>Now that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to remaine, or abide, frequently ſignifieth (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the Writings of this Apoſtle) only a preſent reſidence, or being,<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> whether of a Perſon, or Thing, without any reference unto, or implicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, a future, appeares by many inſtances. <hi>But yee know him</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples, ſpeaking of the <hi>Spirit) <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Beſides, that in the place in hand, it muſt needs ſignifie, only a preſent abode, or being, not a future, or perpetuall, is evident from hence; becauſe ſuch a ſignification of it, would render a ſence altogether inconſiſtent with the plaine ſcope of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in the Context, which is, to exhort <hi>Chriſtians</hi> unto Righteouſneſſe and love of the Brethren. Now it is contrary to all reaſon, yea to common ſence it ſelf, to ſignifie unto thoſe, whom we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, exhort, and perſwade to any duty, any ſuch thing, which imports an ablolute certainty, or neceſſity of their doing it, whether they take care, or uſe any meanes for the doing it. or no.

            <p>If it be here objected and ſaid; yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the <hi>ſeed,</hi> of which thoſe that are<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> borne of God, are begotten, is ſaid to be an <hi>immortall,</hi> or <hi>incorruptible ſeed</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 23</note>: and therefore cannot periſh or decay in thoſe, who are begotten of it, or in whom it ever takes place. I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſeed, which the Holy Ghoſt affirms to be, <hi>not corruptible, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible,</hi> is expreſly ſaid to be, <hi>the Word of God</hi>

For as that <hi>ſeed,</hi> which is <hi>corruptible,</hi> is not therefore termed <hi>corruptible,</hi> becauſe it may be transferr'd or removed from the ſubject or ſoyle, wherein it remaines at preſent, but becauſe, according to the Nature and Elementary conſtitution of it, it may be corrupted, and ſuffer a change of being; as alſo becauſe it is naturally apt to produce and yeild ſuch bodies or things, which according to the courſe of Nature are corruptible likewiſe: in like manner the ſeed of the Word of God is not therefore ſaid to be an <hi>incorruptible ſeed,</hi> becauſe it cannot be taken from, or forſaken by, thoſe, in whom it hath a reſidence for the preſent; but becauſe, whether it be taken, or not taken from, whether it be forſaken, or not forſaken by, theſe, it retaines its proper Nature, which is to be <hi>incorruptible.</hi> For it is meerly extrinſecall and accidentall to the Word of God, to be either imbraced, or refuſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be either retained, or let goe or loſt, by Men: nor doe any of theſe things make the leaſt alteration in the nature of it, no more then the taking up, or removing a corne of Wheat, or of any other corruptible graine, from the Ground or Field, wherein at preſent it reſteth, or the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it there alone; altereth the Nature or Eſſentiall Properties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

Secondly, the effect here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to it, the keeping or preſerving of the Man, in whom it remaines, from <hi>ſinning,</hi> which requires a Principle of very great Strength and Power to effect, implieth the ſame. Now ſuch a Principle, <hi>genius,</hi> or quality in a Man, as the Holy Ghoſt calls, <hi>the Divine Nature,</hi> may well be conceived to be very ſpiritfull and vigorouſly operative according to the kinde and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of it, in which reſpect it is frequently termed, <hi>Spirit;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be ſufficiently active and powerfull to preſerve its ſubject from <hi>ſinning.</hi> Yea, our Apoſtle, in aſſigning the reaſon of his latter Aſſertion in this place, which is, <hi>that he that is borne of God, cannot Sin,</hi> the reaſon whereof he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to be this, <hi>becauſe he is borne of God,</hi> ſuppoſeth the <hi>ſeed</hi> here ſpoken of (whatſoever is meant by it) to be ſo actuous and powerfull, that it doth, not only actually and <hi>de facto</hi> preſerve him, in whom it remaines, from <hi>Sinning,</hi> but alſo renders him impotent or unable to ſin. For this reaſon, <hi>becauſe he is borne of God,</hi> is the ſame in effect, and for ſubſtance, with that of the former aſſertion; <hi>for his ſeed abideth in him:</hi> only it doth ſomewhat more emphatically import, that the reaſon why the <hi>Seed of God</hi> remaining in a Man, is ſo potently excluſive of ſin in the ſame ſubject, with it, is the abſolute Holineſſe, or moſt perfect hatred of ſin, which is in God Himſelf, of whom the Perſon is begotten againe, by ſuch his <hi>ſeed.</hi> As the reaſon why a Lion hath courage, ſtrength, and other like leonine Properties, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he came of a Lion, a Creature naturally endued with the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. But whatſoever is here meant by the <hi>Seed of God,</hi> whether the Word of God, or the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> (ſo notioned as hath been deſcribed) evident it is, by what hath been argued, that no inſeparableneſſe of it from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubject, (nor conſequently any impoſſibility of falling away from <hi>Faith,</hi>) can be inferr'd from any thing ſpoken of it, as attributed to it, in this Place.</p>
            <p>There is only one objection more (as far as I am able to apprehend) that<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> lieth with any ſeemingneſſe of ſtrength againſt the Premiſſes. The tenor hereof is this. If the <hi>Seed of God</hi> (whatever it be) <hi>remaining</hi> in a Man rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, worketh in him the greateſt and ſtrongeſt antipathy againſt, or alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and abhorrency of minde and affection from, ſin, that can lightly be imagined (which hath been granted all along in the traverſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in hand) how is it poſſible that ſuch a man ſhould fall away, eſpecially totally and finally, from his <hi>Faith?</hi> It is no wayes reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that it is poſſible for a Man ſo to fall away from his <hi>Faith,</hi> without ſinning, no nor yet without ſinning very grievouſly: nor is it much more reaſonable (if not as unreaſonable altogether) to ſuppoſe, that a Man may ſin, and that grievouſly, who hath the greateſt and ſtrongeſt antipathy againſt ſin, the deepeſt aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and abhorrency of minde and will from ſin, that lightly can be conceived. Therefore how is it poſſible for him that <hi>cannot ſin</hi> (even in this ſence) to fall away totally or finally? I anſwer,</p>
            <p>He that hath the greateſt and ſtrongeſt antipathy againſt ſin, that fleſh
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94900:119"/> and blood is capable of, yet retaines that eſſentiall character, or property of a creature, <hi>mutability,</hi> which ſuppoſeth a poſſibility (at leaſt) of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; if not <hi>in ſenſu compoſito, i. e.</hi> whileſt ſuch an antipathy remaines in its full vigor and ſtrength; yet <hi>in ſenſu Diviſo, i. e.</hi> in caſe, or when, this anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy ſhall abate and decline. As though Water made hot to the higheſt degree of heat whereof the nature of it is capable, cannot poſſible coole any thing, whileſt it remaines under ſuch a degree of heate, yet this hinders not but that it may in time, its preſent heat notwithſtanding, returne to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall coldneſſe, and then coole other things: in like manner, a Man may by the Spirit of Grace and Regeneration, be carried up to a very effectuall and potent antipathy of minde and will againſt Sin, by meanes whereof, he is in no Capacity or Poſſibility of ſinning, (in the ſence formerly declared) whileſt it continues thus effectuall and potent: but the preſent effectualneſſe or Potency of it, in a ſubject that is mutable, and ſucceſſively capable of both contraries, is no ſufficient Argument to Prove, that therefore it muſt needs alwayes continue Effectuall, or Potent, in the ſame degree. And if it may abate or fall one degree, why not another? and if two, why not all; conſidering that all and every Degree hereof is but of one and the ſame Nature?</p>
            <p>If it be here ſaid, yea but ſuch a ſtrong antipathy againſt Sin, as you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> and grant in Regenerate Men, is inconſiſtent with any ſuch abatement, or declining, cannot reaſonably be looked upon as capable of any Falling; Sinking, or Loſing ſo much as one Degree of its ſtrength, in as much as ſuch a Falling or Loſing as this, cannot be without Sin: and till there be ſuch a declining as this in that Holy Principle we ſpeak of, the Perſon is ſuppoſed to be full of the hatred and abomination of Sin. Therefore unleſſe he ſhall be ſuppoſed capable of Sinning even <hi>in ſenſu compoſito, i. e.</hi> whileſt He is yet under the greateſt and moſt perfect hatred and abhorrency of Sin, (which ſeemes to be <hi>dura ſuppoſitio,</hi> and to need good Proof) he muſt be ſuppoſed uncapable of any declining at all in ſuch his Principle, and conſequently much more uncapable of falling away, either totally, or finally. To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That according to the known Sence and Principles of our adverſaries themſelves in the cauſe depending, <hi>Faith</hi> in Men Regenerate, or the Grace of Regeneration it ſelf, to what Degree or Perfection ſoever raiſed or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the ſubject, may notwithſtanding very poſſibly decay or decline, though not totally, or in all the Parts or Degrees of it, yet in ſome, yea in many; yea ſo far, that in appearance it may ſeeme utterly and totally loſt. If ſo, then every Particular Grace in ſuch a Perſon, may poſſibly abate in the ſtrength, and fal from the height of it: and conſequently that antipathy or hatred againſt Sin, which is in him, how perfect ſoever it be, may loſe ground alſo, and abate of its perfection. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we ſuppoſe, or grant, a ſtrong antipathy againſt Sin in thoſe that are <hi>borne of God,</hi> we doe not ſuppoſe withall, either this antipathy to be un-impaireable, or any ſuch Principle, which cannot decline in the ſtrength and Power of it; or that it can be impaired or decline, without Sin in him, who ſuffers an impairement of it to be made in him. When we ſuppoſe the greateſt antipathy againſt Sin in a Man, that fleſh and blood is lightly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, we doe not hereby ſuppoſe him without the reach of temptation, or a Man not ſubject to incogitancies, forgetfulneſſe, and other humane frailties. We may very well (and ought to) ſuppoſe <hi>Solomon</hi> to have been
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94900:120"/> the wiſeſt of Men; and yet ſuppoſe him withall, even in the height and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his wiſdome, to have been a man capable, or under a poſſibility, of doing weakly, or fooliſhly. <hi>Nemo omnibus horis ſapit.</hi> There is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired habit, or created Principle whatſoever, ſeated in the heart or ſoule of a Man, that doth at any time act him, or cauſe him to act congruouſly to it, without the actuall intention of the minde upon, and the like concurrence of the will with, the action. Again, 2. moſt certaine it is, that the minde of a Man, being a finite faculty, cannot intend plurality of objects, actions, or occaſions, at once, or at one and the ſame time. 3. As certaine it is, as either of the former, that neither the minde, nor will of a Man, are compell'd or neceſſitated by any habit, inclination, or diſpoſition whatſoever, alwayes, or, (indeed) at any time, to intend them, or their motions and actings, or to concur with them herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but are in ſome degree (at leaſt) of liberty and power, to tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne aſide from them, to ſeverall other objects and occaſions, as they pleaſe. It is true, habits and inclinations, eſpecially when they are much grown and rooted in the Soul by frequent and long-continued actions, have a great Power over Men to intice and draw them into a frequent repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the ſame kinde of action, by which they were firſt introduced, and whereunto they have ſo long prevailed with ſuch Men to accuſtome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And in reſpect of this Power it is, that the Scripture ſo frequently aſcribes a kinde of morall impotency unto Men to act contrary to the tenor of ſuch actions, whereunto they have much accuſtomed themſelves, yea or to ſuſpend or forbear them upon opportunities: and (upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) repreſents Perſons as ſervants, as in ſubjection and bondage to thoſe reſpective kinds of actions, or courſes, whereunto they have voluntarily inured themſelves for any conſiderable time. Of this notion are ſuch paſſages and ſayings as theſe. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, that whoſoever committeth Sin (i. e.</hi> frequently and cuſtomarily, as we formerly interpreted the import of the Phraſe in the Writings of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>

               <note n="d" place="margin">Jer. 13. 23.</note>. Of like conſideration is that alſo of our Saviour: <hi>A good Tree</hi> CANNOT <hi>bring forth evill fruits: neither</hi> CAN <hi>a corrupt Tree bring forth good fruit</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 7. 18.</note>. (To omit many others.) But, 4. (And laſtly) when the Scripture ſuppoſeth, or aſſerts a morall impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in Men (as in the paſſages now cited, with their fellows) either wholly to ceaſe from their long-accuſtomed actions, or to act contrary to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it neither ſuppoſeth, nor aſſerts, a naturall, ſimple, or abſolute impotency in reſpect of either. For it is the Nature, Property, and Condition of all habits or created Principles in Men whatſoever, by diſcontinuance or long ſuſpenſion of their appropriate actions, to languiſh, and abate of their wonted ſtrength and vigor, and in time, wholly to expire. So then, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill in the Power of the minde and will of a Man, even under the greateſt captivity or ſubjection unto any Habit, Diſpoſition, or Principle whatſoever, whether ſinfull, or holy, to ſuſpend and diſcontinue (as hath been proved) their proper actings reſpectively, by denying or withholding their concurrence with them in order towards ſuch actions, evident it is, that they have Power, and may ſhake and weaken every ſuch Habit, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or Principle in themſelves to what degree they deſire, yea and in time, wholly enervate, diſſipate, and expell them. Therefore it is no <hi>dura a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio,</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:94900:120"/> no hard ſuppoſition, to ſuppoſe, that a Perſon inveſted with the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt antipathy againſt ſin, whereof he is capable, (eſpecially in the State and Condition of mortality) may notwithſtanding, even <hi>in ſenſu compoſito, i. e.</hi> This antipathy ſtanding, either doe that which is ſinfull, but eſpecially omit, or neglect the doing of that, which is his duty, yea and of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment likewiſe unto him, to doe.</p>
            <p>Thus we have at laſt, fully and cleerly (we ſuppoſe) acquitted that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. more vehemently ſuſpected and charged, then all his fellows, with confederacy againſt that Doctrine, which affirms a Poſſibility of a totall and finall defection in the <hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Scripture hath the ſame imputation caſt upon it for ſpeaking<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> only thus: <hi>My Father, which gave them me, is greater then all: and no Man is able to take them out of my Fathers Hand</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 29</note>.

            <p>That by the tenor and carriage of the Context it appeares, 1.

And for a further confirmation, that the life which he promiſeth unto his <hi>Sheepe, hearing his</hi> voyce and <hi>following him [viz.</hi> as was ſaid, perſeveringly] is <hi>eternall</hi> (in the beſt, largeſt, moſt comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, moſt deſireable ſence of the word) he ſubjoynes the words in hand, Verſe 29. <hi>My Father which gave them me, is greater, viz.</hi> in power, <hi>then all: and none is able to pluck them out of my Fathers Hand;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, God Himſelf, by whoſe grace they became my <hi>Sheepe</hi> and followed me, and whoſe power is abundantly ſufficient for the work, would maintaine and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94900:121"/> make good unto them to the uttermoſt, that life, which I ſhall give unto them, againſt all dangers, all enemies, all adverſary powers whatſoever. This being the naturall and cleer diſpoſition of the Context, it is a plaine caſe that here is not the leaſt aire or breathing of any ingagement of the great power of God, to bring about the perſeverance of the <hi>Saints</hi> upon thoſe terms of infallibility, or neceſſity, which are ſo much contended for.</p>
            <p>Another Scripture much intreated in the behalf of the Doctrine of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> is that of the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> concerning our Saviour: <hi>having loved his own, which were in the World, he loved them unto the end</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

By the tenor of this arguing, it would as well follow, that in caſe God ſhould at any time withdraw his love or favour from a Nation, or body of People, which he ſometimes favoured or loved, he ſhould be <hi>changed.</hi> But that no ſuch <hi>change</hi> of diſpenſation as this towards one and the ſame people, or Nation, argueth any <hi>change</hi> at all in God, at leaſt any ſuch <hi>change</hi> which he diſclaimeth as incompetent to him, is evident from thoſe inſtances (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number) recorded in Scripture, of ſuch a different diſpenſation of his, towards ſundry Nations, and more eſpecially towards the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to whom ſometimes he gave peace, ſometimes he conſumed them with wars, ſtirring up enemies againſt them; ſometimes he gave them plenty, other-while he exerciſed them with famine, <hi>and ſcarcity of all things:</hi> ſometimes he made them <hi>the head,</hi> and ſometimes againe <hi>the taile,</hi> of the Nations round about them. Therefore neither the changeableneſſe, nor unchangeableneſſe of God, are to be eſtimated or meaſured, either by any variety, or uniformity, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation towards one and the ſame object; and conſequently, for him to expreſſe himſelf, as this day, towards a perſon, Man or Woman, as if he intended to ſave them, or that he really intends to ſave them, and ſhould on the morrow (as the alteration in the interim may be, or however, may be ſuppoſed, in theſe perſons) expreſſe himſelf to the contrary, as that he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily intends to deſtroy them, would not argue or imply the leaſt change or alteration in him. Yea, when as in one hour he confer'd upon the lapſed Angells the greateſt happineſſe they were capable of, and in the next hour (perhaps ſooner) there ſin interveening, he caſt them out of his ſight into the greateſt miſery, this argued no change, or <hi>ſhadow</hi> of change, or <hi>turning,</hi> in God. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That unchangeableneſſe, which the Scriptures, or God Himſelf in<note place="margin">§. 41.</note> the Scriptures aſſerts unto Himſelf, is to be conſidered only in reſpect of his Eſſence, Attributes, and Decrees, and not in reſpect of any conſtancy, or ſameneſſe of tenor in his diſpenſations towards the ſame Creatures, whether they be changed, or no. Firſt God is unchangeable in his Eſſence, or ſimple
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94900:122"/> Beeing: in reſpect of this, nothing can be added to him, nothing can be taken from him, nothing can be altered, or made otherwiſe, with Him, in Him, or about Him, then now it is, or was, from eternity. This unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him the <hi>Prophet David</hi> contemplated, in this his addreſſe to him: <hi>Of old thou hast laid the foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of thy Hand. They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt indure: yea all of them ſhall wax old like a Garment, as a Veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but thou art the ſame, and thy yeares ſhall have no end</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 102. 25, &amp;c.</note>. Secondly, God is unchangeable likewiſe in reſpect of his attributes (which are all founded in His Nature, Eſſence, or ſimple Beeing) ſo that (for example) he is not more wiſe at one time, and leſſe wiſe at an other, not ſtronger at one time, and weaker at another, nor better at one time, and worſe at another; though it is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he may ſhew more wiſdome (or, to ſpeak more properly, he may ſhew his Wiſdom more, <hi>i. e.</hi> more plainly and perſpicuouſly, as unto Men) in one contriveance, or Providentiall Diſpenſation, then in another, and in this ſence, he may ſhew more Power, and ſo more goodneſſe, at one time, then at another. Yet this different expreſſion of himſelf according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent natures and imports of his Attributes reſpectively, doth not argue any changeableneſſe at all in theſe Attributes. As a Man may be as ſtrong, when he acts little or nothing, with his ſtrength, as when in any action he exerts or puts forth the uttermoſt of it: and ſo may be of as loving and ſweet a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, when according to the exigency of his calling, and conſcience, he moſt ſeverely puniſheth the ſame Perſons, for their miſdemeanours, whom he ſometimes honoured and loved, whileſt he judged them vertuous, as he was, whileſt he yet honoured and loved them. When a Judge, who is of a ſweet nature, and loving diſpoſition towards all Men, conſidered as Men, eſpecially as good Men, ſhall, according to the Laws, whereunto he is ſworne, and the equity of the Caſe, award a Sentence of Death againſt one, or more of them, this no wayes argueth, or ſuppoſeth, any alteration or change in his goodneſſe, or ſweetneſſe of diſpoſition; he may be, nay it is like he is, the ſame Man, in reſpect of theſe lovely qualifications or indowments, even when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whileſt, he executes ſuch a Judiciary Act of ſeverity, which he was before; yea and may ſtill love the Perſons of theſe Men, whom he hath condemned to die, conſidered as Men, as much as he did before their delinquency. In like manner, in caſe God ſhall deſtroy with eternall death ſuch Men or Women, whom he ſometimes truly loved and reſpected deerly, this doth not neceſſarily argue the leaſt change or alteration in any attribute of his whatſoever, as either Love, Goodneſſe, Mercy, &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> in caſe theſe Perſons, having been formerly faithfull and obedient unto him, have ſince apoſtatized, and died impenitently. Nay if God ſhould not deſtroy ſuch perſons in ſuch caſes, or upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, it would argue a manifeſt change in ſome of his Attributes, as Severity, hatred of ſin, truth, &amp;c. yea (haply) if the matter be narrowly conſidered, even in his Love, or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelf. For if we judge it any part or property of the Love, or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of God towards goodneſs, and good Men, to put ſo great and gracious a difference between them, and between wickedneſs and wicked Men, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the former with eternall glory, the latter, with eternall ſhame, and miſery, and that he hath at any time expreſsed his love and goodneſs in this kinde; evident it is, that in caſe he ſhould at any time not puniſh perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apoſtates (which are the wickedeſt of Men) with eternall Death, it would argue an alteration or change in thoſe Attributes of his we ſpeak of.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94900:122"/> Therefore to reaſon thus: if God ſhould love a Man to day, and hate him to morrow, it would argue a ſtrange inconſtancy or mutability in God, or in His Love, is a very inconſiderate and weak reaſoning. For the conſtancy or unchangeableneſſe of the Love of God, doth not ſtand in His conſtant loving the ſame Perſon, or Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <hi>materially</hi> conſidered, but only as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered <hi>formally, i. e.</hi> as rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the ſame morally, or in lovelineſſe, which it was, when he firſt loved it. <hi>Julian</hi> the Profeſſor, and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, are the ſame Perſon, or Object, materially conſidered; but in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall conſideration they are two, and theſe very different. In like manner the Angells, in the integrity of their Creation, and in the guilt of their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, are one and the ſame Object, materially conſidered; but formally they differ as much as light and darkneſſe. And to argue, that unleſſe <hi>God</hi> ſhould alwayes love the ſame Perſons, materially conſidered, whom He once, or at any time, loved, he ſhould be mutable in his love, neceſſarily ſuppoſeth, either that <hi>God</hi> hated the lapſed Angells, whileſt they were yet Holy, and in the glory and beauty of their Creation, or elſe that he now loves them in their apoſtacy. The truth is, that ſhould <hi>God</hi> alwayes love the ſame Perſon, or Perſons, though morally diſtinguiſhed from themſelves, and of righteous become wicked and abominable, this would cleerly argue a mutability in his affection, as it would in the affection of ſuch a Man, who ſhould love good Men as good Men, or good Men only, to day, and wicked Men to morrow. So that Men, who were ſometimes loved by <hi>God,</hi> may now be hated of Him, without any the leaſt change or alteration in Him, or in His affection, only by means of a change and alteration in themſelves. The third and laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, wherein the unchangeableneſs of <hi>God,</hi> is to be conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are His Decrees. Theſe, truly ſtated and underſtood, are all abſolute and unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſhall, and will take place and be fulfilled, againſt all contradictions, and oppoſitions whatſoever. But of this formerly <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap 3. Sect.</hi> 18. 20, &amp;c.</note>. And that unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs aſſumed by <hi>God</hi> Himſelf unto Himſelf, in the words in hand, <hi>I am the Lord: I change not,</hi> is (I conceive) that which is found in him in reſpect of His Decrees. The reaſon is, becauſe it is aſſigned by him as the reaſon, why they were not utterly deſtroyed. <hi>I am the Lord: I change not: therefore yee Sons of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi> In the beginning of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> he had declared unto him his Purpoſe and Decree of ſending His only begotten Son, whom he there calls <hi>the Meſſenger of the Covenant,</hi> unto them. He predicteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (<hi>Verſe</hi> 3. 4.) the happy fruits or conſequences of that his ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Reference to their Nation and Poſterity. To the unchangeableneſs of this His Decree, He aſſigns that patience, which he had for a long time exerciſed towards them, under their great and continued Provocations: whereby he implies, that if he could have been turned out of the way of His Decree concerning the ſending of His Son unto them in their Poſterity, they would have done it by the greatneſs of their Sins. But in as much as this His Decree (or Himſelf, in this His Decree) was unchangeable, and yet muſt have been changed, in caſe they had been all deſtroyed (for the Decree was for the ſending him to their Nation and Poſterity) hence (ſaith he) it comes to paſſe, that though your ſins otherwiſe abundantly have deſerved it, yet I have ſpared you from a totall ruine. Therefore in theſe two Scriptures laſt argued, there is every whit as much, or rather more, againſt, then for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the common Doctrine of Perſeverance.</p>
            <p>Another parcell of Scripture ſought out for the ſervice of this Doctrine,<note place="margin">§. 42.</note> is that which riſeth in theſe words. <hi>And we know that all things work together
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94900:123"/> for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the Image of His Son, that He might be the firſt borne amongſt many Brethren. Moreover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom He did predeſtinate, them He alſo called, and whom He called, them He alſo juſtified: and whom He juſtified, them He alſo glorified</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28, 29, 30.</note>. From this Contexture of Scripture it is frequently argued to this effect, that when Men once <hi>love God,</hi> and are effectually called, <hi>i. e.</hi> are Regenerate and doe Believe, they are faſtened to one end (as it were) of a certaine Chaine, conſiſting of ſeverall Decrees of <hi>God</hi> like ſo many Links, indiſſolveably faſtened one unto another, and hereby are infallibly and irreſiſtibly drawn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>glory;</hi> and conſequently, cannot fall away, or periſh finally. To all this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in as much as this paſſage of Scripture, is impreſſed alſo for the ſervice of the Doctrine of abſolute Perſonall Election, we ſhall reſerve the further conſideration of it, till our Method hath carried us on to that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and for the preſent examine it only in relation to the Point in hand. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas it is argued from this place, that perſons once Regenerate are infallibly drawn, and carried on to <hi>glory</hi> by a Series or Chaine of Divine acts or Decrees, un-interruptedly ſuceeding, or taking hold of, one another, I anſwer,</p>
            <p>That no ſuch concluſion as this can reaſonably be drawn out of theſe words. For the Scope of the Apoſtle in the ſequell of this paſſage is cleerly this (as that ratiocinative Particle, <hi>for,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Verſe</hi> 29. plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth) to prove and make good that aſſertion of his, <hi>Verſe 28. viz. That all things worke together for good to thoſe that love God.</hi> To prove this, he ſhews, by what Method, ſteps, and (as it were) degrees of diſpenſation, or tranſaction, <hi>God</hi> will bring it ſo paſs. <hi>Whom He fore-knows</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>i. e.</hi> pre-approves (the word, <hi>knowledge,</hi> frequently in Scripture importing, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation) as he muſt needs doe thoſe <hi>that love him,</hi> theſe he <hi>Predeſtinates to be conformed to the Image of His Son:</hi> and therefore, as <hi>all things,</hi> even his deepeſt ſufferings, <hi>wrought together for good,</hi> unto him, ſo muſt they needs doe unto thoſe, who are <hi>Predeſtinated,</hi> or pre-ordinated by <hi>God,</hi> to a <hi>conformity</hi> with him. To give you yet (ſaith our Apoſtle) a further and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account, how <hi>God</hi> in the ſecret of his Counſells hath belayed things, in order to the bringing of thoſe unto an actuall <hi>conformity with the Image of His Son, (viz.</hi> in <hi>glory,</hi> as appeares <hi>Verſe</hi> 30.) whom He hath <hi>Predeſtinated</hi> thereunto (who are ſuch as <hi>love Him,</hi> and thereupon are approved by him) you are to underſtand, that <hi>whom He hath</hi> ſo <hi>Predeſtinated, He hath alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, [i. e.</hi> hath Purpoſed, or Decreed to <hi>call</hi>

               </gap>t to be underſtood in ſuch expreſſions, are plainly enough men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>Scripture</hi> elſe-where; whereas no ſuch conditions, as I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon the Decrees of God, ſo poſitively and peremptorily expreſſed (as we have heard) in the <hi>Scripture</hi> in hand, can be proved from any other <hi>Scripture,</hi> to relate or appertaine unto them; to this alſo I anſwer; 1. That by the tenor of this objection it is granted, that the peremptorineſs and abſoluteneſs of the ſaid Decrees cannot be inferred from the <hi>Scripture</hi> now under debate, but that recourſe muſt be had to other places for the proof hereof. Therefore no perſeverance of <hi>Saints</hi> concludable from this <hi>Scripture.</hi> 2. For other <hi>Scriptures,</hi> we have already in part, and ſhall (<hi>God</hi> ſo pleaſing) further ſhew in due time, that none of thoſe, which are <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pillars</hi> of ſuch a Doctrine, have any communion at all with it. Nay, 3. (And laſtly) we ſhall (I doubt not) be able to ſhew, that there are other <hi>Scriptures,</hi> from which the conditions ſpecified as relating to the ſaid Decrees, may be undeniably evinced to relate unto them accordingly. In the meane time, that the Decrees, or purpoſed acts of <hi>God</hi> expreſſed in the <hi>Scripture</hi> in hand, as <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>justifying</hi> thoſe that are <hi>called,</hi> and ſo his <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing</hi> thoſe that are <hi>juſtified,</hi> have no ſuch peremptory or eſſentiall connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between them, but that the former, in reference to particular perſons, may be put in execution, and take place, without the latter, I demonſtrate.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94900:124"/> 2. By this reaſon. If the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhould frame this ſeries or chaine of Divine Acts, with an intent to ſhew or teach the uninterruptibleneſſe of it in what caſe, or caſes, ſoever, he ſhould fight againſt his generall and maine ſcope, or deſigne, in that part of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> which lieth from about <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. to the end; which cleerly is this; to exhort, ſtrengthen, and incourage them, to conſtancy and Perſeverance in ſuffering afflictions. For to ſuggeſt any ſuch thing unto them, as that being <hi>called and justified,</hi> nothing could poſſibly interpoſe to hinder them from being <hi>glorified,</hi> was to furniſh them with a plaine motive, or ground, on which to neglect his exhortation in that kinde. For who will be perſwaded to ſuffer tribulation, or things grievous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, for the obtaining of that, which they have ſufficient aſſurance given that they ſhall obtaine, whether they ſuffer ſuch things, or no? Therefore certainly the Apoſtle did not intend here to teach, or imply, the certainty of Perſeverance in thoſe, which are once <hi>juſtified,</hi> unto Salvation, againſt all carriages, and miſcarriages, of theſe Perſons whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) I demonſtrate the ſame thing yet further, by this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. If God ſhould <hi>justifie</hi> all without exception, whom He <hi>calleth,</hi> and that againſt all bars of wickedneſs and unbelief, poſſible to be laid in His way by thoſe, who are <hi>called,</hi> then might ungodly and unbelieving Perſons inherit the Kingdome of God, and of <hi>Christ,</hi> But the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpeaks aloud the impoſſibility, or (how-ever) the non-futurity, hereof. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The reaſon of the connexion in the Major Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſition, is evident; it being a known truth, that Perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> juſtified are in a condition, or preſent capacity, of inheriting the Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that the ſaid Connexion is tardy in this, that it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth<note place="margin">§. 45.</note> that, which ought not to be ſuppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that perſons <hi>called</hi> by God (in the ſence of the word, <hi>calling,</hi> here meant) may lay ſuch barrs of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or unbelief in the way, which ſhall hinder God from <hi>justifying</hi> them; I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Judas, Demas, Simon Magus</hi> and others, were <hi>called,</hi> and yet they laid ſuch barrs as we ſpeak of, in the way, and by which their <hi>Juſtification</hi> (at leaſt their finall <hi>justification</hi>) was obſtructed and prevented. If it be replied, but theſe were not <hi>called</hi> by God, in the ſence of the Apoſtles, <hi>called,</hi> in the place under queſtion; I anſwer; 1. It hath not yet been proved by any Man, nor (I believe) ever will be, that the <hi>calling</hi> here ſpoken of imports any ſuch act, or work, of <hi>God,</hi> whereby the <hi>called</hi> are irreſiſtibly neceſſitated ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly to believe <note n="a" place="margin">

               </note>. If it imports no ſuch thing as this, what hinders, but that the perſons mentioned, might have been <hi>called,</hi> with, or by that very kinde of <hi>calling,</hi> which is here ſpoken of? 2. Suppoſe it ſhould be granted that the <hi>calling</hi> here ſpoken of, is that kinde of <hi>calling,</hi> which is alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſaving anſwer of Faith, yet neither doth this prove, but that even ſuch <hi>called</hi> ones may obſtruct and prevent, by wickedneſſe and unbelief, their finall <hi>juſtification,</hi> and conſequently their <hi>glorification.</hi> If ſo, then the chaine of Divine Acts or Decrees, here framed by the Apoſtle, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolveable in any ſuch ſence, which imports an infallible and univerſall exertion or execution of the latter, whereſoever the former hath taken place. That <hi>Judas</hi> was <hi>called</hi> with ſuch a <hi>calling</hi> as this, is <hi>Chryſostomes</hi> collection from, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. from whom <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> knows not well how to diſſent in the point <note n="b" place="margin">Vid.

But that they all three with Wickedneſſe and Unbeliefe barred up the way againſt their finall <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:94900:125"/> is (I ſuppoſe) every Mans Hypotheſis and grant, or conjecture (at leaſt.)</p>
            <p>But ſome (it may be) will yet further object againſt the interpretation<note place="margin">§. 46.</note> given, and plead, 1. That the Connexion between theſe two links of this chaine, <hi>predestination to a conformity with Chrst, and calling,</hi> is ſimply and abſolutely indiſſolveable, ſo that (for example) whoſoever is thus <hi>predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> by God, never failes of being <hi>called</hi> by him. 2. That it is altogether unlikely, that in one and the ſame ſeries, or concatenation, of Divine Actions, there ſhould not be the ſame fixedneſs, or certainty of coherence between all the Particulars, ſo that (for example) there ſhould be as much certainty that he that is <hi>called,</hi> ſhall be <hi>juſtified;</hi> and againe that he that is <hi>juſtified,</hi> ſhall be <hi>glorified,</hi> as there is, that he that is <hi>predeſtinated,</hi> ſhall be <hi>called.</hi> To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a demurrer upon the former of theſe Pleas, which was, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the <hi>Predeſtination</hi> of God mentioned, and his <hi>calling,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruptible by any interveniency whatſoever. Somewhat doubtfull to me it is, whether a Perſon, who by means of <hi>the Love of God,</hi> which is in him at preſent, falls under his Decree of <hi>Predestination,</hi> and conſequently by vertue of this Decree, is <hi>Predestinated to be conformed to the Image of Chriſt,</hi> may not poſſibly before the time appointed by God for his <hi>calling,</hi> be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that his affection, and conſequently paſſe from under that Decree of <hi>Predestination,</hi> and fall under another Decree of God oppoſite thereunto, and ſo never come to be <hi>called.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the latter of the ſaid Pleas, I anſwer, by denying the unlikelyhood therein aſſerted. For in one and the ſame concatenation of Divine acts, the aſpect, and manner, or kinde of dependance, between act and act, may vary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different natures, or the different tenor of Gods Decrees concerning them. As for example. God may Decree to Create, or give Being unto a Man: againe, He may Decree, to give unto this Man a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Means and Power, whereby to maintaine himſelf in this Being given unto him: Againe yet further, he may Decree to give unto this Man, not only a ſufficiency of Means and Power, to make good his Poſſeſſion of that Being thus given him, but further, to improve his preſent Being firſt given unto him, into a better, and more deſirable Being. Fourthly, he may yet further Decree to promote and advance the condition of this his Creature, Man, above the line of his firſt Being. In this ſubordinate concatenation of Divine Acts, all Decreed by him, there is not the ſame aſpect or relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (I mean in Point of neceſſity, and contingency) between every former act, and that which followeth. As for inſtance: the ſecond act of the foure now mentioned, may, partly by reaſon of the tenor of the Decree, by which it was Decreed by God, partly by reaſon of the nature of it, (I meane in reference to ſome Divine Projection, or end) have an abſolute and un-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptible dependance upon, or connexion with, the firſt: ſo that in caſe God creates a Man, he is abſolutely and againſt all interveniences whatſoever reſolved to confer upon him, that ſufficiency of Power which was mentioned. Neither Man himſelfe, Angell, or Devill, could prevent or hinder God from conferring ſuch an endowment upon Man, being created by him. But it doth not follow from hence, that there muſt needs be the like aſpect of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, between this ſecond act, and the third; or between the third, and the fourth. For though God as well Decreed the third act, as the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> to beſtow upon his Creature, Man, a ſufficiency of Power and Means
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94900:125"/> whereby to improve his firſt Being into a better, yet he did not Decree it, <hi>i. e.</hi> the doing of it, ſimply and abſolutely, but only proviſionally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſuppoſall of ſuch an interveniency, one or more, which very poſſibly might not have interveened, as <hi>viz.</hi> either the fall of this Creature, Man, by ſin, and the gift of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> upon it to die for his Redemption; or elſe the continuance of Man for a time in the honour of his Creation, and intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his obedience unto God. Firſt, that the fall of Man was contingent, there being no cauſe either within him, or without him, neceſſitating him hereunto, is unqueſtionable; (that the fore-knowledge of it by God, did no wayes prejudice or hinder the contingency of it, hath been formerly ſhewed,) 2. That the gift of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to die for the Redemption of Man, depended in this ſence upon his fall, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo as that he ſhould not have been given in ſuch a way, or upon ſuch terms, (I meane to die) had not Man fallen, is (I ſuppoſe) the ſence and apprehenſion of every Man. 3. And laſtly, that that Act of God in giving unto Man, Power, Means, and Opportunity, to better Himſelf in Point of condition, above the line of his Creation, or firſt Being, depends (his fall ſuppoſed, which was contingent alſo, as was lately ſaid) upon the gift of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo as never to have taken place, in caſe He had not been ſo given, is ſufficiently evident without Proof. So that evident it is, that this Act of God, hath only an accidentall or contingent depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon, or coherence with, the former; whereas this former hath an eſſentiall and neceſſary connexion with the firſt, as hath been ſhewed. There is the ſame conſideration of the relation between the third, and fourth (or laſt) of theſe Acts. For God, upon His Decree to grant unto His Creature, Man, a ſufficiency of means and opportunity, to Promote (in his way, <hi>viz.</hi> by higher ſervices, and greater acts of obedience) his happineſſe above the condition of his Creation or firſt being, might, and did, Decree alſo, Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to promote (in his way, <hi>viz.</hi> by the ingagement of His Power,) his Creatures happineſſe accordingly. But this latter act of His though De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by Him, doth not import an abſolute neceſſity of Performance by Him, but only a conditionall and contingent, the tenor of that Decree of His, wherein this act is Decreed, being this; in caſe My Creature, Man, ſhall quit himſelf in any meaſure worthy that grace, which I ſhall give unto him, in and through My Son <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I will make Him greater in happineſs, then He was in the ſtate of His Creation. So that it is as cleer as the light at Noon-day, that in one and the ſame ſeries or ſubordination of Divine acts, there may be a different habitude in point of dependence between act and act, ſo that one of theſe acts may infallibly, neceſſarily, and univerſally follow and be exerted upon another, Precedent to it in the ſubordination; and yet another of theſe act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, follow the next Predeceſſor to it in the ſeries, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently, and conſequently admit of many ſuſpenſions and interruptions. Therefore there is nothing in the laſt Objection againſt that expoſition of the <hi>Scripture</hi> in hand, which hath been aſſerted, both the feet upon which it ſtands, being weak and lame.</p>
            <p>There is yet another Objection, colourable (I ſuppoſe) in ſome Mens<note place="margin">§. 47.</note> eyes, againſt the ſaid interpretation. The ſubſtance of it, this. If the links of that chaine of Divine acts deſcribed in this paſſage of <hi>Scripture,</hi> may be ſevered, or broken, by the miſcarriages, or unworthineſſe, of the <hi>Saints</hi> in any kinde, then had the Apoſtle no ſufficient reaſon to build the <hi>Saints</hi> ſo high upon it, in Confidence, Exultations, and Triumphs, as He doth in the Verſes immediately following. <hi>What ſhall we ſay to theſe things? If God
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94900:126"/> be on our ſide, who can be againſt us?</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Saints</hi> are children of many infirmities, and of much unworthineſſe: apt to ſin againſt God every moment. Therefore if their Peace, and Salvation depend upon their own regular and worthy walkings with <hi>God,</hi> they are in a condition of no good ſecurity to be ſaved: and what ground then have they to rejoyce and triumph at any ſuch rate, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſeemes here to invite and incourage them unto? To this I anſwer, that the Heart of this Objection was broken in the laſt preceding <hi>Chapter,</hi> where we ſhewed, upon ſeverall conſiderations and grounds, that the <hi>Saints</hi> have cauſe in abundance to rejoyce, yea and to triumph, under the hope and expectation of Salvation, notwithſtanding any poſſibility they are ſubject unto of declining, or periſhing. The Reader (I preſume) will be ſatisfied in this Point, upon a ſerious peruſall of what is there Written, from <hi>Section</hi> 21. to the end of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> I here add,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the friends and favourers themſelves of the common interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">§. 48.</note> of the place in hand, and which contradicteth the expoſition given, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally grant, and teach, that the <hi>Saints</hi> themſelves cannot have any Peace or Comfort in their Faith, or aſſurance of Salvation, whileſt they walk pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely, looſely, or unfaithfully with God. So that theſe Men themſelves doe ſuſpend the Peace and Comfort, (and much more, the Joy and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph) of the Faith of the <hi>Saints</hi> upon their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> behaviour, and Regular walkings with God. Therefore <hi>judging</hi> the Expoſition given, upon ſuch an account as this, they <hi>condemne</hi> themſelves, and their owne Doctrines.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The aſſureance of the continuance of Gods Love to them, and of His care over them, whileſt they in any meaſure walke worthy of it, is a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and due foundation unto the <hi>Saints</hi> of every whit as great a confidence, Exultation and Triumph, as the Apoſtle, in the words mentioned intitles them unto. Yea,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The very particular and expreſſe ground, upon which He buildeth up Himſelf and the <hi>Saints</hi> with Him, in ſuch a Triumphant Confidence, as we heard, is this; the ſence or aſſureance of Gods Love towards them [mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whileſt they walk with Him, as becommeth <hi>Saints;</hi> becauſe being out of this poſture, they can neither have ſence, nor aſſureance of His Love, as our adverſaries themſelves acknowledge and teach, as we lately heard] not any aſſureance of the continuance of His Love to them, how profane, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or abominable ſoever they can, or ſhall, be. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then to theſe things? if God</hi> BE <hi>with us, who can be againſt us?</hi> Therefore,</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) ſuch a ſuppoſition or Doctrine as this, that they that are at preſent <hi>juſtified,</hi> may poſſibly ſin themſelves out of the Grace of <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and ſo never come to be <hi>glorified,</hi> is upon due conſideration, no bridle at all to check the holy and humble confidence, or boaſtings of the <hi>Saints</hi> in God, or in the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> they may in the face and preſence of ſuch a Doctrine, though acknowledged and admitted for truth, lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the wings of a bleſſed ſecurity unto Heaven, and rejoyce that joy, which is unſpeakeable and glorious. But of theſe things we ſpake liberally in the laſt <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some may yet poſſibly imagine, that they diſcover a ground of confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">§. 49.</note> of all that hath been ſaid upon the Context of <hi>Scripture</hi> yet in hand, <hi>Verſe</hi> 29. in thoſe words; <hi>That he might be the firſt-borne amongst many Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> For from hence they may reaſon thus. If this be Gods End or
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94900:126"/> Deſigne in <hi>Predestinating</hi> thoſe, <hi>whom he knew before</hi> [or, pre-approved] <hi>to be conformed to the Image of His Son</hi> [in glory] <hi>that He might be the firſt borne amongſt many Brethren, [i. e.</hi> might have the honour of bringing many into part and fellowſhip with Himſelf in His own bleſſedneſſe and glory] then muſt all they, who are thus <hi>Predeſtinated,</hi> of neceſſity attaine, or come to injoy ſuch a <hi>conformity</hi> with Him; otherwiſe God ſhall be fruſtrated in His Deſigne, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be defeated and diſappointed of that excellent honour, which His Father projected for Him. For if one, or ſome, thus <hi>predeſtinated,</hi> may miſcarry, and never come to enjoy an actuall <hi>conformity</hi> unto Him in His glory, why may not others of them miſcarry likewiſe, and conſequently, all: and ſo the Great Counſell or Project of God for the honor of His Son <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> be laid in the duſt. To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Suppoſe that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould have no <hi>Brethren conformable</hi> unto Him in glory, yet would it not follow from hence, that the Counſell or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of God to make Him <hi>the firſt borne among many Brethren,</hi> ſhould be made void, or miſcarry. For the Counſell or Deſigne of God in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, ſtood Mainely and Principally in this; <hi>viz.</hi> in caſting this honour upon <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> that He ſhould be a Perſon every wayes fitted and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould act, and doe, or be ready and willing to act, and do, every ſuch thing, whereby many of his <hi>Brethren, [i. e.</hi> of the children of Men] if they were not moſt ſhamefully and groſſely neglective of themſelves, and their own greateſt concernments, might come to partake with him in His great Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and glory. And in caſe Men ſhould prove thus neglective of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo as voluntarily to deprive themſelves of that great Salvation, which <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> out of His great Love, and with the ſore <hi>travell of his Soul,</hi> hath prepared and made ready for them, yea and invited, and called, yea and preſſed upon them, to accept at his hand, yet the honour and glory of a ſignall Benefactor and great Saviour, ſhall remaine intire unto Him; nor is there the leaſt colour or pretence, why He ſhould ſuffer the leaſt diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or prejudice in the thoughts, either of Men, or Angells, becauſe of the wilfull folly and madneſſe of Men to forſake their own mercies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy themſelves. Himſelf owned, and built upon, this conſideration, when He ſpake thus by the mouth of one of His greateſt Prophets: <hi>Though Iſrael be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eſa. 49 5.</note>. In the former Verſe, He ſpeaks thus in his Repreſentor: <hi>Then I ſaid, I have laboured in vaine, I have ſpent my Strength for nought, and in vaine: yet ſurely my judgement is with the Lord; and my worke with my God.</hi> And immediately before the ſaid words, thus: <hi>And now ſaith the Lord that formed me from the Womb to be his ſervant,</hi> TO BRING JACOB AGAIN TO HIM, <hi>Though Iſrael be not gathered, yet, &amp;c.</hi> Cleerly implying, that though Gods Intent and Counſell was to <hi>forme Chriſt from the Womb</hi> for this end and purpoſe, <hi>viz. to bring Jacob againe to him</hi> [and ſo to ſave, and make Him bleſſed] yet would it be no diſparagement unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor any miſcarriage or defeature of the Counſell of God herein, though <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhould not upon this account, be <hi>brought againe</hi> to him, or be made bleſſed by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe when it is ſaid, that God <hi>formed Chriſt from the Womb to bring Iacob againe to him,</hi> the meaning is not, that He <hi>formed</hi> Him with any ſuch intent, out of any ſuch end or deſigne, to <hi>bring Iacob</hi> again <hi>to Him</hi> by head and ſhoulders (as we uſe to ſay) or by a ſtrong and irreſiſtible hand; but <hi>to bring Jacob againe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> that he might be repreſented, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> as ſuch a Perſon, who had attoned their ſins, made their
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94900:127"/> Peace with God by His Blood, and had purchaſed grace and favour and every good thing for them at his hand, in caſe they would repent and turne againe to him: and further, that he might by his Spirit, eſpecially in the Miniſtry of his Prophets, adminiſter unto them inward ſtrength, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent excitements, abundantly ſufficient to have brought them to a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and imbracement of theſe great things of their Peace. In this ſence (and in no other) <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>formed by God from the Womb, to bring Iacob againe to him:</hi> and thus it appears alſo, how, and in what reſpect <hi>God</hi> was not diſappointed of his end, purpoſe, or intention in his <hi>forming of Chriſt,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf any wayes diſparaged, notwithſtanding <hi>Iacob</hi> was not actually converted, or <hi>brought againe</hi> to him. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon the ſame conſideration, ſaith of Himſelf and other the Apoſtles and faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpell, thus: <hi>For we are unto God a ſweet Savour of Chriſt in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 15</note>. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeares, that howſoever Gods reall Intent and Deſigne in ſending <hi>Chriſt,</hi> into the World, was (according to the frequent teſtimony of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>) the Salvation, and not the periſhing or condemnation, of Men, yet he was no more defeated or diſappointed of his deſigne herein, by the periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then by the Salvation, of Men. Otherwiſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpell, would not be a <hi>ſweet Savour [i. e.</hi> matter of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and ſatisfaction] unto him, as well in thoſe <hi>who periſh,</hi> through unbelief, as in thoſe <hi>who are ſaved</hi> by believing. For who can be pleaſed, or much ſatisfied, with, or under, diſappointments? Therefore Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of ſaving the World by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> is not ſo to be conceived or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if he intended to <hi>ſave</hi> Men by him, upon any terms, or under any conſideration whatſoever, or without all Proviſo's, Limitations, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; but thus, he intended to ſave the World by him, <hi>i. e.</hi> to put the World into a capacity of Salvation, and to afford unto the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Men, means and opportunities in abundance, whereby to repent, and believe, and conſequently to be ſaved. So that whenſoever <hi>Chriſt</hi> is faithfully and effectually Preached unto Men, in order to their <hi>Salvation,</hi> God obtaines his end and intent concerning their Salvation, whether they come to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> or no, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether they repent and believe, or remaine impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent in unbelief.</p>

               <hi>amongſt many Brethren,</hi> I deſire to give notice once for all (for there may be frequent uſe of the obſervation, in theſe controverſies) that it is frequent in <hi>Scripture</hi> to expreſſe a thing after the manner of an event, or conſequent that will, or ſhall, come to paſſe, or follow upon ſuch or ſuch an occaſion, or means, ſomewayes likely to produce it, which yet frequently comes not to paſſe, but only is intended or deſired; nay the contrary whereof many times follows and comes to paſſe, in ſtead thereof. According to this Dialect of Speech, <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſſeth himſelf unto the People, thus: <hi>and the Man that will doe preſumptuouſly, and not hearken unto the Prieſt,—or unto the Iudge, even that Man ſhall die: and thou ſhalt put away the evill from Iſrael: and all</hi> [or, that all] <hi>the People ſhall heare,</hi> [or may hear] <hi>and feare, and doe no more preſumptuouſly</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 17. 12, 13.</note>. This <hi>hearing, fearing,</hi> and reſtraining of the <hi>People from doing preſumptuouſly,</hi> are mentioned, if we reſpect the preciſe forme of the words, as if they were ſuch events, which would alwayes follow and come to paſſe, upon the occaſion or means ſpecified, <hi>viz.</hi> the inflicting of death upon the Delinquent ſpoken of. Yet <hi>Moſes</hi> his intent was not to affirme
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94900:127"/> this, which had been an untruth to affirme (ſuch events as theſe many times failing, if at any time obtained) but to ſhew what God His intent was in commanding ſuch ſevere executions to be done in ſuch caſes, or rather (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) to ſhew, what fruits might reaſonably be expected from ſuch juſt ſeverity. So again in the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> (ſpeaking of the King, whom they ſhould ſet over them, and the Book of the Law,) <hi>And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall reade therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learne to feare the Lord His God, to keep all the words of this Law and theſe Statutes, to doe them</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 17. 19.</note>. Theſe words, <hi>that he may learne,</hi> &amp;c. doe not import the event, or effect, that would certainly follow upon the duty or courſe preſcribed; but either what Gods Intentions were in Preſcribing ſuch a courſe, or what ſuch a courſe was proper and likely to effect. Many other places there are of like character and import: amongſt which that in Preſent debate is to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. God <hi>Predeſtinate,</hi> theſe and theſe, or rather, ſuch and ſuch, <hi>to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Image of His Son, that He might be the firſt borne,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe words, <hi>that He might be the first borne,</hi> &amp;c. doe not neceſſarily import any event, or effect, which ſhould certainly come to paſſe, or be produced, by that Act of Gods <hi>Predeſtination;</hi> but only ſuch an event, as was intended by God (in ſuch a ſence as intentions are appropriable unto him) in that Act of His, or which would probably follow thereupon.</p>
            <p>It may yet further be demanded (by way of Objection againſt any Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation<note place="margin">§. 51.</note> whatſoever of the Paſſage in hand, which makes the golden chaine of Divine acts therein, diſſolveable in any link or part of it, in what caſe, or caſes, ſoever) If either they who are <hi>Predeſtinated,</hi> may not <hi>be called;</hi> or they that are <hi>called,</hi> may not be <hi>juſtified,</hi> or they that are <hi>juſtified,</hi> not be <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> how can the Apoſtles Proof ſtand, that <hi>all things worke together for good to thoſe, who love God,</hi> which (as your ſelf acknowledged) is the Doctrine or Concluſion, the demonſtration of the truth whereof the Apoſtle intends by the Producing of this golden chaine of Divine acts, taking hold, in a clear ſubordination, one upon another? Can <hi>all things</hi> be ſaid to <hi>work together for good</hi> to him, who never comes to be <hi>glorified,</hi> but to be everlaſtingly condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>That this Doctrine or ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>All things work together for good unto thoſe who love God,</hi> is to be underſtood with the like Explication, or graine of ſpirituall ſalt, wherewith theſe two (and a thouſand more) ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are to be ſeaſoned; <hi>He that believeth, and is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſhall be ſaved: but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mar. 16. 16</note>. The meaning of this latter ſaying (to proceede a <hi>notioribus ad magis ignota) He that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> is not this: He that now, or at Preſent, <hi>believeth not,</hi> let him doe all he will, or can, let him believe a thouſand times over hereafter, ſhall notwithſtanding be <hi>damned;</hi> this (I ſay) is not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours meaning in that clauſe. His meaning is cleerly enough this: <hi>He that believeth not, [viz.</hi> and continueth an unbeliever to his dying day] <hi>ſhall be damned.</hi> But it doth not follow from hence, that he that is a preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, muſt of neceſſity live and die in unbelief, and ſo be <hi>damned.</hi> So that there is a ſence, wherein it is as true that he that believeth not may and ſhall be ſaved; <hi>viz.</hi> if he repents of his unbelief, and <hi>returnes to his vomit</hi> no more. So (to ſearch now into the former ſaying) when our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that believeth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> his meaning is not, that he who at preſent <hi>believeth,</hi> and hath been, or ſhall be <hi>Baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> let him do what he will, or can, let him turne Apoſtate, make ſhipwrack of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94900:128"/> his Faith, renounce his Baptiſme, and the like; but, <hi>he that believeth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved, i. e. He that believeth,</hi> and continueth a Believer, or ſhall be found a <hi>Believer,</hi> and a Man ſtanding faſt by his Baptiſme, and<note place="margin">Review the 43 Sect. of this Chapter.</note> holding out his Profeſſion with conſtancy, unto the end, <hi>ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Our Saviours cleer intent in theſe ſayings, was to ſhew and aſſert, in the former, the bleſſed intereſt of Faith in conjunction with a Chriſtian Profeſſion, as <hi>viz.</hi> that it gives unto Men a title and rightfulneſſe of claime to Salvation; in the latter, the dreadfull danger, and formidable Property of unbelief, as <hi>viz.</hi> that it expoſeth the Perſon, in whom it abides, to the vengeance of Hell fire. But as it was no part of his intent, to aſſert any inſeparableneſſe of unbelief, from the ſubject thereof, in the latter clauſe: ſo neither did he any wayes intend to aſſert any ſuch property unto Faith, in the former. In like manner when the Apoſtle layeth down this Doctrine, <hi>All things work together for good unto thoſe that love God,</hi> his meaning is not, either to aſſert the unquenchableneſs, or unremoveableneſs of this affection from its preſent ſubject, or to imply, that whoſoever is at preſent a lover, of <hi>God,</hi> is in any ſuch Poſſeſſion of that Priviledge he ſpeaks of, (I meane, of having <hi>all things to worke together for good unto him</hi>) that, in caſe his love to <hi>God</hi> languiſheth and dieth, and a contrary affection ſucceeds in the place thereof, he can, or ſhall, never be caſt out of it. But his intire and cleer intent in that Poſition or ſaying of his, is to ſhew, that the <hi>love of God,</hi> in what Subject or Perſon ſoever it reſides, and whileſt it there reſides, doth, by vertue of the gracious Decree or Will of <hi>God</hi> in that behalfe, inveſt him with this Priviledge; <hi>viz.</hi> to have all occurrences of things relating to him, even afflictions and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions themſelves, benefactors unto him. To make this good, he ſhews, what <hi>God</hi> hath fully Purpoſed or Decreed to doe for ſuch Men, or (which is the ſame) what he hath <hi>Predestinated,</hi> ſuch men unto, as <hi>viz.</hi> to a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> with, or to the <hi>Image</hi> of His own Son, the Lord <hi>Chriſt, i. e.</hi> to make them glorious and bleſſed in ſuch a way, or upon ſuch terms, as <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was the greateſt <hi>lover of God</hi> that ever was, is now become glorious; unto whoſe glorification all things that happened unto him in this preſent World, and more eſpecially his ſufferings, joyntly contributed and <hi>wrought.</hi> And for further ſatisfaction, how, by what means, and degrees, God actually brings theſe Perſons, [<hi>viz.</hi> continuing ſtill <hi>lovers</hi> of him] to this <hi>conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> with Chriſt in His glory, He adds: <hi>Moreover, whom he did</hi> [thus] <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate, them He alſo called, [i. e.</hi> as was formerly interpreted <note n="a" place="margin">Sect. 42. of this Chapter.</note>, He Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>call, viz.</hi> to the knowledge of His Son, as the Saviour of the world, and <hi>calleth</hi> them accordingly: in which reſpect they are ſaid to be Perſons <hi>called according to his Purpoſe,</hi> Verſe 28.] <hi>and whom He called, them He alſo juſtified [i. e.</hi> Purpoſed <hi>to juſtifie,</hi> and <hi>juſtifieth</hi> accordingly,] <hi>and whom He juſtified, them alſo He glorified: i. e.</hi> Purpoſed to <hi>glorifie</hi> [or, to bring to an actuall <hi>conformity</hi> with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in His glory] and <hi>glorifieth</hi> them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Why the purpoſed or intended actings of God are expreſſed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> rather in the Preter-Perfect tenſe, then either in the preſent, or future, is accounted elſewhere in this Diſcourſe <note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 4.

But in all theſe gradations menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of the Counſell of <hi>God</hi> concerning the bringing of thoſe, <hi>that love him,</hi> unto a <hi>conformity</hi> with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in His <hi>glory,</hi> the ſame ſubject, formally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe that <hi>love him,</hi> as ſuch, is to be underſtood: ſo that in caſe the ſubject be changed, under, or between, any of the ſaid gradations, and he (for example) who <hi>loved God,</hi> being yet only Predeſtinated by <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>conformed unto Chriſt in glory,</hi> and not <hi>called,</hi> or being <hi>called,</hi> and not

The Apoſtles intent in the paſſage in hand, was to declare the ſeries and tenor of Gods Counſells for the glorious benefit and good of thoſe who ſhould love Him, not of thoſe who ſhould ceaſe to love Him, or apoſtatize from their affection towards Him; nor yet to teach, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or inſinuate in the leaſt, the undecayableneſſe, or unquenchableneſſe of this affection in Men. But enough for the clearing of this place.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only Propound and Anſwer one <hi>Scripture</hi> more, upon the account<note place="margin">§. 52.</note> we are now drawing up, which is frequently argued with great importunity for the Doctrine of Perſeverance. The tenor of the place is this. <hi>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may feare me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them. And I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turne away from them to doe them good, but I will put my feare into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ier. 31. 39. 40.</note>. In theſe words (ſay our Antagoniſts in the preſent controverſie) is manifeſtly contained an abſolute Promiſe of Perſeverance made by God unto his Church. To this I anſwer, that it can no wayes be proved, nor is it any wayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the grace of Perſeverance ſhould be here abſolutely Promiſed unto <hi>Saints,</hi> or <hi>Believers.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Evident it is from the whole tenor of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> that the words contain a ſpeciall Promiſe made particularly to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As evident it is, upon the ſame account, that the Promiſe here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was not made only to the <hi>Saints,</hi> or ſound <hi>Believers</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were but few, but to the whole body, or generality of them. Peruſe the latter part of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> from about, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. to the end.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is yet upon the ſame account as evident, as either of the former, that this Promiſe was made unto this Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when, and whileſt they were, or at leaſt, conſidered as now being, in the <hi>iron furnace</hi> of the Babylonian captivity. <hi>Behold, I will gather them out of all Countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my ſury, and in great wrath, and I will bring them again unto this place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 37.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From theſe words (now cited) ſo immediately preceding the Paſſages offered to debate, it cleerly appears, that the Promiſe in theſe Paſſages relates unto, and concerns, their Reduction and returne from, and out of, that captivity, into their own Land. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. It cannot be a Promiſe of abſolute and finall Perſeverance in grace unto the end of their lives reſpectively. For, 1. The Promiſe was made unto the body or generality of this People, even unto all thoſe that God had <hi>driven into all Countries in his anger and fury,</hi> and not only unto the <hi>Saints,</hi> or true <hi>Believers</hi> amongſt them, unleſſe we ſhall ſay, that they were only the holy Perſons amongſt them that were thus <hi>driven</hi> by him. The Promiſe then reſpects as well the unfaithfull, as the true <hi>Believers,</hi> in this Nation: and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94900:129"/> ſo cannot be a Promiſe of Perſeverance in grace unto theſe. 2. The Promiſe here exhibited, was a Promiſe appropriated, and fitted to the preſent State and Condition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were now ſcattered up and down the World, and in a ſad captivity (at leaſt were thus conſidered in this promiſe, as was lately ſaid) in which reſpect it muſt needs be conceived to containe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what peculiar to that their condition. Now the promiſe of perſeverance in grace (according to the Doctrine of our adverſaries) was a ſtanding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe amongſt them, and ſo had been from the firſt, equally reſpecting them, or the elect amongſt them, in every eſtate and condition. 3. The promiſe of perſeverance in grace (according to the ſame principles) includes in it, or ſuppoſeth, ſuch an interpoſure of God by his ſpirit and grace, which ſhall, and will, and muſt needs, infallibly produce the effect of perſeverance, in all thoſe, to whom it is made, <hi>i. e.</hi> true <hi>Believers:</hi> wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as, evident it is from the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that this promiſe notwithſtanding, the <hi>Jewes</hi> might rebell againſt, and apoſtatize from, God. The whole paſſage in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is this. <hi>Therefore ſay, thus ſaith the Lord God, although I have caſt them far off among the Heathen, and although I have ſcattered them among the Countries, yet will I be to them as a little Sanctuary in the Countries where they ſhall come. Therefore ſay, thus ſaith the Lord God, I will even gather you from the People, and Aſſemble you out of the Countries, where yee have been ſcattered, and I will give you the Land of Iſrael. And they ſhall come thither, and they ſhall take away all the deteſtable things thereof, and all the abominations</hi> thereof from thence. <hi>And I will give them one Heart, and I will put a new Spirit within you, and I will take the ſtony Heart out of their Fleſh, and will give them an Heart of Fleſh, That they may walke in my Statutes, and keepe mine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and doe them: and they ſhall be my People, and I will be their God</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ezek. 11. 17. 18. &amp;c.</note>. There is nothing more clear, then that the promiſe contained in theſe words, is for ſubſtance and import the ſame, with that in conſideration from the Prophet <hi>Jeremy.</hi> Yet here it followes: <hi>But as for them, whoſe heart walketh after the heart of their deteſtable things, and their abominations, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence their way upon their own head, ſaith the Lod God</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 21.</note>. Which evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſeth, that notwithſtanding the former promiſe, pretended to be a promiſe (either in whole, or in part) of perſevering in grace, yet they, to whom it is made, may <hi>walk after the Heart of detestable things: [i. e.</hi> ſo practiſe <hi>deteſtable things,</hi> as to promote their intereſt, and cauſe them to be practiſed by others,] and that to their own ruine and deſtruction. For that this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>But as for them, &amp;c.</hi> concernes the ſame perſons, or nation, to whom the precedent promiſes were made, the carriage of the Context makes out of queſtion; and beſides, is the generall ſence of Interpreters upon the place: yea and <hi>Calvin</hi> Himſelf underſtands it of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">

(And laſtly) If abſolute perſeverance ſhould be here promiſed, there is no time, or ſeaſon can be imagined, wherein the promiſe ſhould have been fulfilled by God. If it be ſaid, that it hath alwayes been fulfilled in the Elect and faithfull, I anſwer, 1. That it hath been already proved, that it was made to the maine body and community of the Jewiſh Nation, and not only to the Elect or faithfull amongſt them. And therefore if it ſhould be fulfilled in theſe only, it ſhould be fulfilled, but by half, and (indeed) not to that proportion: and conſequently, if propriety of ſpeech be admitted, not <hi>fulfilled</hi> at all. 2. If this be all the fulfilling of it, it was as much fulfill'd, during, and under the captivity, yea and before it, as at any time afterwards.

            <p n="1">1. That theſe words, <hi>that they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> ſavor too much of the Tranſlation: the Original would rather have them thus, <hi>that they</hi> MAY <hi>not depart from me,</hi> as the Tranſlators alſo themſelves render words of the ſame character in the former Verſe. <hi>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they</hi> MAY <hi>fear me for ever.</hi> And thus both <hi>Arias Montanus</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The words thus read, do not neceſſarily import the actual event or taking place of the effect intended by God in the Promiſe, and his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof, but onely his Intention it ſelf in both theſe, together with the ſufficiency and aptneſs of what he promiſeth, for the producing of ſuch an effect in them. As when our Saviour expreſſed himſelf thus unto the <hi>Jews, But theſe things I ſay, that ye might be ſaved</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">John 5 34</note>; he did not ſuppoſe, that they either would, or ſhould, be infallibly <hi>ſaved,</hi> by means of what he ſpake, (for a few Verſes after, ſpeaking ſtill to the ſame perſons, he ſaith, <hi>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life;</hi>) but he declared, that the real deſire, and intent of his Heart and Soul, in ſpeaking to them as he did, was, <hi>that they might be ſaved;</hi> and withall, that the words, which he ſpake to them were ſuch, as by the due minding, and harkening whereunto, they might, and ſhould, have been <hi>ſaved.</hi> There is the ſame conſideration of what God ſaid unto <hi>Adam: Haſt thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thou ſhouldst not eat</hi>

And yet we know, that all theſe Promiſes and Engagements on Gods part not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, God, ſince the making of them, hath <hi>turned away from them,</hi> and that in greater diſpleaſure then ever before; yea, and that (as the Apoſtle ſaith) his <hi>Wrath is come upon them to the uttermost</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Theſ. 2, 16</note>; and they are accordingly at this day the moſt contemptible and miſerable Nation under Heaven. This plainly ſheweth, that all theſe Promiſes were Conditional, though no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition appears in mention, and the performance of them intentionally ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon their good behavior and obedience to him, that made them. See more upon this account in the Premiſſes <note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 10. Sect. 43.</note>. If then the temporal Promiſes running along in the ſame current of diſcourſe with ſpiritual, and much more aſſertively expreſſed, then theſe, were Conditional, and have ſuffered a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94900:130"/> through a non-performance of the Condition intended; why may we not ſuppoſe the ſpiritual Promiſes alſo to be ſubject to the ſame Law? Nay certainly,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Had the ſpiritual Promiſes been meerly poſitive and unconditioned, the temporal would have been ſuch alſo, at leaſt they had not been obnoxious to a non-performance. For had God actually, and with effect, <hi>given them one heart,</hi> and <hi>one way,</hi> ſo that <hi>they had</hi> actually <hi>feared him for ever,</hi> or <hi>put his fear in their hearts</hi> upon any ſuch <hi>terms,</hi> that they <hi>had not departed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from him,</hi> queſtionleſs all the temporal Promiſes had brought forth; God would <hi>not have turned away from them to do them good,</hi> and <hi>their children after them,</hi> but would <hi>have rejoyced over them to do them good,</hi> would have <hi>planted them in their Land, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. That expreſſion in the ſaid paſſages, <hi>And I will make an everlaſting CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENANT with them,</hi> plainly ſuppoſeth, that the whole Contexture of Promiſes therein, was but Conditional; it being the nature and property of a Covenant, never to engage one party alone, but both, or all, comprized in it: and when one party refuſeth to make good the terms impoſed thereby upon him, to diſ oblige and free the other. Therefore,</p>

(And laſtly) The true and clear intent and meaning of the ſpiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes<note place="margin">§. 55.</note> made unto the People of the Jews, now in captivity, in the Scripture in hand, and particularly of the expreſſions laſt objected, is this: <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever; and will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not,</hi> [or, may not] <hi>depart from me; i. e.</hi> I will deal ſo above meaſure graciouſly and bountifully with them, as well in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to their ſpiritual Condition, as in things which concern their outward Condition, that if they be not prodigiouſly refractary, ſtubborn, and unthankful, I will <hi>overcome their evil with</hi> my <hi>goodneſs,</hi> will cauſe them to own me for their God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will reduce them, as one man, to a loving and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al frame and temper of heart towards me, that they ſhall willingly, and with a full and free Purpoſe of heart, <hi>fear</hi> and ſerve me for ever. To ſecure this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That is to be remembred, which hath been offered to conſideration al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 10. Sect. 20.</note>

               <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the frequent and familiar Dialect of <hi>Scripture,</hi> to aſcribe the doing of things, or the effects themſelves, unto thoſe, whether God, or men, who either miniſter occaſion, or afford proper or likely means, or endevors, for the doing of them, whether ever they be actually effected, or no. A pleaſant number of Inſtances in this kinde you ſhall finde drawn together elſewhere <note n="b" place="margin">Ibidem.</note>. Repetitions are needleſs, where Primitives are at hand. According to this kinde of expreſſion, God may be ſaid to <hi>give men one heart, and one way, that &amp;c.</hi> and ſo, to <hi>put his fear into their hearts,</hi> that &amp;c. when he vouchſafeth and exhibiteth ſuch motives, means and opportunities unto them, which are efficacious and proper to work them to ſuch a frame and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heart and Soul, out of which men are wont firmly to reſolve, to love, ſerve and obey him for ever, whether they be actually wrought, or brought hereunto, or no. In this ſence it is eaſie to conceive, when, and how the ſaid Promiſes were performed or fulfilled, as, <hi>viz.</hi> to a good degree, in, upon, and ſoon after, that famous Deliverance out of their ſeventy years Captivity, God hereby, as by many other ſignal mercies vouchſafed unto them ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their return, about the repairing of their City and Temple, as likewiſe by the effectual Miniſtry of ſeveral great <hi>Prophets</hi> raiſed up amongſt them from time to time, mightily engaging them all to devote themſelves unto him
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94900:130"/> and his ſervice for ever: But more fully, and gloriouſly when the great <hi>Meſsiah</hi> was ſent unto them in the fleſh, by whoſe unparallel'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>olineſſe in Life and Converſation, together with His frequent and wonderfull miracles, and eſpecially by His Doctrine ſo full of Heavenly Authority, Light, and Power, they were only not compelled into ſuch an <hi>heart,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>way,</hi> wherewith, and wherein, to have <hi>feared, [i. e.</hi> to have religiouſly ſerved and obeyed] <hi>Him for ever.</hi> In ſo much that proving ſuch Apoſtates, as they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully became, under ſuch tranſcendent means as they had, to have rendered them the beſt and moſt faithfull People under Heaven unto their God, they declared themſelves to be the moſt ſtiff-necked and rebellious Generation of Men in all the World; and were judged by God accordingly. Take any other ſence of the Promiſes, or words now in queſtion, eſpecially that, which is ſo much contended for, and which imports a finall Perſeverance in grace to be wrought in this People by the irreſiſtible Hand of God; and it will be impoſſible for any Man to finde ſo much as by probable conjecture, when, or how, they ſhould ever be fulfilled. To ſay, that they might, even in that ſence, which I ſo much oppoſe, be <hi>fulfilled</hi> conſtantly in the Elect of this People, is to ſay that, which reaſon will gaineſay. For, 1. An abſolute or un-conditioned Promiſe made to a great number of Men, cannot be ſaid to be fulfilled, when the thing promiſed is exhibited only to ſome few of them. Now the Promiſes under debate, were cleerly made to the whole body or nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> (as we have formerly proved from the expreſſe Context) and not to the Elect only amongſt them. 2. According to their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who plead the fulfilling of them in this ſence, the Perſons for whoſe ſakes and comfort they were made, the Elect, might, yea muſt needs have had, every whit as much comfort without them, as they could have, with, or by them. For they knew, before the making, of any of theſe Promiſes to them, that being Elect, and once in an eſtate of grace, they ſhould perſevere therein unto the end. And thus theſe great and ſignall Promiſes of God ſhall be rendred voyd, and meere impertinencies unto thoſe, for whoſe ſake only they are ſuppoſed to have been made. 3. (And laſtly) to ſay they were <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> in the Elect, (in the ſence gaineſaid) is to <hi>begg</hi> the queſtion, inſtead of <hi>digging</hi> for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> many times aſſert the futurity, or comming to paſſe<note place="margin">§. 56.</note> of things not yet in being, not only when the comming of them to paſſe, is certaine, or certainly known unto God, but upon a probability only, or likelyhood of their comming to paſſe, in reſpect of means uſed, or to be uſed, for the bringing of them to paſſe. Upon this account, God Himſelf is repreſented by our Saviour in his parable of the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> as ſpeaking thus, in the perſon of <hi>the Lord of the Vin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94900:131"/> amongſt them from the like ſins. See <hi>Sect.</hi> 50. of this <hi>Chapter.</hi> In this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and idiome of <hi>Scripture</hi> alſo, God may ſay, <hi>I will give them one Heart, and one way, that they may feare Me for ever,</hi> not out of a certainty of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or determination in Himſelf, that any ſuch <hi>Heart,</hi> or <hi>Way,</hi> ſhould actually, and with effect, be <hi>given</hi> unto them, which would infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch an effect in them, as is here ſpecified; but becauſe he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſo to intreat them, and to afford ſuch excellent adminiſtrations of His Grace and Spirit unto them, which ſhould be very Pregnant, Proper, and Efficacious, to create ſuch an <hi>Heart</hi> in them, and to put them into ſuch a <hi>Way,</hi> that they ſhould never have declined from His Worſhip and Service, whileſt the Sun and Moone endure. This anſwer (I acknowledge) is of much affinity with the former. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, that no ſuch ſence was intended by God in the Words or Promiſes yet under conſideration, which imports any certainty of a finall perſeverance in Grace, in thoſe, to whom they are ſpoken and made, fully appeares from all thoſe propheticall paſſages and predictions in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which are many in number, and very plaine and pregnant in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, wherein that ſad breach, which afterwards happened between God, and this People, to whom theſe Promiſes were made, and which amounted even to a rejection of them from being any longer a People unto Him, is foretold by Him. For that God ſhould abſolutely promiſe ſuch an <hi>Heart</hi> unto a People, which ſhould infallibly cauſe them to <hi>feare Him for ever,</hi> and not to <hi>depart</hi> from him; and yet withall prophecy the great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Apoſtaſie of this People from him, and their rejection, upon that account, by him, doubtleſſe lieth not within the verge of any Mans belief, who takes any competent care what he believeth. I truſt, the <hi>Scripture</hi> now laſt Opened, will from <hi>henceforth</hi> be <hi>put to no</hi> more <hi>trouble,</hi> about any Contribution of aid towards the maintenance of the Doctrine of abſolute perſeverance.</p>
            <p>Some other <hi>Scriptures</hi> poſſibly there may be, beſides thoſe inquired into in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> wherein ſome may imagine the treaſure of ſuch a perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to be hid: but theſe which we have ſtrictly examined upon the matter, have ſtill been counted the <hi>Pillars</hi> of that Doctrine; and yet, as we have ſeen, are no ſupporters of it.

            </argument>
            <p>WE ſhall begin with that, which is the <hi>Firſt borne</hi> of the <hi>strength</hi> of<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> our Adverſaries in this kinde. <hi>That</hi> (ſay they) <hi>which God hath Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in His Word, is certaine, and ſhall take place against all oppoſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction whatſoever. But God hath Promiſed in his Word that all true Believers ſhall both totally and finally Perſevere. Therefore all ſuch ſhall certainly ſo Perſevere, againſt whatſoever may, or ſhall at any time oppoſe their Preſevering.</hi> To this I Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By explaining the major propoſition. <hi>What God hath Promiſed in His Word, is certaine, and ſhall take place, &amp;c. viz.</hi> in ſuch a ſence, and upon ſuch terms, as God would be underſtood in His promiſe. But what <hi>God Promiſeth</hi> in one ſence, is not <hi>certaine</hi> of performance, in another. As for example: God promiſed the preſervation of the lives of all that were with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Ship; but his intent and meaning in this promiſe, was not this preſervation againſt whatſoever might poſſibly be done by thoſe in the Ship, againſt it, or to hinder it; but with this proviſo, or condition, that they in the Ship ſhould hearken unto him, and follow his advice in order to their preſervation; as is evident from thoſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, to whom this promiſe was made: <hi>Except theſe abide in the Ship, yee cannot be ſafe</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 27. 31.</note>. So that had the <hi>Centurion</hi> and reſt in the Ship ſuffered the Mariners to have left the Ship, whileſt it was yet at Sea, there had been no failing in promiſe with God, though they had all been drowned. In like manner, though <hi>Chriſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to His twelve Apoſtles, <hi>Judas</hi> being yet one of the twelve, that <hi>in the Regeneration (i. e.</hi> in the Reſurrection, or Reſtauration of the World) <hi>they ſhould fit upon twelve Thrones, and judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 19. 28.</note>, yet is he not to be judged a promiſe-breaker, though <hi>Judas</hi> never comes to ſit upon one of theſe <hi>Thrones.</hi> And in caſe the reſt of the twelve had declined, from that integrity of Heart, under which that promiſe was made unto them, as <hi>Judas</hi> did, neither would it have argued any breach of promiſe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to have advanced others upon theſe <hi>Thrones,</hi> inſtead of them. The reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is elſewhere noted from <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> whoſe Doctrine it is, that <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are wont to be made with reſpect had to the preſent eſtate and condition of things with Men</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Promiſſiones itaque illae Dei pro ſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentirerum ſunt intelligendae. P. Mar. Loc. Claſſ. 3. c. 13. Sect. 4.</note>. His meaning is (as appeares by the tenor of the adjacent Diſcourſe) that all Gods promiſes made unto Men, being, or conſidered as being, under ſuch, and ſuch qualifications, are not to be underſtood as any otherwiſe intended by him to be performed unto them, then as abiding, and whileſt they ſhall abide, in the ſame qualifications. As for example, what promiſes ſoever God makes unto Believers, with reſpect had to their Faith, or as they are Believers, are not to be looked upon as performable or oblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Maker of them unto them, in caſe they ſhall relapſe into their former unbelief. But of this we ſpake plentifully in our laſt Chapter <note n="d" place="margin">Sect. 43. &amp; 51. See alſo Sect. 9. of this Chapter.</note>, and elſewhere. The major propoſition thus explained and underſtood, we admit. <hi>Whatſoever God Promiſeth, is certaine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> according to the true intent and meaning of the promiſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> alſo, releived with an Orthodox and ſober Explication, (as<note place="margin">§. 2.</note>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:94900:132"/> likewiſe the concluſion it ſelf, and whole Argument) is blameleſs, and <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no evil</hi> againſt the Doctrine now under vindication. For in this ſence it is moſt true, that <hi>God hath promiſed that all true Beleevers ſhall perſevere; i. e.</hi> that <hi>all true Beleevers,</hi> formally conſidered, <hi>i. e.</hi> as ſuch, and abiding ſuch, <hi>ſhall perſevere, viz.</hi> in his grace and favor. But this (I preſume) is not the ſence of the Argument-makers. Their meaning is, that God hath promiſed that <hi>all true Beleevers</hi> ſhall <hi>perſevere</hi> thus beleeving, or in the truth of their Faith, againſt all interveniences whatſoever: and that he will ſo interpoſe with his Grace and Power, that none of them ſhall ever make ſhipwrack of their faith, upon what quick-ſands of luſt and ſenſuality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſoever they ſhall ſtrike, againſt what rocks of obduration and impenitency ſoever they ſhall daſh. In this ſence their Propoſition (I confeſs) is <hi>ſore</hi> againſt us, but their Proofs are weak and contemptible: nor will any of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> from which they claim countenance and confirmation, own the cauſe, or comport with them therein. Some of the faireſt appearance and greateſt hope that way, we examined narrowly in the next preceding <hi>Chapter,</hi> and found them in heart much eſtranged from them; as, <hi>viz. Jer. 32. 38, 39, 40. Mat. 16. 18. Joh.</hi> 10. 9. with ſome others. I acknowledg that there are ſeveral others, beſides thoſe there diſcharged, choſen by men of that judgment, to ſerve in the ſame warfare: but they are all of the ſame minde with their fellows, who (as we have heard) detract that ſervice. Moſt of theſe are Promiſes anciently made unto the Jewiſh Nation in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all, or moſt of them, of like import, with that <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 39, &amp;c. (large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened towards the end of the former <hi>Chapter</hi>) and are to be meaſured with the ſame line of interpretation. Nor can it ever be ſo much as compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently proved, that they were made with appropriation unto Saints, or unto true Beleevers, but unto the body and generality of that People, or Nation, which we mentioned. The particulars are theſe: <hi>For the mountains ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and the hills be removed; but my kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the Covenant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord that hath mercy on thee</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Iſai. 54. 10</note>. So again: <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth, and for ever</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Iſai. 59. 21</note>. And again: <hi>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever, yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in loving kindneſs, and in mercy: I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulneſs</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 20, 21</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe Places, evident it is, that there is nothing aſſerted,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> or promiſed by God therein, but onely his faithfulneſs in his Promiſes, and the ſure and certain performance of his <hi>Covenant.</hi> But that the tenor or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this <hi>Covenant</hi> ſhould be, that they who once truly <hi>beleeve,</hi> ſhould be by him infallibly, and by a ſtrong hand, againſt all interpoſals of ſin, wickedneſs, backſliding, rebellion, whatſoever, preſerved i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſuch a Faith, is not ſo much as by any word, ſyllable, <hi>iota,</hi> or tittle, here intimated. Yea, that it is contrary to the nature of a <hi>Covenant</hi> to impoſe Articles and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions upon one Party onely, and to leave the other free, was lately ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 10. Sect. 54.</note>. And particularly, that God required terms of thoſe, with whom he made, or was about to make the <hi>Covenant</hi> here ſpoken of, is evident from Verſ. 3. of the following <hi>Chapter: Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your Soul ſhall live: and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David.</hi> The plain meaning whereof clearly is, that upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94900:132"/> of their obedience and faithfulneſs unto him, he would engage himſelf to be a God and glorious Benefactor unto them for ever, and that the breach ſhould never be on his ſide.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſecond Place, <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> 1. It may as well be conceived to hold forth a charge or injunction of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the People, as a Promiſe from God of any thing. And Mr <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, upon the Place, acknowledgeth that ſome tranſlate the words in the Imperative Mood, <hi>Let not my words depart,</hi> and granteth withall, that the Future tenſe will bear an Imperative conſtruction. According to this ſence, the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>this is my Covenant with them,</hi> is this; That Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Perpetual Grace and Mercy, which I make with them, requireth this of them, in order to the performance of it on my Part, that they quench not my <hi>Spirit,</hi> which I ſhall put into them, nor forſake my Word, that I ſhall teach them. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we look upon the Paſſage as Promiſſory, there is little reaſon to judg it as promiſing the gift, or Grace of Perſeverance unto true Beleevers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their deportment ſhall be. (For, as for Conditional Promiſes unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers of Perſeverance in Faith unto the end, as, <hi>viz.</hi> upon their Chriſtian and good behavior, diligence, &amp;c. I queſtion not, but that the <hi>Scripture</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) And that the Promiſe contained in this Verſe (if there be any ſuch thing in it) be it a Promiſe of Perſeverance in Faith, or of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beſides, is none other (I mean, then Conditional,) cannot reaſonably be gain-ſay'd, or the contrary proved.

But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Be it granted, that the words in debate are Promiſſive, and that whether<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> with Condition, or without Condition, yet nothing can be more clear, then this, that they are, or were, directed and ſpoken, not (as was ſaid concerning the former Paſſage) to Saints, or true Beleevers onely, but to the whole Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> or Nation of the Jews. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (queſtionleſs) underſtood them, thus directed and meant; as appears, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26. where he applies the Promiſe contained in the words immediately preceding (with a little expoſitory variation of them, after the New-Teſtament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> manner) to this whole Nation. <hi>And ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, there ſhall come out of Zion a Deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob. For this is my Covenant unto them, when I ſhall take away their ſins.</hi> Meaning, that when the time cometh, that upon the Repentance of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſhall pardon that great and grievous Apoſtacy and Rebellion, under the guilt whereof they have layn for many generations, he will give <hi>Salvation</hi> unto them all, <hi>i. e.</hi> freedom from all their preſent miſeries and calamities, by the Hand of a great <hi>Redeemer,</hi> or <hi>Deliverer,</hi> who <hi>ſhall come out of Sion, (i. e.</hi> whoſe deſcent ſhall be of themſelves: or, who ſhall <hi>come out of Sion, i. e.</hi> out of Heaven, typified by Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and which may be called, <hi>Sion myſtical;</hi>) and he <hi>ſhall turn away ungodlineſs</hi> from <hi>Jacob; Ungodlineſs, i. e.</hi> (in that dialect, ſo frequent in <hi>Scripture,</hi> wherein ſin, is put for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, as Righteouſneſs alſo, for the reward of Righteouſneſs,) the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of that ſignal <hi>Ungodlineſs,</hi> from the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> [the <hi>Jews</hi>] for
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94900:133"/> which they have ſuffered the Heavy Diſpleaſure of God ſo long. Or thus: <hi>He ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob; i. e.</hi> partly by means of that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deliverance, which he ſhall bring unto them, partly by other gracious Adminiſtrations of his towards, and amongſt them, he ſhall preſerve them, or turn them away (for, to <hi>turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob,</hi> is, I ſuppoſe, by an <hi>Hypallage,</hi> put for, turning away <hi>Jacob</hi> from ungodlineſs,) from the <hi>Ungodlineſs</hi> of that unthankfulneſs and backſliding, whereunto they and their Forefathers have been ſo extreamly ſubject from the beginning. Now then, the Verſe and words immediately preceding, being Promiſſory, and that to the whole Nation, it is no ways like, but that the Verſe and words following, being Promiſſory alſo, and every ways as appropriable and appliable to the whole Nation, as they, ſhould be every whit as comprehenſive, or extenſive in reſpect of their object, as they. Nor are there wanting amongſt our beſt Reformed Expoſitors, who thus underſtand them: let <hi>Muſculus</hi> be conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the place.</p>

Evident it is, that this Promiſe exhibiteth and holdeth forth ſome new grace or favour, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which God had not vouchſafed any formerly, either unto the perſons to whom the ſaid Promiſe is now made, or to any other.

            <p n="6">6. And laſtly, It is very unproper, and doth not look like one of the wiſe Diſpenſations of God, to make a ſerious and ſolemn Promiſe unto men of that, which they might, and ought, to expect of courſe, yea, and which they might, with as much comfort and ſecurity, have promiſed unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as he. For according to thoſe Principles, which we now oppoſe, every true Beleever, may, and ought, to expect the grace of final Perſeverance from God, as matter of courſe, and of common and unalterable Diſpenſation; yea, and ſhall ſin, if he doth it not.</p>
            <p>If you ask, but if the Promiſe now in diſcourſe, be not a Promiſe of final<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> Perſeverance, what is the matter or ſubſtance of it, or what doth God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in it? Let <hi>Muſculus,</hi> a Learned and Orthodox Expoſitor, anſwer you. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) in this Promiſe, <hi>ſpeaks of the Spirit and Word of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: both which he did put upon</hi> [or, into] <hi>his people</hi> [meaning, the <hi>Iews] in the beginning of the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel: nor hath he taken them away hitherto, however blindneſs may ſeem to have wholy poſſeſſed Iſrael. For there are ſome of this Nation that are continually converted unto Chriſt, in whom the continuation of the Spirit and Word of God may</hi> [or, will] <hi>take place, until the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in, and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved</hi>

               </note>. So that he placeth the ſubſtance of the Promiſe in this, that the Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> ſhall never,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94900:133"/> from the days of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Fleſh, be wholly, altogether, or in all the members of it, deſtitute of the Spirit and Word of <hi>Christ.</hi> This Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuppoſeth nothing in the Promiſe for the buſineſs of final Perſeverance. Notwithſtanding I conceive that God here rather promiſeth this; <hi>viz.</hi> that He will advance the Diſpenſations of His Grace and Goodneſs towards, and amongſt, this people, to ſuch an excellency and height, that if they prove not extreamly unworthy, and neglective above meaſure of their own Happineſs, they ſhall have of the Spirit and Word of God abundantly amongſt them, and conſequently abundance of Peace and Happineſs for ever. The Promiſe thus underſtood began to operate and work, and was performed in part, in, and upon their Deliverance from that ſeventy years captivity; wrought yet more effectually, at the coming of the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> unto them in the Fleſh: but the full and ſignal accompliſhment of it remaineth yet behinde, and ſhall take place, when the <hi>Redeemer ſhall come out of Sion unto them,</hi> and their <hi>Meſsiah</hi> viſit them the ſecond time.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 8.</note> 
               <hi>thee unto me for ever, &amp;c.</hi> it is much of the ſame conſideration with the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; nor hath any whit more in it to ſupport the common Doctrine of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, then they. For, 1. the Promiſe of the <hi>betrothing</hi> here ſpecified, is made unto the intire Body and Nation of the Jews, as well Unbeleevers, as Beleevers, as appears by the carriage of the <hi>Chapter</hi> throughout. 2. It is Conditional, and the performance of it (I mean, of the <hi>betrothing</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in it) ſuſpended upon the Repentance of this <hi>People</hi> (eſpecially of their Idolatry) and return to the true and pure Worſhip of God, as appears Verſ. 14, 16, 17, &amp;c. which plainly ſheweth, that it was made as well (nay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to thoſe that were wicked and Idolatrous amongſt this <hi>People,</hi> then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others; as being adminiſtred and held forth unto them chiefly for this end, to wooe them away from their Idols unto God. 3. Nor can it be proved, that this Promiſe ſo properly, or directly, intends the collation of ſpiritual or heavenly good things unto them, as temporal. Yea, the ſcituation of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween temporal Promiſes immediately, both behinde it, and before it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the contrary. Read the Context, from Verſ. 18. to the end of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> Therefore, 4. and laſtly, the true intent and purpoſe of this place and Promiſe, <hi>And I will betroth thee, &amp;c.</hi> is, as if he ſhould have ſaid; When I ſhall by my Word and Spirit and other gracious Adminiſtrations, wherein I ſhall appear to this <hi>People,</hi> ſo far prevail with them, and overcome them, as to cauſe them to caſt away their Idols, and turn with their whole heart unto me, I will expreſs my ſelf ſo, with ſo much love and affection unto them, that they ſhall not lightly, neither they, nor their children after them, go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whoring from me any more, but remain united unto me in a mutual chaſte conjugal affection for ever. <hi>I will betroth them unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in loving kindneſs, and in mercy: q. d.</hi> I will engage and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to inſure, both them, and their affections unto me, by all variety of ways and means, that are proper and likely to bring ſuch a thing to paſs; as, 1. By ſhewing my ſelf juſt and <hi>righteous</hi> unto them in keeping my Promiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Deliverance out of Captivity at the end of ſeventy years: I will not fail them herein, no not to a day, or hour. 2. By puniſhing and <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> their Enemies, and deſtroying thoſe that led them captive, and held them in bondage and ſubjection. 3. By heaping the fruits of my love and kindneſs upon them otherwiſe, as in giving them peace, plenty, health, honour, &amp;c. in abundance. 4. And laſtly, by dealing <hi>mercifully</hi> with them, in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94900:134"/> their ſins and infirmities, which they will commit dayly againſt me; I will not be extream to mark what they ſhall do amiſs, whileſt their hearts ſhall remain perfect with me. <hi>I will even betroth them unto me in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: i. e.</hi> By theſe and all other ways and means likely to endear my ſelf unto them, and to aſſure them and their affections unto my ſelf, for ever, I will really and effectually eſſay and try to doe it. An aire of this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the place breaths in the Annotations of our Engliſh Divines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon it, who Paraphraſe it, thus: <hi>I will betroth thee] I will re-establiſh my Covenant of Grace with thee, not only to obſerve that Faith which is required in all Covenants, but alſo to forgive thee thy ſins, and not to take notice of thy unworthineſſe.</hi> But according to the Sence and Expoſition of the place given (which cannot reaſonably be gaineſaid) the Promiſe therein is not abſolute as to the effect of ſuch a deſponſation of this People, which ſhould ſtand <hi>for ever,</hi> but only as to the means, yet theſe very efficacious and proper, to be uſed by God for the producing ſuch an effect. And thus, <hi>Tarnovius,</hi> a late and learned Expoſitor of the Reformed Religion, underſtands it. <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth thee unto me] whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou formerly deſpiſed'ſt, and ſhamefully forſookeſt, and,</hi> AS MVCH AS IN ME LIETH, <hi>whoſe gifts are without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> Rom. 11. 29. <hi>this betrothing ſhall ſtand firme for ever, nor ſhall this ſpiritual conjunction between us ever be diſſolved, as formerly</hi>

So that all things conſidered, it is a little ſtrange to me, that learned and ſober Men ſhould ever be tempted to build the Doctrine of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, as they forme and teach it, upon ſuch <hi>Scriptures</hi> as this, and thoſe lately opened.</p>
            <p>But beſides places of this impreſe, and thoſe diſmiſſed in the former<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> Chapter, they inſiſt upon others, to prove, that God hath made an abſolute promiſe of finall perſeverance unto all true Believers. Let us then briefly <hi>try the ſpirit</hi> of theſe: for if we can ſinde ſo much as any one promiſe from God of ſuch an import, in all the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> all oppoſition muſt keep ſilence for ever. Some ſuppoſe they deſcry ſuch a promiſe as we ſpeak of, in that of <hi>David, They that trust in the Lord, ſhall be as Mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 125. 1.</note>. I anſwer, here is no promiſe that they that <hi>truſt in the Lord, ſhall abide</hi> truſting in the Lord <hi>for ever,</hi> or, that they ſhall not be <hi>removed</hi> from this truſting in Him <hi>for ever;</hi> but only, that <hi>truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in Him, and abiding ſo <hi>truſting,</hi> they ſhall never be <hi>removed, [viz.</hi> from an eſtate, or condition of peace and happineſſe, into an eſtate of trouble, or miſery.] For it is a ſtability of happineſſe or ſafety, not of Faith, that is here promiſed unto thoſe that <hi>truſt in the Lord.</hi> If it be objected, that even a ſtability in happineſſe, ſuppoſeth, or includeth, a ſtability in Faith; in as much as no Man can make ſhipwrack of his Faith, but his happineſſe is wrack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it; I anſwer; that the meaning of the promiſe in hand, is not, that they who at preſent <hi>truſt in the Lord,</hi> let them at any time herafter truſt, or diſtruſt Him, ſhall yet be unremoveably happy: nor to imply, that they who once, or at any time truſt in the Lord, ſhall be neceſſitated by him to truſt in Him

Sect. 43. and Sect 51. &amp; Sect. 54 &amp; Sect. 1. of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>; that the Promiſes of God made unto Men with reſpect to ſuch and ſuch ſpeciall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, are to be underſtood with ſuch an Explication or Caution, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with His threatnings againſt ſuch and ſuch particular ſins are to be interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor 6. 9.</note>, and <hi>John Baptiſt, that he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life,</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Joh. 3. 36.</note> &amp;c. the meaning is not, that they that are now <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,</hi> or <hi>unbelieving,</hi> though they ſhould repent and believe hereafter, ſhould yet be excluded from <hi>the Kingdome of God;</hi> but that unleſſe they ſhall repent of their ſins, they ſhould for them be excluded. In like manner, when God Promiſeth ſtability of condition, ſafety, ſalvation, or the like, unto thoſe that believe, and truſt in Him, He intends no obligation hereby to theſe perſons, otherwiſe then upon their abiding ſuch in thoſe qualifications, as of Faith, and truſting in Him, in regard whereof the ſaid Promiſes were made to them.

This, by comparing the words tranſcribed, with thoſe in the former Verſe, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: <hi>Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, Whoſoever drinketh of this water, (i. e.</hi> of material water, ſuch as this well affordeth,) <hi>ſhall thirſt again; [i. e.</hi> is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, notwithſtanding his drinking hereof, to thirſt again.] <hi>But whoſoever drinketh of the water, that I ſhall give him, &amp;c. q. d.</hi> The beſt means that can be had, or enjoyed, to render this preſent life, which we live, free from incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, and that which is troubleſom, and contrary to it, will not effect it, the condition of this life, being ſubject to diſſolution, will not admit of any ſuch freedom, or perfection: but whoſoever ſhall <hi>drink</hi> [inwardly receive and beleeve] that Doctrine, which I ſhall adminiſter unto him, ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be made partaker of ſuch a <hi>life,</hi> which ſhall within a ſhort time (if men be careful in the <hi>interim</hi> to preſerve it) by reaſon of the nature and perfect condition and conſtitution of it, be exempt from all ſorrow, trouble, and inconvenience whatſoever, as being <hi>eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, 1. that he doth not oppoſe that life, which accrues unto men by<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> 
               <hi>drinking the water, which he gives</hi> them, unto that natural life, which they live, by other means, in reſpect of the preſent condition or conſtitution of it, or as it is enjoyed by men in this preſent world, is evident from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he aſſerts it free from <hi>thirſt, [ſhall never thirſt.</hi>] Now we know, that the Saints themſelves, notwithſtanding the life of Grace which is in them, by <hi>drinking the water</hi> that <hi>Chriſt hath given them,</hi> are yet ſubject to both kindes of <hi>thirſt,</hi> as well that which is corporal, or natural, as that which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: yea, that <hi>ſpiritual thirſt,</hi> unto which they are now ſubject, though it argues a deficiency of what they would further have, or deſire to be, and in that reſpect is troubleſom, yet is it argumentative of the goodneſs or bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their condition. <hi>Bleſſed are they which hunger and thirſt after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: for they ſhall be filled</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 5 6.</note>. By the way, this <hi>ſpiritual thirſt,</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident even unto that <hi>life</hi> which is derived by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>waters given</hi> by him, unto men, as it is enjoyed or poſſeſſed by them in this preſent world, is, according to the purport of our Saviours own arguing in the <hi>Scripture</hi> under debate, an Argument, that for the preſent, and whileſt it is obnoxious to ſuch a <hi>thirſt,</hi> it is diſſolveable, and may fail. For in the latter part of the ſaid paſſage, he plainly implies, that the <hi>eternalneſs</hi> of that <hi>life,</hi> which ſprings from the <hi>drinking</hi> of his <hi>waters,</hi> is the reaſon or cauſe why it is exempt from <hi>thirſt.</hi> Let the whole paſſage be read, and minded, and this will clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. If then the <hi>eternality</hi> of a <hi>life</hi> be the cauſe or reaſon why it is free from the inconveniency of <hi>thirſt,</hi> evident it is, that ſuch a <hi>life,</hi> which is not
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94900:135"/> free from <hi>thirſt,</hi> is not, during this weakneſs or imperfection of it, <hi>eternal,</hi> or priviledged againſt all diſſolution. I eaſily grant, that ſuch a <hi>life</hi> as we now ſpeak of, may, notwithſtanding the diſſolvableneſs of it, be (in a ſence) called, <hi>Eternal,</hi> (as it is frequently called in the <hi>Scriptures</hi>) viz. <hi>in ſemine,</hi> or <hi>in fieri</hi> (as they ſay) as the conception of a man in the womb, may be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a man; or becauſe in reſpect of the native and in-bred tendency of it, and being duly nouriſhed and preſerved, it is apt in time to become <hi>Eternal</hi> (formally and properly ſo called) even as the conception of a man in the womb, by reaſon of the natural frame and tendency of it, will in time, if it meets with no unnatural and deſtructive accident by the way, come to be a <hi>man</hi> in his full ſtature and ſtrength. But as this frame or tendency of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception we ſpeak of, doth no ways prove, that therefore it muſt of neceſſity, or what will, or can, befall it, come in time to be a perfect man: ſo neither is it neceſſary, that that life in the Saints, which is ſeminally, inchoately, and conception-wiſe, <hi>Eternal,</hi> ſhould againſt all poſſible occurrences of things adverſe to it, come to be actually, properly, and compleatly <hi>Eternal.</hi> The reſult of this diſcourſe amounts clearly to this, that our Saviour, in the words in hand, doth not oppoſe the life which comes by <hi>drinking</hi> his <hi>water,</hi> to the life of Nature, in reſpect of the preſent and imperfect condition of it, in this World, but in reſpect of the future and compleat growth and condition of it in the World to come. Therefore,</p>

Therefore neither is there any Promiſe in this <hi>Scripture,</hi> of ſuch a Perſeverance of the Saints in Faith, as is commonly notioned amongſt us, and hath been oppoſed hitherto.</p>
            <p>Another place wherein the ſaid Minor Propoſition (in the ſence intended<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> by the Aſſertors) is pretended to be found, conſiſts of theſe words: <hi>And I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abide with you for ever</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

               <note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 28. 20</note>. And to put our <hi>Saviours</hi> meaning in the words in hand, into words of more plainneſs, it was as if He ſhould have ſaid to His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, thus: The Counſel and Purpoſe of my Father, in ſending me into the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:94900:136"/> World, required that I ſhould make no long ſtay, or abode in it, but that I ſhould return by the way of Death again unto Him, after a ſeaſon; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I am now upon my Return, and ſo muſt leave you: but when I ſhall have finiſhed my Return unto my Father, and am come to Him, I will intercede for you, and <hi>he will ſend you another Comforter,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt, upon better terms, for ſtaying and continuing with you, then thoſe on which I came: for He ſhall be ſent, not to be taken out of the World by Death, as I muſt be, but to make His reſidence with, and amongſt you, my friends and faithful ones, for ever. This to be our Saviours expreſs drift and ſcope in the words, appears by the carriage of the greateſt part of the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pter. Now from ſuch an <hi>abiding</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt with them, as this, cannot be inferred His perpetual <hi>abiding</hi> with any one perſon, or Beleever, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately, much leſs with every one.</p>

If the latter be admitted, neither will it follow, that every Beleever, or every Member of the Church, muſt needs have the Reſidence of the <hi>Spirit</hi> with him <hi>for ever.</hi> There are Priviledges appropriate to Corporations, or Bodies Politique, which every particular Member of theſe Bodies cannot claim. The Church may have the Reſidence or Preſence of the Spirit of God with her <hi>for ever;</hi> and yet every preſent Member hereof loſe his preſent Intereſt and Part in Him. Yea that the <hi>abiding for ever</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Apoſtles themſelves, was not abſolutely promiſed unto them, appears from thoſe, and ſuch like paſſages of our Saviour unto them. <hi>If ye ſhall keep my Commandments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye ſhall</hi> ABIDE <hi>in my</hi>

            <p>Another piece of Scripture, by which the Argument, now ſhaking, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedly<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> ſtrengthened, is that of the Apoſtle: <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is common to Man: but God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that yee are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that yee may be able to bear it</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

Which rather proveth, that ſuch a <hi>preſervation</hi> might poſſibly have been withheld, or denyed by God unto them, then the contrary. For thoſe things are more likely to be ſought by Prayer, which may poſſibly not be granted, or obtained otherwiſe, then ſuch, which might with the greateſt confidence be expected upon another account, and without ſuch Prayer. And beſides, what Efficacy or Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency with God can be aſcribed unto ſuch a Prayer, which ſeeketh ſuch things at His hand, to the exhibition whereof He ſtands abſolutely ingaged by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Purpoſe, or the like, and which ſhould have been exhibited and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94900:138"/> given by Him, whether ſuch Prayer had been made unto Him, or no?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſame thing (in effect) which the Apoſtle here prayeth that God would do for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> in other places he exhorteth men themſelves to do: which plainly ſheweth that the intent and purport of the Apoſtles Prayer in this place, was not that he would by a peremptory and irreſiſtible hand <hi>preſerve them blameleſs, &amp;c.</hi> (which is His manner of acting in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all His abſolute Promiſes) but that he would afford unto them ſuch gracious excitements, quickenings and enlargements of Heart and ſpirit, by His Spirit, whereby they might be effectually provoked and engaged to put forth themſelves to do what was requiſite on their parts, for, and towards, ſuch an actual preſerving of themſelves; which notwithſtanding, he clearly ſuppoſeth (in the Paſſages immediately ſubjoyned) that they very poſſibly might not do, even under ſuch excitements and enlargements. <hi>I give thee charge</hi> (ſaith this Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy) in the ſight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Jeſus Chriſt,—That thou keep this Commandment without ſpot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>

As for example: Suppoſe four or five Horſes yoked in a Team, and that one or two of theſe ſhould pull or draw luſtily, yet becauſe the reſt are jadiſh, and lazy, and will not put their ſhoulders to it, the wain, being heavy laden, ſticks faſt in the ſlow, &amp; is not drawn out; in this caſe, becauſe the Horſes ſuppoſed to pull ſtoutly, do as much for their parts, as was requiſite for them to do towards the drawing of it out, and that which would actually have drawn it out, in caſe their fellows had joyned, as they ought and might, in the ſame act of drawing with them, there is no reaſon why they ſhould loſe the credit or commendation of their activity, through the jadiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their fellows, nor [conſequently] why they ſhould not be ſaid to have drawn the Wain out of the mire. In like manner when God contributes his efficiency towards the keeping of men <hi>blameleſs,</hi> and that ſuch an efficiency, which being ſeconded and complied with by them, according to their duties, and abilities for the action, would actually produce the effect, and keep them <hi>blameleſs</hi> indeed, there is no reaſon why he ſhould be deprived of the honor of his action becauſe men are ſlothful, and will not act with him; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently why he ſhould not be ſaid to keep them <hi>blameleſs,</hi> how blame-worthy in the mean time ſoever they be, through their own default. For of the two it is a more honorable expreſsion, to ſay, that a man did ſuch, or ſuch a worthy action, then, that he did ſomewhat towards it. And for as much as, 1. God doth no more towards the keeping of thoſe Saints of his, <hi>blameleſs,</hi> who are actually and indeed kept <hi>blameleſs,</hi> then he either doth, or is ready to do in a regular way, towards the keeping of others of them <hi>blameleſs,</hi> who yet miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry: And, 2. conſidering, that when any of the Saints are actually kept

               <hi>blameleſſe</hi> through that gracious ſupply of his Spirit, and other means vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed by him in order thereunto (though not without their own care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with him herein) the honor of this action, or keeping <hi>blameleſſe,</hi> is moſt properly due unto him; there is no reaſon why it ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto him in the former caſe, as well as in the latter, or that he ſhould not be as well ſaid to keep thoſe <hi>blameleſſe,</hi> who only through their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe, prove blame-worthy, as thoſe, who through his grace attended with their own endeavours, are kept blameleſs. It is a ſaying approved (I ſuppoſe) on all hands,</p>
            <q>
               <l>—<hi>careat ſucceſsibus opto,</hi>

            <p>A third Argument layed hold on, for the ſervice of the Doctrine of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> is founded upon the immutable Decree of Election from eternity; and operates after this manner. A living or ſaving Faith is given to none, but to thoſe that are Elect: in which reſpect, ſuch a Faith is called <hi>the Faith of the Elect of God</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Tit. 1. 1.</note>. And God hath determined, to bring his Elect to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94900:140"/> by Faith, with the greateſt certainty, that can be. From hence then it follows, either that the Elect muſt be brought to Salvation by Faith with ſo much certainty, that they ſhall never fall away from it, either totally, or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, or that God is changeable in His Counſell. But this latter is at no hand to be admitted: therefore the former muſt ſtand. To this I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

The Scripture knoweth no ſuch ſence or ſignification of the Words, as this. Nor can it be proved from hence, nor otherwiſe, that Men are in any other ſence choſen or ſaid to be choſen, from eternity, but only as that Law or Decree of God, by vertue whereof Men come to be <hi>elected</hi> in time, was from eternity. The tenor of Gods Law or Decree of Election, which was from eternity, is (as the Scripture evidenceth) this, or the like.

            <p>A fourth Argument for the countenance of the ſaid Doctrine of Perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> is taken from the interceſſion of Chriſt, and pleadeth thus. <hi>Whatſoever Christ Prayeth for unto the Father, ſhall certainly be granted unto him, and done. But Chriſt prayeth for the Perſeverance of all true Believers, as appears by his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Peter in this kind</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 22. 32</note>. <hi>Ergo.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the major Propoſition, by granting it, rightly underſtood, and with ſome ſuch Explication as this. <hi>Whatſoever Christ prayeth for, unto the Father, ſhall certainly be done; viz.</hi> So, or after ſuch a manner, and upon ſuch terms, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> in His Prayer intendeth, not ſimply or abſolutely, as the words of the Prayer may ſometimes ſeeme to ſome to import. Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the croſſe, He Prayed for His enemies, and thoſe that crucified Him, that they might be <hi>Forgiven</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 23. 34</note>. May it not be as well inferred from hence, that therefore all his enemies, and all ſuch, who (in any ſence) Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie Him, ſhall be <hi>Forgiven</hi> by God, as it is argued from His Praying for <hi>Peter,</hi> that his <hi>Faith might not faile,</hi> that the Faith of no true Believer ſhall faile? Doctor <hi>Twists</hi> notion upon the caſe is not ſo authentique: and though admitted, will not heale the difficulty. <hi>Christ</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Prayed for his enemies, ex officio hominis Privati,</hi> i, e. <hi>according to the duty of a private Man: but for His Elect, as Mediator.</hi> This is ſaid, but not proved, nor (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) probable. For very unlikely it is, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being now in a full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of his great Office of Mediator, ſhould wave his Intereſt in Heaven by means hereof, in his addreſſements unto God for Men, and pray only in the capacity, and according to the intereſt and duty, of a private Man. This would argue that He Prayd not for them with His whole heart, nor with an effectualneſſe of deſire to obtaine what He Prayed for. But let it be granted, yet ſtill it follows, that whatſoever <hi>Chriſt</hi> Prayed, for, was not ſimply or abſolutely granted, or done. And if whatſoever <hi>Chriſt</hi> Prayed for, was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely granted, it is not materiall, as to matter of impetration, whether He Prayed as Mediator, or as a private Man. But the intent of <hi>Christs</hi> Prayer for thoſe who Crucified him, was not that all their ſins ſhould be <hi>Forgiven</hi> them, much leſſe that ſimply and abſolutely, [<hi>i. e.</hi> without any interveening of Faith or Repentance] they ſhould be <hi>Forgiven</hi> (which had been to pray for that, which is expreſly contrary to the Revealed Will of God) but that that particular ſin of their Crucifying him, ſhould be <hi>Forgiven</hi> them, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhould not be imputed unto them, by way of bar to their Repentance, either by any ſuddaine or ſpeedy deſtruction, or by a delivering them up to ſuch a ſpirit of obſtinacy, or obduration, under which Men ſeldome or never repent: which was alſo the ſence of <hi>Stephens</hi> prayer for thoſe who ſtoned him: <gap reason="foreign">

               <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 7. 60.</note>. So from <hi>Chriſts</hi> Prayer for all thoſe that ſhould believe in him, <hi>that they might all be one, as the Father and He were one, and as the Father, was in Him, and He, in the Father</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Joh. 17. 21, 22.</note>, it cannot be concluded, that therefore there ſhould never fall out any difference in judgement, any diſ-union in affection between the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94900:142"/> Saints, becauſe there is neither between him, and the Father; the intent of this Prayer being only this, that God would vouchſafe gracious and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full means unto them, as well for the uniting of them in judgement, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; not that he would neceſſitate or compell them into either of theſe unions, either by ſuch means, or without. So againe, when he Prayeth to the Father to <hi>keepe</hi> his Diſciples <hi>from evill</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 17. 15.</note>, it cannot be gathered, that therefore they never ſinned, or never did that which was <hi>evill:</hi> or if it be to be underſtood of the <hi>evill</hi> of ſuffering, (as ſome conceive,) that they never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.

               <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 11. 42.</note>, I anſwer that the cleer ſence of theſe words is, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew, and doubted not, but that God the Father, perfectly knowing the ſecret of his heart and ſoul in every Prayer that he made unto him, had formerly, and would ſtill accordingly anſwer him, and gratifie him in every thing according to the true intention of his Prayer. He knew, that what he prayed for abſoutely, God the Father would abſolutely grant, and doe: and what he prayed for with, or under a reſerve, exception, or condition, that he would grant and doe, where, and as far, as ſuch a reſerve, exception, or condition, did not take place and interpoſe. Whenſoever he prayed for the Fathers concurrence with him to work Miracles for the confirmation of his Doctrine, he prayed abſolutely, and conſequently, was heard abſolutely, the matter and letter of his Prayer was never denied unto him in ſuch caſes: but when he prayed that the Cup, which he afterwards <hi>drank,</hi> might paſſe by him without his <hi>drinking it,</hi> though he prayed thrice, and that very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly (as the Text ſaith,) yet becauſe he prayed this Prayer with a Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, deſiring what he prayed for, only conditionally, and with ſubmiſſion to his Fathers Will, and the great exigency of Mankinde, theſe ſtanding in oppoſition to what he prayed for, it was not granted unto him. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is that <hi>Chriſt</hi> never prayed for, the abſolute Perſeverance of Believers in their Faith: yea it is no wayes likely, that he would have prayed for it, as he did, (I mean, with ſo much ſeriouſneſſe and affectionateneſſe of ſpirit) if God had abſolutely Decreed the giving of it unto them, whether he had prayed for it, or no. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, concerning His praying for <hi>Peter,</hi> that his <hi>Faith might</hi> not faile (which is all the ſtrength of the minor propoſition) I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That from hence it apparantly followeth, that therefore <hi>Peters</hi> Faith<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> was in danger of failing, or might have <hi>failed,</hi> had not <hi>Christ</hi> interceded for him: and conſequently that God had not abſolutely decreed the Perſeverance, or <hi>non-failing</hi> of <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, or of the Faith of any other Man. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, what efficacy can we aſcribe to the Prayer of <hi>Christ</hi> for <hi>Peters</hi> Faith? Or how can it be known upon what account <hi>Peters</hi> Faith was preſerved; whether that of <hi>Christs</hi> Prayer, or that of Gods Decree, for the non-<hi>failing</hi> of it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither can it be proved, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Prayed that <hi>Peters</hi> Faith might never <hi>faile</hi> totally, but only (if ſo much) that it might not <hi>faile</hi> upon that particular and ſore rentation, which He knew would ſoone after come upon Him. It is evident from the Context that this was all (if not more then all) that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Prayed for on the behalf of <hi>Peters</hi> Faith. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee that thy Faith faile not; and when thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 22. 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 32.</note>. Now then to infer from <hi>Christs</hi> Prayer
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94900:142"/> that <hi>Peters</hi> Faith might not <hi>faile,</hi> by, or under, a particular temptation, that therefore it could, or ſhould, never <hi>faile,</hi> is a ſtraine of no better Logique, then it would be to conclude, that thoſe who were with <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſhip, never died, becauſe God made a Promiſe unto <hi>Paul,</hi> that He would give their lives unto Him <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 27. 24.</note>, [as for that Voyage.]</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it be by the vertue and efficacy of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Prayer for <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, that the Faith of true Believers can never <hi>faile,</hi> then was the Faith of all true Believers before this Prayer made by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> obnoxious unto a <hi>failing.</hi> If this, then neither was there, nor is there, any peremptory Decree of God concerning the non-<hi>failing</hi> of the Faith of Believers. If ſo, then is there a poſſibility that their Faith may <hi>faile.</hi> For whatſoever is poſſible in reſpect of the nature of the thing, and of ſecond cauſes ſufficient to produce it, may very poſſibly come to paſſe, where no Decree of God to the contrary obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the poſſibility. Now our adverſaries themſelves acknowledge, that the Faith of true Believers, is in it ſelf, <hi>faileable,</hi> and in reſpect of ſeverall cauſes deſtructive to it, might periſh.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor is it ſo cleer from the tenor of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Prayer (intimated by him)<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> that He prayed againſt the totall <hi>failing of Peters Faith</hi> under the ſaid temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, much leſſe againſt the finall <hi>failing</hi> of it afterwards; but moſt likely it is, that what He Prayed for, was only this, that <hi>Peters</hi> yeelding to the tentation, or his being overcome by it might not extinguiſh his Faith upon any ſuch terms, but that he might, and ſhould, eft-ſoones recover it by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. If this were that, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> Prayed for on His behalf, then might His Faith <hi>faile totally</hi> under the temptation, (as <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> amongſt the Fathers, conceiveth that it did) notwithſtanding <hi>Chriſts</hi> Prayer, though not <hi>finally.</hi> And that <hi>Peters</hi> Faith did indeed faile <hi>totally</hi> by the force of the temptation, ſeemes very probable (at leaſt) from thoſe words of <hi>Christ</hi> to Him; <hi>when thou art</hi> CONVERTED, <hi>ſtrengthen,</hi> &amp;c. Men are not ſaid to be CONVERTED <hi>a gradu ad gradum, ſed a ſpecie ad ſpeciem;</hi> i. e. from a leſſer degree of Faith to a greater, but from unbelief unto Faith. And beſides, that <hi>Peter,</hi> upon His deniall of <hi>Christ,</hi> was, untill His Repentance, in the ſtate and condition of thoſe, who ſhall be denied by <hi>Christ</hi> at the great day (which could not be under any degree of true Faith remaining in Him) is evident from that generall and expreſſe intermination of <hi>Chriſt, Mat. 10. 33. Whoſoever ſhall deny Me before Men, Him will I alſo deny before My Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. (And laſtly) whatſoever the intent or ſubject matter of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Prayer for <hi>Peter,</hi> was, evident it is, that as His temptation, with an eye where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto this Prayer was made for Him by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was ſingular and particular, ſo was <hi>Chriſts</hi> Prayer alſo for Him. And a Man may as well from <hi>Peters</hi> temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, argue, that all true Believers ſhall be tempted after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to the ſame degree; as from <hi>Chriſts</hi> Prayer for <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>His Faith might not faile,</hi> conclude, that the Faith of no true Believer ſhall <hi>faile.</hi> So likewiſe from <hi>Chriſts looking back</hi> upon <hi>Peter,</hi> to provoke Him the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to Repentance, as good an argument, as that now under Conteſt, may be framed, to prove, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will viſibly look upon all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, when they ſin, to provoke them to Repentance. It is in the caſe of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Prayer, as it is of His Precepts. When He commands any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a particular occaſion, or ground, the obliging force of the command is to be extended no further, then where the ſame, or like occaſion and ground take place. And intimation hath been given formerly, that the Apoſtles,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94900:143"/> in reſpect of that great and extraordinary ſervice of carrying the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> up and down the World, ſo full of enmity and oppoſition to it, had many prerogative favours vouchſafed unto them by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wherein the generality of Believers, having no ſuch ingagement lying upon them, have no ground or reaſon to expect an equality, or ſhare with them. Therefore there is nothing of any value in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Praying for <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, to ſupport the falling cauſe of the common Doctrine of Perſeverance.</p>
            <p>A fifth Argument advanced in defence of the ſame Doctrine, is drawn from<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> the Interceſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the Right Hand of God for His Saints. <hi>Who is He that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen againe, who is even at the Right Hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſsion for us. Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom: 8. 34, 35.</note> &amp;c. So againe: <hi>Chriſt is entered into Heaven it ſelf to appeare in the preſence of God for us</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 9. 24.</note>: and, <hi>ſince he ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to make interceſsion for them</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note>. From hence it is thus argued: If thoſe for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> intercedes at the Right Hand of God, may fall away from their Faith, ſo as to periſh notwithſtanding, then is the interceſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall, and inſufficient to preſerve them. But the Interceſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not ineffectuall, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi> To this I anſwer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is no where affirmed that <hi>Chriſt</hi> intercedes for the Perſeverance of the Saints in their Faith, or, that they who once believe, ſhould never ceaſe believing, how ſinfull and wicked ſoever they ſhall prove afterwards. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> intercedes for His Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> as ſuch, and as continuing ſuch, that no accuſations from any hand whatſoever, may be heard againſt them, that no afflictions or ſufferings which they meet with in the World, may cauſe any alienation, or abatement, in the Love of God towards them, but that God will preſerve and protect them under them, &amp;c. and conſequently, that they may be maintained at an excellent rate of conſolation, in every eſtate and condition, and againſt all interpoſures of any Creature whatſoever to the contrary. This to be the tenor and effect of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Interceſſion for His Saints, is evident from the firſt of the three paſſages cited. And for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt,</hi> it is not meant of <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating us</hi> from that <hi>love,</hi> wherewith we love <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but from that <hi>love,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Chriſt</hi> loveth us, <hi>viz.</hi> as we are Saints, and <hi>abide in His love</hi> by <hi>keeping His Commandements</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 10.</note>. Neither is it to be ſo conceived, as if ſin, wickedneſſe, looſeneſſe, prophaneneſſe, &amp;c. could not un-Saint Men, and hereby <hi>ſeperate</hi> them <hi>from the love,</hi> wherewith <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſometimes loved them; (for that ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity will ſeparate between Men, and their God, is evident from <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59. 2.) but the cleer meaning is, that nothing, no Creature whatſoever, perſon, or thing, can make <hi>Chriſt</hi> an enemy unto thoſe, who ſhall in Faith and Love cleave faſt unto Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Were it granted, that part of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Interceſſion for his Saints, is, that their Faith may never faile, yet the meaning hereof would not neceſſarily, nor indeed with any competent probability, be this, that no ſin or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whatſoever that ſhall, or can, be perpetrated by them, might cauſe them to make ſhipwrack of their Faith; but rather that God would graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly vouchſafe ſuch means, and ſuch a preſence of His Spirit unto them, whereby they may be richly inabled to keepe themſelves in Faith and a good Conſcience unto the end. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſimply and abſolutely intercede that no ſin or wickedneſſe whatſoever may deſtroy the Faith of any true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and conſequently, deprive Him of Salvation, ſhould He not hereby become that, which the Apoſtle rejects with indignation, as altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:94900:143"/> of Him; I mean, <hi>a Miniſter of ſin? Is therefore Chriſt the Miniſter of ſin? God forbid</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 2. 17.</note>. Or whereby, or wherein can it lightly be imagined, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould become <hi>a Miniſter of ſin,</hi> rather then by interceding with His Father, that ſuch and ſuch Men, how vile and abominable ſoever they ſhall become, may yet be precious in His ſight, and receive <hi>a Crown of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> from His Hand? Or doth not ſuch an interceſſion, as ſome Men put upon Him, as <hi>viz.</hi> they, who make Him to intercede ſimply and abſolutely for the Perſeverance of Believers in their Faith, amount to an Interceſſion of every whit as vile and unworthy an import, as this?</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the Men I ſpeak of, doe not make <hi>Chriſt</hi> an Interceſſor<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> for the non-failing of the Faith of His Saints, upon ſuch terms as I pretend, as, <hi>viz.</hi> that their Faith may not faile, how wicked or abominable ſoever they ſhall be; but thus, that God will preſerve them from ſuch wicked and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable wayes and practiſes, which, ſhould they fall into them, would be the ruine of their faith, and that he would effectually direct, and perſwade them into the uſe of ſuch means, which thorough His grace and bleſſing on them, ſhall preſerve them, at leaſt from a totall and finall declining; To this I Anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. If this be aſſerted for the tenor of <hi>Chriſts</hi> interceſſion for His Saints, that God will Preſerve them from ſuch ſins, which would be the bane and ruine of their Faith, ſhould they fall into them, the aſſertors render the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> every whit as invalid and ineffectuall, as they pretend ſuch Men do, who deny the neceſſity of the Saints Perſeverance, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſts</hi> interceding for them. For evident it is that the Saints are not preſerved by God (at leaſt in their ſence of preſerving) from ſuch ſins as theſe, unleſſe we ſhall ſay that murther, inceſt, drunkenneſſe, adultery; diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, denying of Chriſt, &amp;c. are none of theſe ſins. For that the Saints of God did fall into ſuch ſins as theſe, is notoriouſly known from the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that though <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not intercede that His Saints ſhould<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> ſimply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and abſolutely be preſerved from ſuch ſins, yet He intercedes, that in caſe they fall ſometimes into them, they may not be wholly overcome by them; or continue in them, ſo as not to recover themſelves any more, &amp;c. I Anſwer;</p>
            <p>If ſo, then Chriſt doth not intercede for the preſerving of His Saints from ſin, ſimply, no nor from the greateſt or fouleſt of ſin, ſimply, but only ſo far, as they are wholly and abſolutely inconſiſtent with their Salvation. Here, 1. I would willingly know, from what quarter of the Scriptures, the leaſt or gentleſt aire of ſuch a Doctrine, or conceit as this, breatheth: or where the interceſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the Saints is thus ſtated, or taught, by the Holy Ghoſt. 2. The purport, end, and intent of the interceſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the Saints, is the ſame with thoſe of His death for them: only the Scripture placeth, though not more vertue, yet a clearer ground of hope or confidence unto the Saints, for their obtaining the ſame ends and bleſſings, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for them, then in His death. This is cleer from the place lately cited: <hi>who is He that condemneth? it is Christ that Died, yea rather that is riſen againe, who is even at the right Hand of God, who alſo maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſsion for us</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 34.</note>. In which tenor of words He plainly buildeth one and the ſame hope, or conſolation to the Saints, upon all theſe foure grounds, the Death of Chriſt, His Reſurrection, His ſitting, or being at the right Hand of God, His making interceſſion for them; only with this difference, that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:94900:144"/> he placeth more pregnancy of ſtrength to beare or to exhibit, the conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in every latter of theſe grounds reſpectively, then in the former. Now certaine it is, that the adequate end or intent of <hi>Christ</hi> dying for His Saints, as to the matter of Sanctification, was not to redeeme or preſerve them only from high miſdemeanors in ſinning, and ſuch as are incompatible with their Salvation, but from all, and all manner of ſin whatſoever. <hi>Who gave Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that He might redeeme us from</hi> all <hi>iniquity, and purifie to Himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good works</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Tit. 2. 14:</note>. See alſo 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1 18. 19. with many other places. Thus then we cleerly ſee, that <hi>Christs</hi> Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion no wayes mediates in the behalf of the common Doctrine of Perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. However,</p>
            <p>A ſixth Argument for the confirmation of it, is this: whatſoever true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> aske, or pray for, unto the Father in <hi>Christs</hi> Name, eſpecially being neceſſary unto Salvation, that they certainly and alwayes, obtaine. <hi>Joh. 16. 23. 1 Ioh.</hi> 5. 14. But they daily pray for conſtancy or perſeverance in true Faith, as <hi>viz.</hi> when they pray unto God, that He would <hi>not lead them into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but deliver them from evill</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 6. 13.</note>. Therefore certainly they obtaine perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Him. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This whole Argument might be granted, both without any prejudice to the Doctrine which we maintain, as alſo without advantage to that Doctrine, which it undertakes to protect. For the queſtion is not, whether the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance of the Saints be a thing poſſible, or whether it may not be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a diligent uſe of means, ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s frequent or dayly Prayer unto God in Faith, is: but whether there be not a poſſibility that the Saints may neglect the uſe of ſuch means, which are neceſſary and proper for the obtaining, or maintaining of it. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the minor propoſition ſaith, that <hi>true Believers dayly pray for Perſeverance,</hi> &amp;c. it doth (in effect) aſſert that which is queſtionable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the controverters, for a proof of it ſelf, and ſo is guilty of that infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in arguing, which Logicians call <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> a begging of the qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtion. For to ſay, that the Saints daily pray in Faith unto God for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, &amp;c. is, being interpreted, to ſay, that they will perſevere. So that this propoſition is every whit as doubtfull, as the concluſion it ſelf: and a ſubſtantiall proof of it is deſired. And though this could be ſufficiently proved, yet</p>
            <p n="3">3. The major propoſition it ſelf, in thoſe generall terms, wherein it is propounded, is no propoſition of Faith. For it is not ſufficient, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of what they aske, that the Saints ſhould ſimply pray in the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> or in Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a confidence of receiving what they ask, but further, that they ask, or pray, <hi>according to his Will. And this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that we have in him, that if we aske any thing</hi> ACCORDING TO HIS WILL, <hi>he heareth us</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 14.</note>. So that the frequent praying of the Saints for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, though in the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> and in Faith, is no competent proof that they ſhall certainly obtaine it, (<hi>i. e.</hi> how wickedly or abominably ſoever they ſhall live) untill it be firſt proved, that it is <hi>according to the Will of God,</hi> that they ſhould pray for it upon ſuch Terms.</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) if both the propoſitions were granted, yet would the concluſion follow upon none other terms, then perfection in this life is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this Argument of the Perfectioniſts. Whatſoever true Believers pray for <hi>according to the Will of God,</hi> that they ſhall certainly obtaine, according to the Promiſes, <hi>Joh. 16. 23. 1 Ioh.</hi> 5. 14. But the Saints, <hi>according to the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:94900:144"/> Will of God,</hi> and in order to his glory, pray, <hi>that his Will</hi> may be <hi>done on Earth, as it is in Heaven, i. e.</hi> perfectly (for ſo it is <hi>done</hi> in Heaven.) Therefore His Will is done perfectly on Earth: and conſequently perfection is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attained in this life. Let the <hi>Perſeveriſts</hi> anſwer this Argument of the <hi>Perfectionists,</hi> and they will be able to anſwer their own.</p>
            <p>A ſeventh Argument upon the former account, is this: They who ſhall<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> certainly and faithfully be preſerved and kept by <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto the end, ſhall never, either totally, or finally, miſcarry, or fall away. But all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are, and ſhall be, thus kept by <hi>Chriſt. Ergo.</hi> The Minor is proved by theſe Texts of Scripture, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 37. &amp; <hi>Verſe 39. Ioh. 10. 27, 28. Joh. 17. 12. Ioh. 13. 1. 1 Cor. 1. 8. Eph. 5. 23. Iude. Ver. 1. 2 Tim. 1. 12. Heb. 12. 2. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 5. I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the ſtrength and ſubſtance of this Argument hath received anſwer in full already, where we opened at large ſeverall of the principall Texts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon for the proof of the aſſumption: whereof we ſhall give notice preſently. Yet,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We anſwer, that the concluſion it ſelf, <hi>That all true Believers ſhall never miſcarry, or fall away,</hi> rightly underſtood, oppoſeth not our ſence in the preſent controverſie. We firmly hold and believe, that no true Believer ſhall fall away [from the grace of God,] or miſcarry [in point of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,] and that all, who either doe thus fall away, or miſcarry, are no true Believers, but wicked Apoſtates, at the time of their falling away, or miſcarrying. But this (we preſume) ſatisfies not the Argumentators. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. If theſe words, <hi>ſhall certainly and faithfully be preſerved and kept by Chriſt unto the end,</hi> import no other <hi>preſervation</hi> or <hi>keeping</hi> by him, but what is meant in, and can be proved from, the Texts ſpecified for proof of the Minor propoſition, the Major is denied: <hi>They who are preſerved, and kept by Chriſt,</hi> in ſuch a ſence, as the Scriptures affirme Men to be preſerved and kept by Him, may poſſibly miſcarry, or fall away, both totally, and finally from their Faith; <hi>viz.</hi> in caſe themſelves ſhall not comport with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in His act of preſerving or keeping them, with their diligence and care to preſerve themſelves. Nor doe any of the Scriptures cited prove the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; no nor yet that thoſe that are preſerved by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt, by any compulſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or neceſſitating power, joyn with him their care and diligence in preſerving themſelves. Let us take a brief ſurvey of ſuch of the particulars, which have not been taken off already from the ingagement.</p>
            <p>The firſt place, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 37. affirmeth, <hi>that Christ will in no wiſe cast out</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 37.</note> 
               <hi>him that commeth unto him,</hi> or, that is comming unto Him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But this proveth not, but that he that is on his way towards <hi>Christ,</hi> may go back before he comes fully to Him; nor that he that is fully come to Him, is under no poſſibility of departing from him. It only proveth, that there is not the leaſt diſpoſition or inclination in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to diſcourage any Man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever from coming to him, nor to deny entertainment or acceptance, to whoſoever ſhall come to him, and whileſt he ſhall be willing to ſtay, or abide with Him. And elſewhere he perſwades and exhorts thoſe, that are <hi>come</hi> to Him, to <hi>abide in him,</hi> or with him, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 4. and threatens thoſe who ſhall not <hi>abide</hi> with him. <hi>Ioh. 15. 4. 6. Heb.</hi> 10. 38. both which evidently ſuppoſe a poſſibility of their departure from Him, who at preſent are with him.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>Ver.</hi> 39. he expreſſeth himſelf thus: <hi>And this is the Fathers will,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94900:145"/> that hath ſent Me, that of all which He hath given Me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up againe at the laſt day,</hi> it is evident that He ſpeaketh not of loſing Believers by defection from Faith, but by Death. And to aſſure all Believers of this, He declares that it is His Fathers Will and Pleaſure, that He ſhould raiſe them all up [all, that ſhould die Believers] unto a bleſſed eſtate and condition of life, <hi>at the laſt Day.</hi> Beſides, if the place ſhould be meant of <hi>loſing</hi> by defection from Faith, the <hi>loſing</hi> of ſuch, who ſhould be <hi>loſt</hi> this way, could not be imputed to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who fulfils His Fathers Will and Pleaſure to the uttermoſt for their preſervation, but to themſelves, who withdraw themſelves from His cuſtody.</p>
            <p>Concerning the third place, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 27. 28. we ſpake largely in the next preceding Chapter, <hi>Sect.</hi> 37. &amp;c. where we ſhewed in what ſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſpeaking of His <hi>Sheep,</hi> ſaith that <hi>no Man ſhould pluck them out of His Hand.</hi> The next place, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 12. preſenteth us with theſe words from <hi>Chriſt</hi> in His Prayer to the Father; <hi>Thoſe that thou gaveſt Me, I have kept, and none of them is loſt.</hi> But neither can it be inferred from hence, either that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo <hi>keepeth</hi> all true Believers, that none of them at any time periſheth, or is loſt; much leſſe that He ſo keepeth them, that there is no poſſibility that any of them ſhould ever be loſt; no nor yet that He had kept His Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (of whom it is a plaine caſe that He ſpeaks particularly in the place) ſo, or upon any ſuch terms of keeping, that there was no poſſibility that any of them, ſhould be <hi>loſt,</hi> or periſh; but only that He had ſo kept them, that none of them was loſt; excepting only <hi>the Son of perdition</hi> (as it immediatly follows) who was not loſt neither for lack of good and ſufficient keeping, (wherein doubtleſſe He did partake with his fellowes) but through the great malignity or wretchedneſſe of his own will, his good keeping notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. So that neither can hence any thing be gathered to prove any ſuch preſervation of the Saints by <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but that they may nevertheleſſe decline, both totally, and finally.</p>
            <p>The two next places, <hi>viz. Ioh.</hi> 13. 1. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8. upon former examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> have been found ſtrangers to that cauſe, which they are here brought to plead. The former, <hi>cap. 10. Sect.</hi> 38. The latter, in the ſame <hi>Chap. Sect.</hi> 20. &amp; <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. of this preſent Chapter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> next to theſe, is <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 23. where <hi>Chriſt</hi> (according to the more generall ſence of Interpreters; for ſome underſtand it, not of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but of the Husband) is termed, <hi>the Saviour of His Body.</hi> But neither doth this expreſſion import any ſuch preſervation of the body, or Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by Him, which ſuppoſeth an impoſſibility of the defection of any one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from it. For (to follow the ducture of the Parable, or Similitude here uſed by the Apoſtle) the Husband is the conſervator or keeper of his wife: yet notwithſtanding the wife may poſſibly miſcarry, and break the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Covenant, yea, though the Husband acts his part upon the beſt and moſt commendable terms, for the preſerving of her from that folly, that may be. The reaſon is, becauſe the wife, being a reaſonable Creature, is to be dealt with, in order to her preſervation or keeping in that kinde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, as <hi>viz.</hi> by rationall arguments or motives only, as by an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary, loving, and prudent carriage in the Husband towards her, by Seaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtructions, gentle admonitions upon occaſion, &amp;c. not by keeping her under Lock and Key as in a Priſon, where no Man may come neer her, nor by any compulſory or violent means, in one kinde or other. All ſuch wayes of ſecuring her from ſolly, as theſe, would ill become the Husband,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:94900:145"/> and be very unacceptable to the Wife, whether vertuouſly, or viciouſly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. In like manner <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Saviour of His Spouſe, the Church, and not only of the Church in generall, but of every member thereof: but He executes and performes the intereſt or office of a Saviour, by wayes and means meet to be exerciſed towards, and about, ſuch a Body, and ſuch Members, for their preſervation (if we ſpeak of their preſervation from ſin) as <hi>viz.</hi> by inward motions and excitements of His Spirit, unto well doing, and to a continuance therein, by vouchſafing the Miniſtry of His Word, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and converſe of his Saints, many providentiall opportunities, apt and proper to prevaile with a rationall Creature, to minde the things of God, and of its own Peace, &amp;c. but not by any neceſſitating adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or applications of Himſelf whatſoever. So that though <hi>Chriſt</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the office of a Saviour towards His Body, upon the moſt faithfull, carefull, and honorable terms, that can be imagined, yet there muſt needs be a poſſibility at leaſt left, for any Member thereof to miſcarry. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I rather conceive that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is here called, <hi>the Saviour of His Body,</hi> in reſpect of that protection, which He affords unto it, and to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Member of it, as ſuch, and whileſt it continues ſuch; or rather in reſpect of that great Salvation and Deliverance from Death, and Hell, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of penall evills, which He hath purchaſed for it with His Blood, and with which He will actually inveſt the members of it in due time. But this doth not prove, that every preſent Member of His Body, though it corrupts, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifies, and falls off from it, ſhould nevertheleſſe partake in Priviledges with the ſound: nor yet that every Member, ſound at preſent, will never hereafter putrifie or corrupt. Nor is it any whit more diſhonour, or diſparagement unto <hi>Christ,</hi> to have ſuch Members relating to His Body, which are capable of ſpirituall, then which are liable to corporall, putrifaction. He that vouchſafeth to be the Head of a Body conſiſting, either in whole, or in part, of fleſh and blood, in, and by, this very act of grace, condeſcendeth to be an head of ſuch Members, which are very capable of ſinning, and therefore not unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſmembring themſelves through ſin.</p>
            <p>To that of <hi>Iude,</hi> Verſe 1. <hi>to them that are ſanctified by God the Father, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 39.</note> 
               <hi>preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt, and called,</hi> I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not denied, but that <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth preſerve His Saints, and that with much care and tenderneſſe, yea and watcheth over them for good: The queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, whether by His preſerving them, He impoſeth an unconquerable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon them of perſevering in Faith unto the end. The ſimple preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints by <hi>Christ,</hi> is all that can be concluded from this Scripture: the manner of it, or the terms, on which it is performed, are not at all ſo much as intimated here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Participle, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>preſerved,</hi> being of the Preterperfect-tenſe, imports only that the Perſons to whom he ſpeaks, had been [<hi>viz.</hi> hitherto] <hi>preſerved,</hi> or kept, by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> or, for <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> (for ſo the words will beare) not that He intended, whatſoever their after-miſdemeanors in ſin ſhould be, to <hi>preſerve</hi> them in Faith unto the end. Here is no Word, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Letter, or Iota, of any ſuch thing as this. And if His intent had been to informe them, that they were ſo <hi>kept by Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that there was no danger or poſſibility for them finally to miſcarry, He had laid a very ſlippery and incongruous foundation to build that ſerious exhortation upon, wherein He addreſſeth Himſelf unto them, <hi>Verſe 3. viz. to contend earneſtly for the Faith.</hi> For what need they <hi>contend earneſtly for the Faith,</hi> who have aſſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:94900:146"/> from God, that they ſhall be preſerved in the Faith, whether they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for it,</hi> or no? And if they were, againſt all poſſible interveniencies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to be preſerved by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Faith, to what purpoſe, or with what co-herence of diſcourſe, doth He re-mind them of the example of Gods Severity upon many unbelieving <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> even <hi>after</hi> he had delivered them <hi>out of the Land of Egypt;</hi> as likewiſe upon thoſe <hi>Angels, who kept not their firſt ſtandings? Verſe</hi> 5. 6. The very propoſall of ſuch examples unto them, as theſe, plainly enough ſuppoſeth, that they alſo were liable to ſuffer the ſame ſeverity from God, upon the like terms.</p>
            <p>The next place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. acquaints us with the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit, as<note place="margin">§. 40.</note> far as theſe words will extend: <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him, againſt that day.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
            <p>That this place of all the reſt is eccentricall to the buſineſſe in hand. For it ſpeaks only of the Power of God to <hi>keep;</hi> whereas this never came within the verge of the queſtion. Or if the Will of God to <hi>keep,</hi> be here included, or ſuppoſed alſo; neither was it ever queſtioned by me, whether God be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to keep His Saints, or no. That which I oppoſe, is that manner, which ſome obtrude; affirming, that God <hi>preſerves</hi> his Saints upon ſuch terms, after ſuch a manner, that he peremptorily hereby neceſſitates their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. Certaine I am that the Scripture in hand gives no ſuch ſound as this. Beſides, that <hi>depoſitum,</hi> or thing <hi>committed</hi> by him unto God, which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, was not his Faith (this can in no very tolerable ſence be ſaid to be committed unto God) but rather his Soul, which he <hi>committed</hi> to the care and ſafe-keeping of God. Nor is there the leaſt doubt or queſtion to be made, but that God was both <hi>able,</hi> and willing, to keep this ſafe, as long as the Apoſtle was deſirous and willing to intruſt him with it, and to ſuffer it to lie in his hand. But this proveth not, but that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle himſelf was at liberty, to have recalled, or taken back this his <hi>depoſitum</hi> out of the hand of God: in which caſe he had been diſcharged from taking fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care of it.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>Heb. 12. 2. Chriſt is ſtiled the Author and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi>

               </gap> the Particle, <hi>ours,</hi> is not in the <hi>Greek</hi>] it doth not imply any acting of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in, about, or upon, our <hi>Faith,</hi> in a Phyſicall way, or with any efficiency (properly ſo called) much leſſe with any neceſſitating efficiency; but that he was an abſolute or perfect Captaine, or Leader, in that way of <hi>Faith,</hi> wherein we all ſtand bound to follow him at the perill of our Souls; He was diſmayed, diſcouraged, danted at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which he was called to ſuffer or indure, in his courſe; but with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and unconquerable ſpirit of Faith, held on his way through the midſt of thoſe threatnings and devouring afflictions, which incountred him, untill he came where glory and bleſſedneſſe waited for him, and attended his comming. This to be the ſence and meaning of the ſaid words, the carriage of the Context round about doth perfectly manifeſt: we ſhall not need to argue for it. So that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">

And ſo, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Perfecter of Faith,</hi> not becauſe he actually
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94900:146"/> conſummates, or <hi>perfecteth,</hi> the work, or grace of Faith in his Saints (for this work is never brought to <hi>perfection</hi> in them, in this life; and though it be, in a ſence <hi>perfected,</hi> in the life to come, yet this perfection is <hi>extra ſpeciem, i. e.</hi> not by adding degrees to it of the ſame kinde, but by a tranſmutation of it into viſion;) but becauſe by his moſt noble example he taught Men the very <hi>perfection</hi> of Faith, or believing; which conſiſts, in a quiet, patient, and contentfull ſuffering of all manner of Tentations and Tribulations, which a Man is called to ſuffer in the World, and the ſuffering whereof he cannot decline without ſin, out of ſetled and firme belief of receiving that incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Crowne of bleſſedneſſe and glory in the end of his Race, which God hath promiſed unto all thoſe that are <hi>faithfull unto Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the laſt of the Texts cited in favour of the argument in hand, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5.) plenty of light hath bin already given <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 10. Sect. 18.</note>; whereby it fully appeares, that it holds no correſpondency at all with the opinion, or Doctrine, which pretends unto it in the argument.</p>
            <p>A further argument advanced by ſome to promote the common Doctrine<note place="margin">§. 42.</note> of Perſeverance (uncapable of Preferment) is this. They who are ſealed in their hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, that they ſhall certainly be ſaved, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther totally, nor finally, loſe their Faith: But all true Believers are thus ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they cannot but Perſevere, without any either totall, or finall, amiſſion of their Faith. For the proofe of the Minor, theſe Scriptures are produced, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 21. Eph. 1. 13. 14. Eph.</hi> 4. 30. which all ſpeake of the Obſignation of Believers by the Spirit of God. To this alſo we Anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. By diſtinguiſhing the Major Propoſition, thus: <hi>They who are ſealed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that they ſhall certainly be ſaved, &amp;c. [viz.</hi> with ſuch a ſealing, which is unchangeable or irreverſible, by any interveniencies whatſoever, as of ſin, wickedneſſe, apoſtaſie, &amp;c.] <hi>cannot loſe their Faith.</hi> But if the <hi>ſealing</hi> be only ſuch, the continuance whereof depends upon the continuance of the Faith of the <hi>ſealed,</hi> and conſequently, may be reverſed, or withdrawn, it no wayes proves that all they, who are partakers of it, muſt of neceſſity retaine their Faith, without all poſſibility of any either totall, or finall, miſcarriage of it. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We anſwer further, that <hi>the ſealing with the ſpirit,</hi> ſpoken of in the Scriptures ſpecified, is the latter kinde of ſealing, not the former, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch a <hi>ſealing,</hi> which depends upon the Faith of thoſe that are <hi>ſealed,</hi> as in the beginning or firſt impreſſion of it, ſo in the duration or continuance of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and conſequently, hath none other certainty of its continuance, but only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the ſaid Faith, which (as we have already proved in part, and ſhall, God willing, further prove, ere long) being uncertaine, the <hi>ſealing</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on it, muſt needs be uncertaine alſo, and reverſible. That the <hi>ſealing</hi> proveable from the Scriptures mentioned, depends upon the Faith of the <hi>ſealed,</hi> is evident by the tenor of one, and by the Contexts, and plaine circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances relating to them all. <hi>In whom alſo</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13.) AFTER <hi>that yee</hi> BELIEVED, <hi>yee were ſealed with the ſpirit of Promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can it reaſonably be here objected, that this indeed proves the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the <hi>ſealing</hi> ſpoken of, upon the Faith of the ſealed, in the firſt act, or impreſſion, but not in the duration of it; for the anſwer hereunto is plain; <hi>viz.</hi> that if it depends upon it in reſpect of the beginning, or firſt act of it, much more doth it thus depend in reſpect of the perpetuation of it. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe he that hath once believed, and afterwards ſhall make ſhipwrack
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:94900:147"/> of his Faith, is far more uncapable of this grace of <hi>ſealing,</hi> then he was, before his believing.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that Believers are ſaid to be <hi>ſealed by the Holy Spirit of</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 43.</note> 
               <hi>God against the day of Redemption</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note>, and God is ſaid <hi>to give them the earneſt of the Spirit in their hearts</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 22.</note>; which gift of the Spirit, is likewiſe ſaid to be <hi>the earneſt of their inheritance, untill the Redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſsion</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 1 14.</note>. (<hi>i. e.</hi> by an <hi>Hypallage,</hi> untill the poſſeſſion of the purchaſed Redemption, meaning, their full deliverance from ſin, and ſorrow) which expreſſions ſeeme to import, that the <hi>ſealing</hi> of the ſpirit once granted unto Believers, is granted upon ſuch terms, that it ſhall continue in them, and upon them, untill their Reſurrection unto life and glory; to this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By conceſſion: it is very true, the <hi>ſealing</hi> of the ſpirit granted unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is granted with an intent or purpoſe, on Gods Part, that it ſhould remaine perpetually with them. So that if there be an interruption, or cancell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, it ſhall not ariſe from any variableneſs or mutability in him, nor from any change of minde or affections in him, from what he was in both, when he firſt vouchſafed it unto them. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I anſwer further (by way of exception) that the <hi>ſealing</hi> we ſpeak of is never granted by God unto Believers themſelves, upon any ſuch terms, that upon no occaſion, or occaſions whatſoever, as of the greateſt and moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſins committed, and long continued in, by them, or the like, it ſhould never be interrupted, or defaced. For this is contrary to many plaine Texts of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and particularly unto all thoſe, where either Apoſtates from God, or evill doers and workers of iniquity, are threatened with the loſſe of Gods favour, and of the inheritance of like. Such are <hi>Heb. 10. Verſe</hi> 26, 27. and again <hi>Verſe. 38, 39. Ezek. 18. 24. Eph. 5. 5. 6. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. with many more of like import. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Believers are ſaid to be ſealed by the <hi>Holy Spirit of God againſt,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, or for, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>the day of Redemption,</hi> becauſe that Holineſſe, which is wrought in them by the Spirit of God, qualifies them, puts them into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and actuall capacity of partaking in that joy, bleſſedneſſe, and glory, which the great Day of the Plenary and full <hi>Redemption</hi> of the Saints [<hi>i. e.</hi> of thoſe who lived, and died, and ſhall then be found, ſuch] ſhall bring with it. And it is called <hi>the earneſt of their Inheritance,</hi> becauſe it is binding or obliging on Gods Part, as well in reſpect of His Promiſe, [for He Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Part and Fellowſhip in this <hi>Inheritance,</hi> unto thoſe that ſhall live holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not turne aſide into wayes of ſin] as of the nature of the thing it ſelf, being ſomewhat, for kinde and Property, of that <hi>undefiled inheritance,</hi> which He hath Promiſed unto holy Perſons, and which is reſerved for them in the Heavens. But as <hi>earneſts,</hi> given and received amongſt Men, though they be ingaging and obliging on both ſides, ſimply, and in caſe of a non-interventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of very materiall circumſtances, in order to the breaking or diſſolving of the contract ratified by them; yet are they ſeldome or never ingaging, or obliging on either ſide upon ſuch terms, that no poſſible interpoſition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Providences, or other things, can diſcharge them. A contract of marriage, ratified and confirmed by both parties, with <hi>earneſt</hi> given, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, may notwithſtanding lawfully be diſſolved upon an act of adultery committed by the one party, if the other pleaſeth. There is the ſame conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion likewiſe of confirmation by earneſts in other caſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) if the Apoſtles intent had been to informe the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that the gift of the Holy Spirit, which they had received from God, was
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94900:147"/> 
               <hi>the earneſt of their inheritance</hi> upon ſuch terms, that no unworthineſſe or wickedneſſe whatſoever on their parts, could ever hinder the actuall collation of this inheritance upon them, he had plainly prevaricated with that moſt ſerious admonition, wherein he addreſſeth Himſelf unto them afterwards. <hi>For this yee know that no Whoremonger, nor uncleane perſon, nor Covetous Man, who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the Kingdome of Chriſt, and of God. Let no Man deceive you with vaine words: for becauſe of theſe things commeth the Wrath of God upon the Children of diſobedience</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 5. 5. 6.</note>. To what purpoſe ſhould he thus ſeverely diſcipline and nurture thoſe, in order to their eſcaping the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> which would certainly <hi>come</hi> for ſuch, and ſuch, ſins upon Men, whom he had a little before aſſured that there was no danger, no poſſibility of their falling under <hi>the Wrath of God,</hi> or of their miſcarrying in Point of Salvation.</p>
            <p>A ninth Argument taught by ſome to ſpeak for the Doctrine of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,<note place="margin">§. 44.</note> hitherto oppoſed, conſiſts of ſuch <hi>Scripture</hi> ſimilitudes, wherein true Believers are reſembled to ſuch things, which ſeeme to import the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their Perſeverance. As <hi>viz. Pſal.</hi> 1. 3. they are compared to <hi>a Tree planted by the Rivers of Water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon, whoſe leafe alſo ſhall not wither, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 7. 24; 25. <hi>to a wiſe Man that built his Houſe upon a Rock,</hi> ſo that though <hi>the Raine fell, and the Floods came, and the Winds blew, and beate upon that Houſe,</hi> yet <hi>it fell not.</hi> Luk. 8. 8. <hi>to ſeede that fell upon good ground, which ſprang up, and bare fruit an hundred fold.</hi> To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the generall, that no ſimilitude whatſoever, whereby the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Safety, or Glory of the Saints or Children of God are ſet forth in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> doe any wayes reach the Point in Queſtion. Becauſe the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not whether the Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> as ſuch, and abiding ſuch, ſhall ſtand for ever in the greateſt Proſperity, Safety, and Glory: but (as hath oft, in effect, been ſaid) whether thoſe, who have been Saints at any time heretofore, muſt neceſſarily be ſuch at this day, and cannot poſsibly degenerate into any other kind, or ſort of Men for ever. The ſimilitudes produced evince no ſuch thing as this. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I anſwer in Particular, 1. That the compariſon of a Man <hi>delighting in the Law of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 1. to the <hi>Tree</hi> there deſcribed, doth not ſuppoſe, that he can never ceaſe delighting in His Law; nor is any ſuch thing as this ſignified by the non-<hi>falling of the leafe</hi> of this Tree; too too frequent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience commandeth acknowledgement on both ſides that the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or Men ſometimes <hi>delighting in the Law of the Lord,</hi> may otherwhile <hi>delight</hi> themſelves in wayes of vanity and great wickedneſſe. But the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the ſimilitude is only to ſhew, that the condition of a Perſon eſchuing evill, and obſerving the Law of God, and continuing ſuch, ſhall be ever proſperous and <hi>bleſſed.</hi> There is nothing more ordinary in <hi>Scripture,</hi> then to attribute or predict unto Men, both future Puniſhments, and Rewards, in reſpect of their preſent wayes, whether good, or evill, ſimply, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any clauſe of exception in caſe of an after change in either; whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Poſsibility of a change is cleerly ſuppoſed, and a ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on likewiſe, as well of the ſaid Puniſhments, as Rewards hereupon, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the change ſhall be. Thus wicked Men in ſeverall kinds, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, Adulterers, Idolaters, Extortioners, Drunkards, &amp;c. are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, Heb: 13. 4.</note> threatened with the loſſe of the Kingdome of Heaven, without any mention made, either of that Poſsibility they are in of Repenting after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:94900:148"/> or of any reverſall of ſuch a Puniſhment, in caſe they ſhall Repent: whereas it is a cleer caſe (from other <hi>Scriptures</hi>) that both the one and the other are ſuppoſed notwithſtanding, as <hi>viz.</hi> where forgiveneſſe of ſins is Promiſed unto ſinners of all kinds, upon Repentance. I forbeare to cite places, being ſo frequent and obvious. So God often Promiſeth life and ſalvation unto juſt and righteous Men, without mentioning that Poſsibility they are in of turning aſide from their Righteouſneſſe, or any deprivation or loſſe of Life and Salvation, they are like to ſuſtaine, in caſe they ſhall thus turne aſide; yet evident it is from other places, (of which we ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to produce many in the following Chapter) that both the one and the other are there ſuppoſed; as <hi>viz.</hi> where backſliders are threatened with the diſpleaſure of God, and deſtruction. But of this idiome of <hi>Scripture</hi> expreſsion we have taken knowledge formerly, and that more then once. See Sect. 9. of this Chapter. And that by the Man <hi>delighting in the Law of God,</hi> compared unto <hi>a Tree planted,</hi> &amp;c. (in the Paſſage in hand) is meant not ſimply that Man thus <hi>delighting,</hi> at preſent, but ſuch a Man, who ſhould conſtantly and with Perſeverance thus <hi>delight,</hi> is evident from the antitheſis which the Pſalme maketh between him, and the wicked Man, who is deſcribed as perſeveringly wicked unto the end. <hi>Therefore the wicked ſhall not stand in the judgement, Verſ.</hi> 5. and againe: <hi>and the way of the wicked ſhall periſh, Verſ.</hi> 6. which expreſſions cleerly ſhew, that by the <hi>Sinner,</hi> or wicked Man, here oppoſed to the godly, is not meant, ſimply ſuch a Perſon, who at preſent is wicked, or a ſinner, but who ſhall continue ſuch without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto his end.</p>
            <p>2. There is the ſame conſideration of the ſecond compariſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 25. By<note place="margin">§. 45.</note> him, who ſhould <hi>heare Christs ſayings, and doe them,</hi> and in that reſpect is compared to a <hi>wiſe Man, who built his Houſe upon a Rock, &amp;c.</hi> is not to be underſtood ſuch a Perſon, who ſhall at preſent, and for a time after hearing, <hi>doe the ſayings</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and afterwards <hi>doe</hi> that, which is contrary unto them; but who ſhall <hi>doe</hi> them, and continue in the Practiſe and <hi>doing</hi> of them, unto the end. This is evident by the courſe of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in ſuch Paſſages as theſe. <hi>Look to your ſelves, that we looſe not the things, which we have done, but that we may receive a full reward</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Joh. <hi>ve. 8.</hi>
               </note>. Which words plainly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that we may <hi>doe</hi> many things of a beneficiall tendency and import (which muſt needs be by <hi>doing the ſayings of Christ</hi>) and yet loſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of ſuch <hi>doings,</hi> by turning-aſide out of the way of them, before we come to receive our <hi>reward.</hi> So againe:—<hi>the love of many ſhall wax cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he that continueth unto the end, ſhall be ſaved</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 24</note>. The <hi>Galatians did</hi> for a time, <hi>run well</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 5. 7.</note>, yea and <hi>ſuffered</hi> many things for <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and the Goſpells ſake <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 3. 4.</note>: but afterwards they were <hi>bewitched</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note>, proved diſobedient to the Truth, and ſo <hi>fell from that Grace</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 5. 4.</note> and favour of God, wherein they ſtood, whileſt they obeyed the Goſpell. But we ſhall (God willing) in due time muſter greater numbers of ſuch paſſages as theſe.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt compariſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 8. hath leſſe colour in the face of<note place="margin">§. 46.</note> it, then either of the former. In this, they who <hi>receive the Word with good and honest Hearts,</hi> are compared unto <hi>ſeed, that fell on good ground, which ſpringeth up, and beareth fruit an hundred fold.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not ſaid, that <hi>the ſeed which fell on good ground, are they, who hear the Word with a good and honest Heart,</hi> but, who <hi>having heard the Word, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or keepe it in a good and honest Heart.</hi> The tenor of the place in <hi>Luke,</hi> is this: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:94900:148"/>

               </gap> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 8. 15.</note>. So that it is not ſimply the hearing of the Word <hi>with a good and honeſt Heart,</hi> that brings Men under the compariſon of the <hi>ſeed that fell into good ground;</hi> but the <hi>retaining</hi> and keeping of it in ſuch an <hi>Heart,</hi> and that ſo, as to <hi>bring forth fruit with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: i. e.</hi> with parient continuance in well doing (whatever temptations they ſhall meet with to interrupt them in their way) as the word is tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. both by our Engliſh Tranſlators, and by <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets the place accordingly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Saviours intent in deſcribing the ſeverall tempers and conditions of thoſe that ſhould hear the Goſpell, together with the event and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their hearings reſpectively, by that variety of grounds, which the Parable of the Sower ſpeaketh of, was not to aſſert the abſolute neceſſity of the ſeverall events ſpecified upon the reſpective hearings, as if (for inſtance) thoſe who at the time of their firſt hearing, were like unto the <hi>thorny ground,</hi> muſt neceſſarily miſcarry, and never afterwards believe ſavingly; but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and admoniſh the World, what is like to be the event and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and what ordinarily is the event and conſequence, of ſuch hearings, as are here deſcribed by the ſeverall tempers of thoſe that heare, being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall, and of long ſtanding with them. For otherwiſe there is no abſolute impoſsibility, but that he, in whoſe Heart the Goſpell is for the preſent much incumbred and choked with the Cares and Pleaſures of this life, and ſo hath been for a long ſeaſon, may yet recover Himſelf from under this great diſadvantage, and ſo believe unto Salvation; though ſuch a recovery as this be very difficult and rare; which is all that our Saviour intended to ſhew, or teach, in this part of the Parable. There is the ſame conſideration of all the other grounds, or kinds of hearers. So that though he that ſhould hear the word <hi>with a good &amp; honest heart,</hi> ſhould be compared to the <hi>ſeed falling on good ground,</hi> yet could there not an abſolute neceſsity be concluded from hence, that therefore ſuch a Man muſt bring forth fruit unto Salvation; but only a great likelyhood, and hopefull Probability, that ſuch an heater will not miſcarry by the way, but will hold out with Patience in well doing unto the end, and ſo be ſaved. So that there is nothing in this Argument neither, to keepe that Doctrine from falling, which is already ſhaken. Therefore,</p>
            <p>A tenth Argument is built by ſome for the honour of the ſaid Doctrine,<note place="margin">§. 47.</note> upon ſuch <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which teſtifie, that ſuch as doe not Peſevere, but make either a totall, or finall defection, in, or from the Faith, were never true Believers, or by a true Faith ingrafted into <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and that make it the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, or badg of a true Believer, that he ſtill doth continue in the Faith. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> Produced to juſtifie this account, are <hi>Joh. 8. 31. 1 Joh. 2. 19. Heb.</hi> 3. 6. 14. To this alſo we anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. (In generall) three things, 1. That there is no good conſiſtency of ſence in it, to ſay, that they fall away from Faith, who never were at it, never were true Believers. If it be ſaid, that Men are ſaid to fall away from Faith, when they fall away from ſuch a Faith as they had, as <hi>viz.</hi> from a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Faith, or a light and ſuperficiall believing of the Goſpell, &amp;c. I anſwer, 1. If this be the Faith, from which Men are ſaid to fall, in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> then muſt this needs be the Faith alſo, wherein they are exhorted and charged to Perſevere. For thoſe that have in any kinde, or with any Faith imbraced the Goſpell, and made Profeſsion of it, are exhorted to continue in the Faith. Now that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould perſwade Men to continue in a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:94900:149"/> temporary Faith (I meane in ſuch a Faith, which is not accompained with juſtification, or, which worketh not by love, or which will certainly faile) imports a kinde of impious contradiction. 2. If this were all the apoſtaſie or backſliding from Faith, mentioned in the <hi>Scriptures, viz.</hi> to apoſtatize from a temporary, falſe, hypocriticall, dead Faith, the ſin of apoſtaſie would not be a ſin of that deep demerit, or high Provocation unto God, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſo frequenly declareth it to be. Nor hath God any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay, <hi>that his Soule ſhall have no pleaſure</hi> in ſuch Men, who withdraw themſelves from an Hypocriticall, feyned, or unſound Faith. 3. And laſtly it is no where to be found in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> either explicitly, or implicity, that they who make <hi>Shipwrack of Faith,</hi> or prove Apoſtates, were no true or ſound Believers at any time, before this ſhipwrack; but the contrary hereunto will be made manifeſt in due time. In the mean while to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> upon which this argument is built, I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="2">2. And in Particular, 1. That theſe words <hi>of Chriſt (Joh. 8. 31.) If yee</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 48.</note> 
               <hi>continue in my words, then are you my Diſciples indeed,</hi> doe not imply, that in caſe they ſhould not <hi>continue in his words</hi> for the time to come, it would argue that they were not <hi>His Diſciples</hi> at the preſent; but that they could not approve themſelves Diſciples of His upon thoſe excellent and bleſſed terms, which being Diſciples of His at preſent, they very well might doe, and were hereby in a ready way of doing, unleſſe they did <hi>continue in his words, [i. e.</hi> in obedience unto His Commands] unto the end. For that they were His Diſciples at preſent, without any reſpect to their <hi>continuance,</hi> or non <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in his words,</hi> for the future, is evident from the words immediately preceding in the ſame <hi>Verſe: Then ſaid Jeſus to thoſe Jews who believed on him.</hi> Therefore being ſuch who <hi>believed on him,</hi> they were His true Diſciples; though they had not had opportunity as yet to approve themſelves <hi>His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples indeed, i. e.</hi> ſo as to obtaine eternall happineſſe by their Diſcipleſhip in this kinde.</p>
            <p>2. For thoſe words, <hi>Heb. 3. 6.—whoſe houſe are we, if we hold faſt the</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 49.</note> 
               <hi>confidence, and the rejoycing of the hope firme unto the end;</hi> together with thoſe (of like character, <hi>Verſe. 14.) For we are made partakers of Chriſt, if we hold the beginning of our confidence ſtedfaſt unto the end,</hi> there is much the ſame conſideration of them with the former. The meaning is not (as the rigor of the letter ſeems to hold forth) as if their being the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> or <hi>partakers of Christ,</hi> at preſent, depended upon their future being, of what for the preſent they were (things that are, are what they are, ſo, or ſo, ſuch or ſuch, determinately, whatſoever followes, or not followes, in the future,) no nor yet as if their future Perſeverance would declare, that their preſent eſtates or ſtanding in the Faith, was good; (for they, whoſe Faith for the preſent, is weak, and not able to juſtifie them, may notwithſtanding inſenſibly, both to themſelves and others, grow up in time to ſuch a Faith, which is juſtifying, and may perſevere in it accordingly) but only to ſhew, that their being the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> for the preſent (and ſo, their being <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt,</hi> for the preſent) would ſtand them in little ſtead, would in the end and upſhort of all be, as if they had not been, yea and of a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence too, then ſo, unleſſe they perſevered in the ſame Faith and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion unto the end. This Expoſition of the places is fully conſiſtent with the maine drift and ſcope of the Epiſtle, which was, not to teach the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> to know whether they were true Believers, or no, at preſent, much leſſe to teach them this knowledge, by what they ſhould approve themſelve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:94900:149"/> to be, to the day of their death (which had been to give Men darkneſſe to ſee by) but to animate, incourage, urge, and preſſe them to continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in that Faith, which at preſent they had imbraced, and made profeſſion of, unto the end.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) as to thoſe words, 1 <hi>Ioh. 2. 19. They went out from us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 50.</note> 
               <hi>but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, &amp;c.</hi> we gave a large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the preceding Chapter <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 10. Sect. 21, 22, &amp;c.</note>, where we gave evidence upon evidence that there is no ſuch thing ſo much as ſuppoſed, or inſinuated, in them, as that they, who once truly believe, muſt of neceſſity alwayes perſevere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. The cleere ſcope and drift of the Context carries them quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. I ſhall here only adde this: that the Apoſtles ſcope being (as is evident from that verſe, and the words next preceding) to caution them againſt thoſe Anti-Chriſtian Teachers, that were abroad in the World, leſt they ſhould be ſeduced by them, it had been very incongruous, and enough to blunt, if not quite to take off the edge of ſuch a caution, ſo imediately to ſubjoyne ſuch a Doctrine, from whence they might conclude, that it was a thing unpoſſible for them to be ſeduced, at leaſt to the making ſhipwrack of their <hi>Faith.</hi> Beſides, that it was not unpoſſible for them to be thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, is fully evident from <hi>Verſe 24. Let that therefore abide in you, which yee have heard from the beginning: if that which you have heard from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſhall remaine in you, yee alſo ſhall continue in the Son, and in the Father.</hi> If there had been an impoſſibility, either that the word, <hi>which they heard from the beginning,</hi> ſhould not have <hi>remained</hi> in them, to the end; or that they ſhould not have <hi>continued in the Son,</hi> doubtleſſe the Apoſtle would never have ſubjected the former unto queſtion, nor ſuſpended the latter upon the taking place of it: both which are manifeſtly done by Him in the ſaid words. No Man ſpeaks at ſo poore a rate of reaſon and ſence, as this: If the light makes things viſible, then may an Horſe, or a Man, be ſeen by it.</p>
            <p>Another Argument calculated for the ſupport of the received Doctrine<note place="margin">§. 51.</note> of Perſeverance, pretends regulation by many pregnant places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which beare, that true Believers, who are partakers of the quickning Spirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of Regeneration, cannot either totally, or finally loſe them, or fall away from them. The places levied upon this account are, <hi>Rom. 6. 2. &amp; Verſe 8, 9, 10, 11. 1 Joh. 3. 9. 1 Joh. 5, 4. 18. Jude. Ver. 3. Apoc.</hi> 20. 6. To this I anſwer.</p>
            <p>That upon due examination none of theſe places will be found guilty of any ſuch Doctrine, as they ſtand charged with in this Argument. We have at large (in the former <hi>Chapter</hi>) cleared the innocency of one of them (<hi>viz. 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 9.) which bears the greateſt heat and burthen of the charge: to the reſt we anſwer in courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom. 6. 2. How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi> Theſe words import no impoſſibility of their returning unto ſin, who are <hi>dead to it</hi> (at leaſt, who by the tenor and band of their Chriſtian Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>are dead to it,</hi> for of this kinde of <hi>death to ſin</hi> the Apoſtle ſeemes here to ſpeak) but only a great and ſignall unworthineſſe in them ſo to doe. So that the interrogative particle, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>how,</hi> carries ſome ſuch ſence with it, as this: with what face; or, with what conſcience; or, with what comfort, peace, or the like. HOVV <hi>then</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to His Miſtreſſe) <hi>can I doe this great wickedneſſe, and ſin against God</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 39. 9.</note>? HOVV <hi>can I doe it,</hi> doth not here imply an impoſſibility for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to have committed the ſin, but only a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemlineſſe,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94900:150"/> or unworthineſſe. See alſo <hi>Mat. 6. 4.

For in that He died, He died unto ſin once: but in that He liveth, He li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth unto God. Likewiſe reckon yee alſo your ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin, &amp;c.</hi> The intent of the Apoſtle in theſe paſſages, is nothing leſſe, then to teach, or inſinuate a non-poſſibility of their returning or <hi>living againe</hi> unto ſin, who at preſent are <hi>dead</hi> unto it: ſuch a ſuppoſall as this is diametrally inconſiſtent, with the emphaticall energy of His exhortation, <hi>Verſe 12. Let not ſin therefore reigne in your mortall bodies,</hi> as likewiſe with many other pregnant <hi>Scriptures</hi> (which ſhall be conſulted with in due time) but to ſet forth the ſpirituall condition of the Children of God, partly in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of what it is, partly in reſpect of what it ſhould, or ought to, be, by a metaphor or ſimilitude borrowed, from what happened unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, or literally, after this manner. As <hi>Chriſt died</hi> once corporally, (for the aboliſhing or taking away of the ſins of Men) but now <hi>liveth</hi> and acteth for the advancement of the Glory of God, and is not obnoxious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any more dyings in that kinde: in like manner, they who are his, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or profeſſe themſelves, to be His, ought to be conformable to Him in theſe things, in a ſpirituall way, as <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>dying unto ſin (i. e.</hi> by endvour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſtroy and work out all ſinfull diſpoſitions from within them, and by ceaſing from all Sinfull actions and wayes) and againe, by <hi>living unto God (i. e.</hi> Righteouſly, Holily, and ſo that God may be glorified in the World by the excellency of their converſations) and by perſevering and continuing in this courſe of <hi>living unto God,</hi> without relapſing into that death in ſin, which is oppoſite hereunto, even as <hi>Christ liveth unto God,</hi> ſo as never to ceaſe thus living unto Him. Therefore all that can be inferr'd from this contexture of <hi>Scripture,</hi> is the duty of Perſeverance in Faith and Holineſſe, or neceſſity of it, in reſpect of the great obligation to it, that lieth upon the Saints, and that profeſſe intereſt in <hi>Christ,</hi> and expect Salvation by Him; not any abſolute, not any ſuch neceſſity of it, which is unavoideable or undeclineable by the Saints. For to what purpoſe ſhould they be ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, ſo ſeriouſly cautioned againſt that, whereby they were not in any poſſibility of ſuffering inconvenience? If it were impoſsible that <hi>ſin</hi> ſhould <hi>reigne in their mortall bodies,</hi> after they were once <hi>dead</hi> to it, needleſſe and vaine had that exhortation been, <hi>Let not ſin reigne in your mortall bodies.</hi> The common maxime among Divines and interpreters of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> is, that <hi>Similitudes,</hi> or Metaphors; <hi>doe not run on all foure;</hi> meaning, that they are not to be extended or applied to the ſpirituall thing intended to be illuſtrated by them, in all the properties or relations which are found in thoſe things,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94900:150"/> from which they are taken; but in reſpect of that only, which ſuits naturally with the ſcope of the place, where they are uſed. From the conſideration of <hi>Chriſts</hi> death once ſuffered by him, without being liable to <hi>die</hi> the ſecond time, and ſo of His <hi>living unto God,</hi> without danger of ever having this <hi>life</hi> extinguiſhed, or taken from Him, cannot be proved, either that Men, who are once <hi>dead unto ſin,</hi> can no more live to it; or that Men once <hi>alive unto God,</hi> cannot poſſibly ſuffer any interruption, or loſſe, of this life. Becauſe theſe particulars are not mentioned, or inſiſted upon by the Apoſtle, to prove the abſolute, but only an Hypotheticall or conditionall neceſsity of the Saints conforming themſelves ſpiritually unto them, or unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in reſpect of them, <hi>viz.</hi> if they meane to anſwer the tenor and import of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holy Profeſsion, or to obtaine Life and Salvation herein, in the end.</p>

Not that ſuch vigilancy and care as this, are always perform'd, and taken by Him, (the contrary hereunto is too much experimented) but that there is a certaine propenſneſſe in that <hi>Divine nature,</hi> wherein He par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes by being <hi>borne of God,</hi> that inclines Him hereunto. Men are often in <hi>Scripture</hi> Dialect ſaid to doe that, not which they alwayes doe, but which
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94900:151"/> they are apt and likely to doe, and which very frequently, or cuſtomarily they doe (indeed;) and ſometimes, that which is their duty to doe. In this Dialect our Saviour ſpeaketh, when He ſaith, <hi>If any Man walke in the day, He ſtumbleth not [i. e.</hi> He is not apt to <hi>ſtumble,</hi> or, He doth not ordinarily ſtumble] <hi>becauſe He ſeeth the light of the Sun. But if a Man walke in the night, He ſtumbleth [i. e.</hi> He is apt to <hi>ſtumble,</hi> or He often <hi>ſtumbleth] becauſe there is no light in Him</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 11. 9, 10</note>. So likewiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul: He that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, careth for the things of the Lord, how He may pleaſe the Lord [i. e.</hi> frequently He doth ſo, or He hath an opportunity, which the married hath not, to do it: for otherwiſe we know, that many <hi>unmarried</hi> Perſons are far from <hi>caring for the things of the Lord.] But He that is married, careth for the things of the World, how He may pleaſe His Wife</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 32. 33.</note>. His meaning is not, that the <hi>married,</hi> alwayes, and without exception of any one in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thus miſcarrieth; there are ſome Married Perſons, that tread lighter on the Earth, I meane, that are leſſe addicted to the World, then many that are unmarried. But only that Perſons ſo ingaged and related, have a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation upon them, more then the unmarried, and ſo are apt to turne aſide on that hand, yea and frequently doe ſo. That which followeth is of the ſame character. <hi>There is a difference alſo between a Wife, and a Virgin: the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married Woman careth for the things of the Lord, that ſhe may be holy, both in body and in ſpirit: but ſhee that is married, careth for the things of the World, how ſhe may pleaſe her husband.</hi> The Booke of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> aboundeth with ſuch veynes of expreſſion as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> where Men of ſuch or ſuch a qualification, or relation, are ſimply ſaid to doe ſo, or ſo, according to the nature and <hi>genius</hi> of either, not becauſe they doe alwayes and univerſally ſo, but becauſe they are diſpoſed, apt, and likly, by reaſon of ſuch a qualification, or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to doe it, and accordingly, often doe it.

               <hi>keepeth Himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. in a declarative ſence, thus: Whoſoever deſireth to approve himſelf, whether to himſelf, or others upon any ſufficient ground, for a Man Regenerate, <hi>or borne of God,</hi> he muſt abſtaine from wayes of <hi>ſin,</hi> and watch narrowly and carefully over himſelf, that the Devill may not do him the leaſt hurt (as our Engliſh <hi>Annotators</hi> interpret the Phraſe, <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him not:</hi>) This interpretation reduceth the place to a like ſence and notion
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94900:151"/> with that in the ſame Epiſtle, (formerly opened) <hi>Little children, let no Man deceive you: He that doth righteouſneſse, is righteous</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 7.</note>; meaning, that no Man hath any ſufficient ground, either to judge Himſelf a <hi>righteous</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or to expect to be ſo judged by others, unleſſe he <hi>doth righteouſneſſe,</hi> i. e. lives holily, and in a conſcientious obſervance of the Commandements of God <note n="b" place="margin">See Cap. 9. Sect. 11.</note>. There are many aſſertions and ſayings in <hi>Scripture</hi> of like conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with this. Now this Interpretation doth not finde in the words any impoſſibility for the Regenearte Man to <hi>ſin,</hi> or any abſolute neceſſity that he muſt ſo <hi>keepe himſelf,</hi> that the <hi>evill one</hi> ſhall <hi>not touch him;</hi> but only a neceſſity for him to refraine the one, and to practiſe the other, if he deſires upon good and ſufficient grounds, either the comfort within, or the honour without, of being <hi>born of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for that Argument, which ſome build upon the metaphor or ſimilitude<note place="margin">§. 56.</note> of the naturall Birth, or generation, <hi>viz.</hi> that as Men are capable only of being once borne, and cannot loſe the ſubſtance of that nature, wherein they were borne, or change their <hi>ſpecies</hi> afterwards; ſo neither are men capable of being <hi>borne of God,</hi> more then once, or of loſing the ſubſtance or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this birth, being once made partakers of it; this Argument (I ſay) is built upon one of the lame feete of the ſimilitude, on which it neither runs, nor ſtands. For it cannot be proved from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the naturall generation, or birth, is borrowed or uſed by the Holy Ghoſt, to ſignifie, teach, or import any ſuch thing, as this; but only to ſhew, either, 1. That Men have no being, no compleat, perfect, or deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able being, till they be ſpiritually <hi>born of God</hi> (in which reſpect they are ſaid to be, <hi>nothing,</hi> who are not regenerate, or born of him <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 6. 3.</note>:) or elſe, 2. To ſhew, that as no Man comes to partake of the nature, or naturall properties or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of Men, but by a ſuteable generation, <hi>i. e.</hi> by a generation or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation from Man, ſo neither do or can, men partake of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or true holineſs, but by a proportionable deſcent from God: or 3. To ſhew, that as Men, in, and by means of their naturall generation and birth, come to partake of the ſame Properties, Principles, and Propenſions, which are naturall to their Parents, who beget them, and act according to the <hi>genius</hi> of ſuch Properties, Principles, and Propenſions; ſo doe they, who are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Propagated by God, in, and by means of this Propagation, receive ſuch Principles and Impreſſions, which are in God Himſelfe, and withall act and move in the World, according to the Heavenly <hi>genius,</hi> ducture, bent, and tendency of theſe; or elſe perhaps (4. And laſtly) to ſhew, that as the effect of naturall generation, <hi>i. e.</hi> the conception of the Perſon generated in the Womb, is ſecret, and unſeen, and for the manner of it, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unknown, unto Men; (<hi>as thou knowest not what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones doe grow in the Wombe of her that is with Child</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Eccleſ. 11. 5</note>.) So is the manner of Gods dealing with the Heart, Soul, and Conſcience of a Man, in and about the act of Regeneration, of a very abſtruſe conſideration, and remote from the apprehenſions and underſtandings of Men, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>The winde bloweth where it liſteth: and thou hearest the ſound thereof: but canſt not tell whence it commeth, and whither it goeth: ſo is every one that is borne of the Spirit</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Joh. 3. 8.</note>. That theſe Particulars are, or may be, imported in the Metaphor or Reſemblance of the naturall generation; may be proved from the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> But that by the impoſſibility for a Man to paſſe from that ſpecies, wherein he was borne, into another, which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the birth naturall, was intended to ſignifie a correſpondent impoſſibility
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94900:152"/> in the birth ſpirituall, can no more be proved, then that this generation or birth conſiſts in a change of eſſentialls, and not of qualities only, or that it is a generation of a corporeall ſubſtance, becauſe both theſe are found in the naturall generation. And who knows not, that by ſtraining and ſtretching ſimilitudes beyond their ſtaple, I mean, beyond what is intended to be ſignified by them, an endleſſe generation of abſurd, in-coherent and monſtrous conceits may be produced? But,</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> doe not only no where countenance any ſuch deduction<note place="margin">§. 57.</note> from the ſaid <hi>ſimile,</hi> but plainly enough aſſert the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that Men may paſſe from one ſpirituall ſpecies into another, and repaſſe into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer againe. <hi>My little children</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galathians) of whom I travell in birth</hi> againe <hi>untill Christ be formed in you</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note>. And againe: <hi>yee did run well: who did hinder you, that you ſhould not obey the truth</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 5. 7.</note>? yet again: <hi>Christ is become of none effect unto you, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law: yee are fallen from Grace</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Verſe 4.</note>. So when the Apoſtle affirms it to <hi>be impoſsible to renew thoſe by Repentance, who have once been inlightened, &amp;c.</hi> in caſe <hi>they fall away</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 6. 4. 6.</note>, He cleerly ſuppoſeth, 1. That ſome Men may <hi>fall away,</hi> who may be <hi>renewed by Repentance, i. e.</hi> reſtored to their former <hi>ſpecies</hi> in Faith and Holineſſe, from which they had been transformed by ſin. 2. That others may fall away, and be trans-ſpeciated upon ſuch terms, that they are uncapable of ſuch reſtauration. But of theſe paſſages more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Nor doth that of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Though you have ten thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors in Chriſt, yet have yee not many Fathers: for in Chriſt Ieſus I have begotten you through the Goſpell</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 15.</note>, import the contrary. For 1. He doth not ſay, that it was not poſſible for them to <hi>have many Fathers,</hi> but only that <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> they <hi>had not many.</hi> This implies, that <hi>Paul</hi> was the inſtrument of God, for, and in, their converſion to the Faith, at the beginning; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that they at preſent perſiſted in that Faith, or ſpecies of Believers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, or wherein, He had <hi>begotten</hi> them. But it no wayes ſuppoſeth, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, either that they were unchangeable in that <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> wherein He had <hi>begotten</hi> them; or uncapable of being <hi>begotten</hi> the ſecond time, in caſe they had been actually changed. 2. Our <hi>Engliſh Divines</hi> in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations upon the place, by <hi>Fathers,</hi> underſtand ſuch as were <hi>tender</hi> over them, and <hi>free,</hi> in their Teachings: as by <hi>Instructors,</hi>

(And laſtly) in ſaying that they <hi>had not many Fathers,</hi> He doth not neceſſarily imply, that they had no more but one <hi>Father;</hi> but (poſſibly) that they had but very few. For <hi>many,</hi> is not alwayes, nay ſeldom, oppoſed to, <hi>one;</hi> but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and more frequently, unto <hi>few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next <hi>Scripture</hi> attempted in favour of the ſaid Argument, is that<note place="margin">§. 58.</note> wherein the Saints are exhorted to <hi>contend earneſtly for the Faith, which was once delivered unto the Saints</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Jude. <hi>v. 3.</hi>
               </note>. But neither doth this place, ſo much as in face, look like Pillar, or Prop, of the Doctrine we oppoſe. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>Faith,</hi> is not here meant the Grace of <hi>Faith,</hi> or juſtifying <hi>Faith,</hi> but (by a metonymie, either of the efficient, for the effect, or of the object, for the faculty) as in twenty places beſides, the Doctrine, or word of Faith. <hi>Faith</hi> (ſay our Engliſh Annotators upon the place) <hi>is not here taken for faithfulneſſe, nor for credulity, nor for confidence, nor for Faith of miracles, but for the Doctrine of the Goſpell, which is to be believed. So hope is taken for the thing hoped for,</hi> Rom. 8. 24. Coloſ. 1. 5. This expoſition of the word, <hi>Faith,</hi> is confirmed by the Apoſtle Himſelf, affirming it to have been <gap reason="foreign">

For without ſuch a ſuppoſition, the Prophet muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpeak thus: <hi>when a righteous Man turneth away from his righteouſneſs and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them, [i. e.</hi> leaveth his naturall life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of them, and without Repentance for them] <hi>for the iniquity that he hath done ſhall He</hi> [leave his naturall life, or, have his naturall life taken from him.] When a Man dieth in, or under the guilt of His ſin, He ſhall die for His ſin, or becauſe of the guilt of His ſin, the ſame death, which He dieth in His ſin. Who taſteth not a palpable abſurdity, and incoherence of ſence, in ſuch a conſtruction as this? whereas, if by <hi>dying,</hi> in the latter clauſe, we ſhall underſtand, <hi>dying,</hi> or periſhing for ever, the ſentence will run cleer, and in full conſonancy with the generall current of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the ſence riſing thus: <hi>when a righteous Man</hi> ſhall forſake the wayes of <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> wherein he hath formerly walked, and turn aſide into wayes of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not repent of theſe wayes before His death, this Man ſhal die the death of the impenitent and unbelievers, which is the <hi>ſecond Death.</hi> In this ſence, the ſentence perfectly accords (for ſubſtance of matter) with ſuch paſſages as theſe: <hi>Know yee not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God?

Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe His wickedneſſe, whereunto He hath turned aſide from His <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> will not befriend Him with a <hi>deliverance.</hi> Nor can it any whit more reaſonably be ſaid, that though His former <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> will not <hi>deliver</hi>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:94900:154"/> Him from a temporall <hi>death,</hi> yet it may <hi>deliver</hi> Him from <hi>eternall death;</hi> then in the caſe of a true Repentance it may be ſaid, that though ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will deliver a Man from a temporall death, yet will it not deliver Him from eternall death. For as the trueſt Repentance that is, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in, will not deliver a Man from a temporall or naturall death, but will moſt certainly deliver him from eternall death: in like manner, though A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie and backſliding from wayes of righteouſneſſe, perſevered in, doe not alwayes expoſe a Man to a temporall death, or bring this death upon Him, yet they alwayes render Men obnoxious to eternall death.</p>
            <p>Beſides, when God threateneth ſuch backſliders as we ſpeak of, that when<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> they ſhall <hi>commit iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all the righteouſneſſe that they have done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, ſhall not be mentioned, i. e.</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> Himſelf interprets) <hi>ſhall not come into any account, as to matter of reward</hi>

Calv. in</hi> Ezek. 18. 24</note>, evident it is, that if it ſhall not come into any account at all, (as for example) to obtaine from God ſo much as the reward of a temporall deliverance, much leſſe ſhall it turne to any ſuch account, as to be rewarded with that <hi>great recompence of reward,</hi> Salvation.</p>
            <p>Againe, that <hi>Death</hi> which God here threateneth againſt that double, or two fold iniquity of backſliding, is oppoſed to that life, which is promiſed to Repentance, and Perſeverance in well doing. But this life is confeſſed by all, to be <hi>eternall life:</hi> therefore the <hi>death</hi> oppoſite to it, muſt needs be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, or the <hi>ſecond death.</hi> When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the wages of ſin, is death, but the gift of God is eternall life through Chriſt Ieſus our Lord</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note>; is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the antitheſis or oppoſition in the ſentence, between the death, and life, mentioned in it, that by that <hi>death,</hi> which He affirmes to be <hi>the wages of ſin,</hi> is meant <hi>eternall death?</hi> How elſe will the oppoſition ſtand?</p>
            <p>Yet againe: when God in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> threatens impenitent Perſons with Death for their ſins, doubtleſſe He intends and means, eternall Death, or that Death which is <hi>the wages of ſin.</hi> Otherwiſe we have no ſufficient ground to believe or think, that Men dying in their ſins without Repentance, ſhall ſuffer the <hi>vengeance of eternall fire,</hi> but only a temporall or naturall Death; which the righteous and truly penitent themſelves ſuffer as well as they. Therefore to ſay that God threatens impenitent Apoſtates, (in the place in hand) with a temporall Death only, when as elſewhere He threatens impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency under the lighteſt guilt of all, with <hi>eternall Death,</hi> is (in effect) to repreſent him, as vehement and ſore in his diſſwaſives from ordinary and leſſer ſins; but indifferent and remiſſe in diſſwading from ſins of the greateſt Provocation.</p>
            <p>Once more: if it be only a temporall Death, which God here threatneth againſt the Sons of Apoſtaſie, dying under the guilt of their Apoſtaſie, and of all the ſins they have committed therein, without Repentance, then may Men under the guilt of the greateſt and fouleſt abominations, remaine in the greateſt love and favour of God, as juſt and righteous Men; yea and without Repentance, not only eſcape damnation, but alſo inherit eternall life.

The reaſon why the Perſon leprouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, did not loſe the right He had to His Houſe, before He was leprous, by His becomming a Leper, was, becauſe there was no Law, by which any Mans right or title to His Houſe, was diſabled or made voyd, by Leproſie: whereas in the caſe of Apoſtaſie, there is a plaine Law (or rather many Lawes) eſtabliſhed and declared by the great Law-giver of Heaven, by which backſliders from wayes of righteouſneſſe into wayes of ſin and abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are without Repentance, cut off from all right of title or claime to the inheritance of Heaven. <hi>For this yee know</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, as we heard lately) <hi>that no Whore-monger, or uncleane Perſon, nor covetous Man (who is an Idolater) hath any inheritance [i. e.</hi> any right of <hi>inheritance,</hi> or to inherit: for otherwiſe no righteous Perſon, yet living in the fleſh, hath any actuall <hi>inheritance] in the Kingdome of Chriſt, and of God</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 5. 5.</note>. To object, that this Law or Decree of Heaven holds good againſt ſuch ſinners in every kinde, <hi>Whoremongers, covetous,</hi> &amp;c. who never were <hi>righteous;</hi> not againſt ſuch, who have been <hi>righteous,</hi> though now lapſed into theſe wayes of abomination, is not only to declare a Law without the ſence or authority of the Law-maker, but againſt that Declaration which he hath made of it; who ſtill declareth thoſe the worſt and greateſt of ſinners, who with the lapſed Angells, which we call Devils, revolt from his ſervice and wayes, to walke in wayes that are an abomination to Him. <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O yee Heavens at this, and be horribly afraid: be yee very deſolate, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Why? what is it that cauſeth the Glorious God to appeare in ſuch an extaſie of Paſſion? <hi>For my People</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>have committed two evills: they have forſaken Me the Fountaine of living Waters, and hewed them out Ciſterns, broken Ciſterns, that can hold no water</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Jer. 2. 12, 13.</note>. The <hi>Scripture</hi> is full of ſuch Declarations from God, as this, againſt Apoſtates. So that the <hi>Dort</hi> compariſon palpably faulters in that circumſtance, which ſhould have rendered it appoſite to their Purpoſe.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the <hi>Leprous</hi> Perſon they ſpeak of, though whileſt he lived, had a right to His Houſe (no Law, as was ſaid, depriving Him of this) yet during His leproſie upon Him, He had no right to enter, take Poſſeſſion, or dwell in His Houſe, the Law diſabling him hereunto, in reſpect of his leproſie; and in caſe he had been leprous untill his Death, he ſhould have had no more Power or Right to Poſſeſſe His Houſe, then if his title to it had been wholly loſt: in like manner, ſhould it be granted or ſuppoſed, that the ſpirituall Leper, of whom <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks, had a right to the Kingdome of Heaven, during his Leproſie, yet ſuppoſing the cleaving of this Leproſie to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till death (which is the Prophets ſuppoſition) he could never, (according to the terms of the compariſon) have any right to enter, or to be admitted thereunto: and conſequently his Leproſie, I meane, his apoſtaſie, had been finall, and ſo unto death. Therefore there is nothing gained to the <hi>Dort</hi> cauſe by this Similitude, though it ſhould be allowed a Preheminence above

               </gap>izing <hi>from his own righteouſneſs, it doth not follow, that therefore he hath</hi> WHOLLY, <hi>or</hi> ALTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GETHER <hi>ſhaken off the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> doth he not imply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a man may ſhake off ſome part of the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from him, and yet keep another part of it upon him? or elſe that by ſinning, he may come to wear the intire garment or clothing of it ſo looſely, that it will be ready to drop, or fall off from him every hour? and conſequently, that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſits faſter and cloſer upon ſome, then upon others; yea, upon the ſame perſon at one time, then another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) Were it granted unto the Doctor, that from a mans turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide from his own Holineſs, it doth not follow, that therefore he hath wholly deveſted himſelf of the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> imputed; yet from
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94900:156"/> Gods determination or pronouncing a man to be in an eſtate of condemnation and of death, it follows roundly, that therefore he is deveſted of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> imputed (if ever he were inveſted with it before,) becauſe no man with that Righteouſneſs upon him, can be in ſuch an eſtate. Now we have upon ſeveral grounds proved, that the <hi>Righteous</hi> man under that Apoſtacy, wherein <hi>Ezekiel</hi> deſcribes and preſents him, is pronounced by God, a childe, not of a temporal, but of eternal death and condemnation. This indeed the Doctor denies: but gives no Reaſon of his denial, for which I blame him not. Onely I muſt crave leave to ſay, that the Chair weigheth not ſo much as one good Argument, with me; much leſs, as many. So that all this while, he that ſpake, and ſtill ſpeaks, unto the World, by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> is no friend to that Doctrine, which denyeth the poſſibility of a <hi>righteous</hi> mans declining even unto death.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding ſome formerly (it ſeems) in favor of this Doctrine, attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> an eſcape from that ſword of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> lately drawn againſt it, by pretending that by the <hi>righteous</hi> man mentioned in the Paſſages in hand, is not meant a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon truly and really <hi>righteous,</hi> but a kinde of formal Hypocrite, or outſide Profeſſor of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> But this ſhift had ſo little colour in the face of it, that it cauſed the after-Patrons of the Doctrine to bluſh, and be aſhamed of it. The <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort</hi> it ſelf, though it accepted of many helps in other caſes, of every whit as little ſtrength, as this, yet judging it ſelf better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided at that point, where this was offered to relieve it, it was rejected by the Members of this <hi>Synod,</hi> and that with ſome kinde of diſparagement put upon it; I will not ſay, with any ſuch intent, or eye, that they who thus rejected it, might be looked upon as men, who would own nothing but what was ſolid and ſubſtantial. The fore-mentioned Doctor alſo rewards the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> with his approbation, for refuſing to entruſt their cauſe in the hand of ſuch a ſorry Advocate, as this. So that we ſhall not need to cauſe this Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to paſs through the fire, for the tryal of it, in as much as it hath been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely ſtigmatized for reprobate ſilver, by the greateſt Maſters of that cauſe, for the maintenance whereof it was deviſed. And indeed the whole <hi>ſeries</hi> and carriage of the Context from <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. to the end of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively evinceth, that by the <hi>righteous</hi> man all along is meant ſuch a man, as was, or is, truly <hi>righteous,</hi> and who, had he perſevered in that way of Righteouſneſs, wherein he ſometimes walked, ſhould have worn the Crown of Righteouſneſs, and received the reward of a <hi>righteous</hi> man. As by the <hi>wicked</hi> man all along, oppoſed to him, is meant, not a perſon ſeemingly <hi>wicked,</hi> but truly and really ſo, (as is acknowledged on all hands.) So that the <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> or oppoſition, between the <hi>righteous,</hi> and the wicked, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo viſibly quite through the body of the Diſcourſe, muſt needs be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if by the <hi>righteous</hi> man, ſhould be meant, a Perſon ſeemingly <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> only; he that is <hi>righteous</hi> in this ſence, being truly and really <hi>wicked.</hi> Yea, <hi>Calvin</hi> writing upon the place, though he ſets himſelf to manage it ſo, that the cauſe of Perſeverance may not ſuffer damage by it, and in order hereunto turns many a ſtone to make the <hi>righteous</hi> man, a man ſeemingly <hi>righteous</hi> onely, yet now and then by the force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Power of the Truth, is turn'd quite out of the way of his deſign; ſo as to make this <hi>righteous</hi> man, <hi>righteous</hi> in ſuch a ſence, that nothing ſhould be wanting unto him, but Perſeverance in his way, to make him bleſſed <note n="a" place="margin">

Thus far this Great Aſſertor of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and of the cauſe which they maintained, to ſhew the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſuch a ſence or conſtruction put upon the words now in debate, which ſhall render them meerly conditional, and will not allow them to import ſo much as a poſſibility of any thing contained, or expreſſed in them. To which much more of like demonſtration might be added, if I conceived that light
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94900:157"/> ſtood in need of light for the manifeſtation of it. To ſay, that God putteth a caſe, in ſuch ſolemnity and emphaticalneſs of words and phraſe, as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable all along the carriage of the place in hand, of which there is no poſſibility that it ſhould ever happen, or be exemplified in reality of event; and this in vindication of himſelf, and the equity of his dealings and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with men, is to bring a ſcandal and reproach of weakneſs (ſuch a weakneſs, as is ſcarce to be paralleld in men) upon that infinite wiſdom of his, which magnifies it ſelf in all his words and works. Which alſo is ſo much the more unworthy and unpardonable, when there is a ſence commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, every ways worthy, as well the infinite wiſdom, as goodneſs of God, pertinent and proper to the occaſion He hath in hand, which offers it ſelf plainly, clearly, without any ſtraining of word, or Phraſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>

Further ſatisfaction herein may be had for the Price only of ſo much Paines, as the Peruſall of the 54. and 59. Sections of the 8. Chapter of this Diſcourſe will require.</p>
            <p>Nor doth the reverſall of ſuch acts of grace in God as we ſpeak of, argue<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> the leaſt mutability, or <hi>ſhadow of change</hi> in Him, either in reſpect of His Love, Counſells, or Decrees; it only argueth a change and alteration in Men. For at that very inſtant, when God loveth a Perſon, and juſtifieth him, in reſpect of his Faith, he hateth with a perfect hatred, and ſuch which hath death and deſtruction in the Womb of it, all wicked, cruell, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull Men whatſoever. So that in caſe that Perſon, whom God now loveth and juſtifieth, ſhall at any time hereafter turne wicked, cruell, unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, or the like (which is very poſſible for him to doe) he falleth under that hatred of God, which was in him, even whileſt he loved him, and which is alwayes in him, unchangeably, unalterably, and indiſpenſably, in reſpect of any Perſon, or Perſons whatſoever. Therefore in ſuch a caſe as this, there is no alteration or change of affection in God, but onely a change of minde, will, and wayes in Men, and that from better unto worſe. A Man living, or travelling in a temperate climate, finds no inconvenience or offence, either from cold, or heat: but let him remove his dwelling, or travell, either ſo far North, where extremity of cold reigneth, or ſo far towards the South, where heat rageth, he will accordingly ſuffer, from the one, and the other. Yet this alteration in the ſtate or condition of his body, doth not argue any alteration at all in the Heavens, or in the Earth, or in the Aire: theſe remaine ſo affected, whileſt he ſuffers from them, as they were, when he was no wayes inconvenienced by them. A Man who by the Lawes of the Land, or State where he liveth, is at preſent obnoxious to no penalty at all, inflicted by theſe Laws upon Malefactors, but is capable of the greateſt dignity or preferment, which that State affordeth, as ſoon as he turneth a Murtherer, or Traitor to this State, deveſts Himſelf of that capacity of honour, wherein He ſtood before, and becomes liable to the ſevereſt Puniſhment, which thoſe Lawes inflict. The Mans condition hereby is much altered, from what it was, and that by reaſon of the Law; but yet the Law it ſelf is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſame which it was, under the one condition of this Man, and the other. In like manner God juſtifieth a Man this day, upon his believing: to morrow, upon a returne to His <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But of this <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>The root or grand occaſion of the common miſtake in this point, (I meane,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> why Men conceive and judge, that if God loves a Man at one time, and hates him at another, he muſt needs be variable in his affection) is that capitall error of a perſonall Election, and Reprobation, or of ſuch a love in God, which ſhould produce the former; and hatred in him, that ſhould cauſe the latter. For if there were any ſuch Affection or Love in God, which did directly and immediately reſpect, or relate unto the Perſon of any Man, then (I confeſſe) it would follow, that if he ſhould at any time hate that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom he ever loved, he ſhould be changeable in his affections. But
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94900:158"/> ſuppoſing that (which we ſhall, God ſparing life, and affording opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity otherwiſe, demonſtratively prove in due time) <hi>viz.</hi> that God beares no Affection, no Love, to the Perſon of any Man, ſimply in reſpect of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perſonality, or becauſe he is this Man, and not another, but that all the love that he beares to Men, or to any Perſon of Man, is either in reſpect of their nature, and as they are Men, in reſpect of which He bears a generall or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon love to them; or in reſpect of their qualifications, as they are good Men, in one degree or other; in reſpect whereof, He bears a more ſpeciall love to them: and againe, that He bears no hatred to the Perſon of any Man ſimply, or, as he is this Man, and not another, but only as he is ſinfull and wicked; it may very eaſily be conceived, how Men may gaine, and loſe, and regain, and againe loſe, the love of God, without the leaſt change or alteration in this his Affection. Suppoſe a Prince loved no one of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, more then another, as they were his ſubjects, but thus far loved them all with a gracious and benevolous affection; yet in caſe any of them ſhould prove more vertuous and deſerving then their fellowes, ſhould upon ſuch an account, expreſſe ſignall and high reſpects of favour unto them; and on the other hand, in caſe any of them prov'd vitious and ill deſerving, ſhould frown upon theſe, and threaten to puniſh them, in caſe of a non-amendment, it may well be apprehended, how the ſubjects of ſuch a Prince, may often both riſe and fall in their Princes affections, He Himſelf remaining uniforme and conſtant herein.</p>
            <p>Another teſtimony from <hi>Scripture,</hi> evidencing the ſame Truth with<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> the former, ſpeaketh theſe words. <hi>But I keepe under my body, and bring it into ſubjection, leaſt by any means, when I have preached unto others, I my ſelf ſhould be a cast-away</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 27.</note>. From which words I argue thus: If <hi>Paul,</hi> after his converſion unto <hi>Christ,</hi> was in a Poſſibility of being, or becoming a Reprobate, or <hi>caſt-away,</hi> then may true Believers fall away both totally and finally (for finally ever includes totally,) But the Antecedent is true: <hi>Paul</hi> after his converſion, was in the poſſibility mentioned. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Major Propoſition (I preſume) will paſſe without controule. The Minor is proved from the place in hand, thus: That which <hi>Paul</hi> was very ſollicitous, and induſtrious to prevent, he was in a poſſibility of ſuffering, or being made. But <hi>Paul</hi> was very ſollicitous and induſtrious to prevent his b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Ergo,</hi> He was in danger or poſſibility of being made a <hi>caſt-away.</hi> The reaſon of the conſequence in the Major Propoſition, is, becauſe no Man of underſtanding will be ſollicitous to prevent or hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to paſſe of ſuch a thing, the coming to paſſe whereof he knows to be impoſſible.</p>

For as there was a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous Poſſibility, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> who did die, might not have died; and againe, in caſe he had not died, that the Perſons who now believe in him, and are ſaved, ſhould not have been ſaved; in like manner, there was a Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both that <hi>Paul,</hi> who did now <hi>keepe under his Body,</hi> might not have kept it under, or might not continue to <hi>keepe it under,</hi> and that in caſe he had not continued to keep it under, he might be a <hi>Reprobate.</hi> Nay, as in caſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not died, there had not been a Poſſibility onely, but even a certainty, of their periſhing, who now by believing on him, are ſaved: in like manner, in caſe <hi>Paul</hi> had deſerted his exerciſe of <hi>keeping under his Body,</hi> there had been more then a poſſibility, and no whit leſſe then a certainty, of his proving a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate;</hi> though now, by means of his perſevering therein unto the end, (as we have cauſe in abundance to judge concerning him] he be ſaved. So that the Argument recoyles, as we ſee, upon the Author himſelf, and the cauſe, which he ſeekes to maintaine by it.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Engliſh Annotators</hi> upon the place are very tender of admitting any<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> ſuch ſence of the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſhould imply any <hi>uncertainty</hi> in the Apoſtle <hi>of his Election, or of obtaining the prize.</hi> But the truth is, that that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:94900:160"/> ſence of the Word, for which we have conteſted, doth no wayes imply the former; nor yet, if by uncertainty be meant any thing grievous or diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apoſtle, the latter. For, 1. He might, notwithſtanding a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of becoming a <hi>Reprobate</hi> afterwards, know certainly that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent He was elected, in as much as know He might with the greateſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (and doubtleſſe, did) that He did believe. And that all thoſe, who truly believe, are elected, our Adverſaries themſelves will not deny. 2. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch a poſſibility as we ſuppoſe, of his becoming a Reprobate, He might have as much <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>obtaining the prize,</hi> as He deſired, or was any wayes meet or reaſonable, for him, either to deſire, or enjoy. This certainty He might have (and queſtionleſſe, had) upon his <hi>continuance in well doing:</hi> and for any Man to be <hi>certaine</hi> of obtaining the prize, though He ſhould apoſtatize and decline into wayes of wickedneſſe, is not a <hi>certainty</hi> either meet for God to give, or for any Man to receive. Somewhat more was ſaid upon this account in the nineth Chapter.</p>
            <p>The next paſſage we ſhall inſiſt upon, to evince the poſsibility of a finall<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> defection in the Saints, openeth it ſelf in theſe words. <hi>For it is unpoſsible for thoſe, who were once enlightened, and have taſted of the Heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have taſted the good Word of God, and the powers of the World to come, If they ſhall fall away, to renew them againe unto Repentance, ſeeing they Crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put Him to an open ſhame. For the Earth, which drinketh in the raine, that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth Herbs meet for them, by whom it is dreſſed, receiveth bleſsing from God. But that which beareth Thornes and Briers, is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6, 7, &amp;c.</note>. Anſwerable hereunto is another in the ſame Epiſtle: <hi>For if we ſin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for ſins, But a certaine fearful looking for of judgement, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries. He that deſpiſed Moſes Law died without mercy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two or three witneſſes. Of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe yee, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 10. 26, 27, &amp;c.</note>. Evident it is, that in theſe two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, the Holy Ghoſt, after a moſt ſerious manner, and with a very pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique and moving ſtraine of ſpeech, and diſcourſe, (ſcarce the like to be found in all the <hi>Scriptures</hi>) admoniſheth thoſe, who are at preſent true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, to take heed of relapſing into the wayes of their former ignorance and impiety. This Caveat or admonition he vehemently preſſeth by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of this import; that in caſe they ſhall thus relapſe, there will be very little, or no hope at all, of their recovery, or returne to the eſtate of Faith and Grace, wherein they now ſtand. Before the faces of ſuch ſayings and paſſages as theſe, rightly underſtood, and duly conſidered, there is no ſtanding for that Doctrine, which denies a poſsibility, either of a totall, or finall, defection in the Saints. But this light alſo is darkened in the Heavens thereof, by the interpoſition of the vailes of theſe two exceptions. 1. That the Apoſtle in the ſaid paſſages affirms nothing poſitively concerning the falling away of thoſe he ſpeaks of, but only conditionally, and upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. 2. That he doth not ſpeak of true and ſound Believers, but of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and ſuch who had Faith onely in ſhew, not in ſubſtance. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe exceptions hath been already non-ſuited, and that by ſome of the ableſt Patrons themſelves of the cauſe of Perſeverance <note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 11. Sect. 9.</note>; where we were
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:94900:160"/> taught from a pen of that learning, <hi>That ſuch conditional ſayings, upon which Admonitions, Promiſes, or Threatenings are built, do at leaſt ſuppoſe ſomething in poſsibility, however by vertue of their Tenor and Form they ſuppoſe nothing in being.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>2. As to the Places in Hand, there is not any Hypothetical ſign, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Particle to be found in either of them, as they come from the Holy Ghoſt, and are carried in the Original. Thoſe two, <hi>iffs,</hi> appearing in the Engliſh Tranſlation, the one in the former Place, the other in the latter, ſhew (it may be) the Tranſlators inclination to the cauſe, but not their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their engagement; an infirmity whereunto they were very ſubject, as we ſhall have occaſion to take notice of the ſecond time ere long, in another inſtance of like partiality. But the Tenor of both the Paſſages in hand is ſo ordered by the Apoſtle, that He plainly declares, how great and fearful the danger is, or will be, <hi>when</hi> Beleevers do, or ſhall, <hi>fall away,</hi> not, <hi>if,</hi> or in caſe, they ſhall <hi>fall away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the latter exception, which pretends to finde onely Hypocrites, and<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> not true Beleevers, ſtaged in both Paſſages, we likewiſe anſwer, that it gloſſeth no whit better, then the former, if not much worſe; conſidering, that the Perſons preſented in the ſaid Paſſages, are deſcribed by ſuch cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and ſignal excellencies, which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are wont to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate unto Saints, and true Beleevers, and that when they intend to ſhew them in the beſt and greateſt of their glory. What we ſay herein, will (I ſuppoſe) be made above all gainſaying by inſtancing Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Perſons ſpoken of, are (in the former of the Paſſages) ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">

The Apoſtle having ſaid, that <hi>the god of this world had blinded the eyes of thoſe, who beleeve nor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt—ſhould ſhine unto them;</hi> He adds ſoon after: <hi>For God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts, <gap reason="foreign">

This is the conſtant acception and import of the Phraſe in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:94900:161"/> the Scriptures. <hi>Always learning</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>of ſilly women, laden with</hi> Sins) <hi>and never able to come <gap reason="foreign">

Therefore by the <hi>acknowledgment of the Truth,</hi> is meant ſuch a cordinal and through aſſent to it, which conſiſts in a ſound and ſaving Faith.

There is but one Place more, where the Phraſe is uſed, and here alſo it bears as high a ſence, as in the teſtimonies already opened. <hi>Paul a Servant of God, and an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Faith of Gods Elect, and the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Truth, which is after godlineſs</hi>

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94900:161"/> onely unto true Believers. Whatſoever is meant by this <hi>Heavenly gift,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is that by <hi>taſting,</hi> is not meant any light or ſuperficial impreſſion made upon the Hearts or Souls of Men through the ſence, or apprehenſion of it, but an emphaticall, inward and affectuous relliſh and ſence of the excellent and Heavenly ſweetneſſe and pleaſantneſſe of it, oppoſed to a bare ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or naked apprehenſion thereof. The reaſon hereof is cleare, <hi>viz.</hi> be cauſe the <hi>taſting</hi> of this <hi>Heavenly gift</hi> here ſpoken of, is not mentioned by the Apoſtle in a way of eaſing or extenuating, the ſin of thoſe that ſhould <hi>fall away</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but by way of aggravation and exaggeration of the heynouſneſſe and unreaſonableneſſe thereof; and withall, more fully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and aſſert the equitableneſſe of that ſeverity in God, which is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt thoſe, that ſhall ſin the great ſin of apoſtacy here ſpoken of. It muſt needs be much more unworthy and provoking in the ſight of God, for a Man to turne His back upon, and renounce thoſe wayes, that Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherein God hath come home to Him, and <hi>anſwered the joy of his heart</hi> abundantly, then it would be, in cauſe He had only heard of great matters, and had His head fill'd, but had had really found and felt nothing with His he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt and Soul, truly excellent and glorious. Therefore to underſtand the Phraſe of <hi>tasting the Heavenly gift,</hi> in any diminutive or extenuating ſence, is to breake the heart (as it were) to diſſipates the ſtrength and Power of the Apoſtles arguing in this place. And beſides, the very word it ſelf, to <hi>taſte,</hi> ordinarily in Scripture, imports a reall communion with, or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation and injoyment (if the thing be good) of, that which is ſaid to be <hi>taſted.</hi> Oh TAST <hi>and ſee</hi> (ſaith <hi>David.) that the Lord is good</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 34. 8.</note>. His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (doubtleſſe) was not to invite Men to a ſlight or ſuperficiall taſte of the goodneſſe of God, but to a reall, cordiall, and through experiment, and ſatisfactory injoyment of it. So when He that made the great invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Parable, expreſſed Himſelf thus to His ſervants: <hi>For I ſay unto you that none of thoſe that were bidden, ſhall</hi> TAST <hi>of my Supper</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 14. 24.</note>, His meaning clearly was, that they ſhould not partake of the ſweetneſſe and benefit thereof with thoſe, who ſhould accept of his invitation, and come unto it. In like manner, when <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh thus to his <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Jews, <hi>If ſo be that yee have</hi> TASTED <hi>that the Lord is gracious</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 3.</note>, his meaning (queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe) is not, to preſſe his exhortation directed unto them in the former Verſe, upon a conſideration of any light or vaniſhing taſte, ſuch as hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and falſe-hearted <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might have, of the <hi>graciouſneſſe of the Lord,</hi> but of ſuch a <hi>taſte,</hi> wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>n they had had a reall, inward, and ſenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment thereof. See other inſtances of the like import of the word, <hi>Acts 10. 10. Mat. 16. 28. Mar. 9. 1. Heb.</hi> 2. 9. &amp;c. Sometimes (I acknowledge) the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>taſte,</hi> ſignifies only a ſlender Perception of the quality or <hi>taste</hi> of a thing; but this is only or chiefly when the reliſh or taſte of a thing is deſired to be known; as <hi>Joh. 2. 9. Mat.</hi> 27. 34. which cannot be affirmed in the Scripture in hand. And beſides, according to the ſence of our adverſaries in the preſent debate, if the <hi>taſte of the Heavenly gift</hi> we ſpeak of ſhould imply no more, but only a faint or weake perception of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and glorious excellency of it, yet even this may be ſufficient to evince truth of Grace and Faith in Men. For their Opinion is, that a Man may be a true Believer with <hi>a graine of Muſtard ſeed</hi> only, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a very ſlender reliſh and taſte of ſpirituall things; yea their ſence is, that in ſome caſes of deſertion, and under the guilt of ſome enormous courſes, they may have little or no taſte of them at all. Therefore we may ſafely conclude, that the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94900:162"/> Perſons, whoſe eſtates and conditions are exibited unto us by the Holy Ghoſt, in the Scriptures in hand, are true Saints, true Believers.</p>

Upon this account the Apoſtle Prayes on the behalf of the <hi>Corinthans,</hi> whom he ſuppoſeth all along to have been true Believers, that <gap reason="foreign">

And if we minde the courſe of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they will informe us, that the Holy Ghoſt was not wont to be given unto Men (and conſequently, they could not be partakers of Him) but upon, and after their believing. See to this purpoſe. <hi>Joh. 7. 39. Acts 19. 2. Eph. 1. 13. Acts 2. 38. Acts 8. 15. 17. Acts 10. 47. Acts 11. 17. Acts 15. 8. 2 Cor. 1. 22. Acts</hi> 5. 32. &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly, thoſe are ſaid to be made <hi>partakers of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are at leaſt true Believers.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, <hi>but</hi> many had the gift of Miracles (and in this reſpect<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> may be ſaid to have been <hi>made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>) who yet never were true Believers, as appeares from thoſe words of Chriſt unto ſome of them; <hi>I never knew you: depart from me, yee that work iniquity</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 7. 23.</note>. To this I anſwer; It is very true, ſome who made Profeſſion of the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet <hi>wrought iniquity</hi> all the while they made this Profeſſion, had the gift of Miracles, for the confirmation of that Faith, which they profeſſed. But ſuch Perſons as theſe are no where in <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaid to have been <hi>made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or to have had communion, or fellowſhip with Him. Even all the while that they wrought Miracles in the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they had communion or fellowſhip with <hi>Satan,</hi> and were partakers of His Spirit. Communion with, or <hi>partaking</hi> of, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is (as hath been ſhewed) in <hi>Scripture</hi> Dealect, appropriated onely to true Believers. And whereas <hi>Christ</hi> will ſay to them, <gap reason="foreign">

But whatſoever in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar be meant by theſe <hi>powers of the World to come,</hi> incontrovertible it is, that in the generall, ſomewhat tranſcendently excellent and glorious
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:94900:163"/> was intended by the Apoſtle to be ſignified by them. So that for any perſon to be admitted to the <hi>taste</hi> of them, <hi>i. e.</hi> to a reall and inward feeling of their vertue, influence, and vigor, upon his Heart and Soul, fully evinceth him to be a member of the Congregation of the firſt borne, to have ſpirituall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by Faith with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Premiſſes relating to the two Paſſages yet under debate, conſidered,<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> I am ſo far from queſtioning whether the Apoſtle ſpeakes of true and ſound Believers in them, that I verily judge that He purpoſely ſought out ſeverall of the moſt emphaticall and ſignall characters of Believers, yea ſuch which are hardly, (or rather not at all) to be found in the ordinary ſort of true Believers, but only in thoſe that are moſt eminent amongſt them, that ſo he might give them to underſtand, and conſider, that not true Believers only, and ſuch, who though ſound, yet were weake in the Faith, might fall away and periſh, but that even ſuch alſo, who were lifted up neerer unto Heaven, then their fellowes, might through careleſneſſe and carnall ſecurity, daſh themſelves in pieces againſt the ſame ſtone, and make ſhipwrack of their Souls, as well as they. Yea, I conceive yet further, that that <hi>impoſsibility of being renewed againe by Repentance,</hi> upon, or after a <hi>falling away,</hi> which he aſſerts in the former Paſſage of the two, was not aſſerted by him with an eye to the ſtate or condition of ordinary believers, in caſe of their <hi>falling away,</hi> as if he intended to conclude them under the heavy doome of ſuch an <hi>impoſsibility,</hi> but with an eye only to the moſt deplorable condition of ſuch, who, having been Sons of the Morning, and ſhined with more luſtre and brightneſſe, then other Stars, in the firmament of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Profeſſion, ſhould notwithſtanding afterwards, fall (with <hi>Satan) like lightening from Heaven</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 10. 18.</note>. My meaning is not to imply, that true Believers, if but of a mean ſtatute and growth in the Faith, are in no danger of finall obduration, or under no great difficulty of recovering their former ſtanding, in caſe they ſhall <hi>fall away,</hi> but onely to obſerve, that that moſt ſerious and ſevere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, adminiſtred by the Apoſtle (in the Paſſages in hand) by way of Antidote againſt the great evill of Apoſtaſie, was in a more ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner calculated for the eſtates and conditions of grand Believers.</p>
            <p>But that it was no part of his intent in the ſaid paſſages to caution Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> or outſide Profeſſors, againſt <hi>falling away,</hi> but true Believers onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the characters already obſerved and examined upon the Point, there are theſe reaſons Pregnant of Proof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is no Clauſe, Phraſe, or Word in either of the places, any ways characteriſticall or Deſcriptive of Hypocriſie, or Hypocrites: there are none of thoſe colours to be ſeene, which are wont to be uſed in drawing or limming the Portraitures, or ſhapes of theſe Beaſts, as diſtinguiſhed from Creatures of a better kinde. All the lineaments of the Perſons preſented in theſe Tables, before the mention of their falling away, become the beſt and faireſt faces of the Saints, (as hath been proved,) and are not to be found in any other. Yea, the greateſt, and moſt intelligent Believer under Heaven, hath no reaſon but to deſire part and fellowſhip with the Hypocrites here deſcribed, in all thoſe Characters and Properties, which are attributed unto them before their <hi>falling away,</hi> or <hi>ſinning wilfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. True Believers, are in an eſtate of honour, and are lifted up on high, towards the Heavens; in which reſpect they have from whence to fall. But Hypocrites are as neere Hell already, as lightly they can be, till they be actually fallen into it. From whence then are they capable of <hi>falling?</hi> Men
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:94900:163"/> of eſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may faile, and break: but beggers are in no ſuch danger. If Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites <hi>fall away,</hi> it muſt be from their Hypocriſie; but this is rather a riſing, then a <hi>Fall.</hi> A Begger cannot be ſaid to break, but onely when he gets an eſtate. When he doth this, the begger is broke.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is no puniſhment at all to Hypocrites, to be under no Poſſibility of being <hi>renewed againe by Repentance.</hi> Nay, in caſe they ſhould <hi>Fall away,</hi> it would be a benefit and bleſſing unto them, to be under an <hi>impoſsibility</hi> of being <hi>renewed againe.</hi> For if this were their caſe, it would be <hi>unpoſsible</hi> for them to be ever Hypocrites <hi>again:</hi> and (doubtleſſe) it is no great judgement upon any Man to be made uncapable of ſuch a preferment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) it ſtands off forty foot at leaſt from all probability, that the Apoſtle writing onely unto thoſe, whom he judged true and ſound Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers (as appears from ſeverall places in the Epiſtle, as <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. 14. 6. 9. &amp;c.) ſhould in the moſt ſerious, emphaticall and weighty paſſages hereof, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them of ſuch evills, or dangers, which only concern'd other Men, and wherunto themſelves were not at all obnoxious: yea and whereunto if they had been obnoxious, all the Cautions, Admonitions, Warnings, Threatnings in the World, would not (according to their Principles, with whom we have now to doe) have relieved, or delivered them. To ſay that ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, are a means to preſerve thoſe from apoſtaſie, who are by other means (as ſuppoſe the abſolute Decree of God, or the interpoſall of his ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Power, for their Perſeverance, or the like) are in no poſſibility of apoſtatizing, is to ſay that waſhing is a means to make Snow white, or the rearing up of a Pillar in the Aire a means to keepe the Heavens from falling. But more of this in the Chapter following.</p>
            <p>Thus then we cleerly ſee by the unpartiall diſcuſsion of the two <hi>Scriptures</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 29.</note> lately inſiſted upon, that there is a poſsibility that true Believers, yea the greateſt in this rank or order of Men, may <hi>fall away,</hi> and that to an <hi>impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

So that thoſe, who onely for a time Believe, and afterward make defection from Chriſt, and from the Goſpell, are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe numbred and ranked by him amongſt Believers. The words in <hi>Luke</hi> are very particular: <hi>They on the Rock, are they which when they heare, receive the word with joy: and theſe have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</hi> From whence it appeares, that the hearers here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, are not compared to the <hi>Rock,</hi> or <hi>Stony ground,</hi> for the hardneſſe of their hearts; in as much as they are ſaid to <hi>receive the word with joy;</hi> which argues an ingenuity and teachableneſſe of ſpirit in them; and is elſewhere (<hi>viz. Acts</hi> 2. 41.) taken knowledge of by the holy Ghoſt, as an Index or Signe of a true Believer: but for ſuch a Property, Diſpoſition, or Temper as this; <hi>viz.</hi> not to give or afford the <hi>word</hi> ſo received, a radication in their hearts and ſouls, ſo intimous, ſerious, and ſolid, which ſhould be ſufficient to maintaine their belief of it, and good affections to it, againſt all ſuch occurrences in the World, which may oppoſe, or attempt, either the one, or the other. For this is the nature or condition of a <hi>Stony,</hi> or <hi>Rocky</hi> ſoyle, which hath but a thin coate or covering of Mould, or Earth upon it; <hi>viz.</hi> to exhibit a ſpeedy and ſudden Spring, or Blade, from the <hi>ſeed</hi> that is ſown in it, but not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford this Blade, or <hi>ſeed,</hi> any ſuch rooting, which is ſufficient to preſerve it from ſcortching, when the Sun beats violently and for any conſiderable ſpace of time together, with his fiery Beames upon it. But as the Blade which ſprings from one and the ſame kinde of ſeed, as ſuppoſe from Wheat, or any other graine, though ſown in different, yea or contrary ſoyles, is yet of the ſame Species, or kinde, the nature of the ſoyle not changing the ſpecificall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſeed that is ſown in it, and <hi>God giving to every ſeed its own body,</hi> of what temper ſoever the ground is, where it is ſown: in like manner that Faith, which ſprings from the ſame ſeed of the Goſpell, muſt needs be of one and the ſame nature and kinde, though this ſeed be ſown in Hearts of never ſo differing a conſtitution and frame; the temper of the Heart, be it
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94900:165"/> what it will be, not being able ſpecifically to alter, either the Goſpell, or the naturall fruit iſſuing from it. And as a blade or eare of Wheat, though it be blaſted before the Harveſt, is not hereby proved not to have been a true blade or eare of wheat before it was blaſted: in like manner the withering or decay of any Mans faith, by what means or occaſion ſoever, before his death, doth not prove it to have been a falſe, counterfeit, or Hypocriticall faith, or a faith of any other kinde, then that which is true, reall, and permanent unto the end. Therefore the poſſibility of a finall defection in thoſe, who for a time truly believe, believe with the ſame kinde of Faith, whereby others, perſevering in it to the end, are ſaved, is cleerly aſſerted by the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf in the ſaid Parable: yea, there is not onely a poſſibility in this kinde aſſerted by Him, but a futurity alſo of many inſtances, wherein this poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be acted upon the great ſtage of the World.</p>
            <p>Againſt the interpretation given, and the inference drawn from the words<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> lately opened, it is commonly objected, that our Saviour in the ſecond ground (and ſo in the third) doth not ſet forth the condition of true Believers, or ſpeak of true juſtifying Faith, but of temporary Believers, and of a temporary Faith. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That if by a <hi>temporary Faith</hi> the Objectors meane, a Faith which is eventually onely ſuch, it is acknowledged that the <hi>Scripture</hi> owneth both the terme, and notion. But if by a <hi>temporary Faith,</hi> they meane, a <hi>Faith,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally, in the nature and kinde of it, differing from that which is true, and truly juſtifying, they deviſe a new kinde of Faith, which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> know not of. And of how dangerous a conſequence the introducing of an exotique <hi>Faith</hi> into the affaires of Chriſtian Religion may be, I leave to themſelves to judge.

Otherwiſe ſuch ground as this would never be ſown: nor would our Saviour have had the opportunity of furniſhing
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:94900:165"/> his Parable with the mention of that event, or ill ſucceſſe, which frequently befalleth the ſeed ſown in ſuch ground. Now if the <hi>temporarineſſe</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> we ſpeak of, was occaſioned onely <hi>ab extra,</hi> or by means accidentall and extraneous to it, evident it is that it did not ariſe from any thing in the nature or eſſence of it: and conſequently, that it was of the ſame kinde, with that <hi>Faith</hi> which did perſevere unto the end.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the <hi>temporarineſſe</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> now under conſideration, either cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> it, or declared it, to be ſpecifically diſtinct, from that which was ſound and juſtifying, and which held out to the end, then muſt perſeverance, or an impoſſibility of failing, be of the nature and eſſence of true <hi>Faith:</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is evident, and needs no proof. Now, 1. If perſeverance be of the eſſence of true <hi>Faith,</hi> no perſon can be looked upon as a <hi>true Believer,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Himſelf, or others, untill he gives up the Ghoſt, and dieth. 2. If an <hi>impoſsibility of failing</hi> be of the eſſence hereof, no Man can be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a true <hi>Believer,</hi> neither before, nor after, he be dead. For what though a Mans <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould not <hi>faile</hi> before he dieth, yet this amounts to no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof, that therefore it was <hi>impoſsible</hi> that it ſhould faile. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things come to paſſe, which yet very poſſibly might not have come to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, that Perſeverance, is not an intrinſecall or eſſentiall property of true <hi>Faith,</hi> but onely a conſequent of it, and that contingent, appears, 1. From the Principles of our Adverſaries themſelves, who commonly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the gift of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the gift of Perſeverance. <hi>Wonderfull it is</hi> (ſaith <hi>Austin) and much to be wondered at, that God ſhould, unto ſome of his Children, whom he hath regenerated in Christ, to whom he hath given</hi> FAITH<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Therefore (by the way) <hi>Auſtin</hi> is no friend to the common Doctrine of Perſeverance, as it is taught and received, amongſt us. 2. <hi>Adam</hi> (they ſay) before his <hi>fall</hi> had true <hi>Faith,</hi> or (at leaſt) a Power of believing truly, (which now they acknowledge in none, but in thoſe who truly believe) however, certaine it is that he had true holineſſe; yet the event in his fall declared that <hi>Perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> was not eſſentiall unto any of theſe; and conſequently, that in caſe he had perſevered in them, this Perſeverance had been but conſequentiall to them, and that contingently. 3. That which is true, is not wont to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or contra-diſtinguiſhed, to that which is <hi>temporary;</hi> but may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly enough be diſtinguiſhed into that which indureth for a ſeaſon, and that which continueth for ever. Therefore that which is temporary, and which ſtandeth by a Man onely for a ſhort time, may be as reall, and true in the ſame kinde, as that which continueth with him all his dayes. 4. If the <hi>Faith</hi> under diſpute, were <hi>temporary</hi> in the nature of it, and not by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence onely, then could not a <hi>falling away</hi> from it, by thoſe who were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of it, be the cauſe of their finall miſcarriage (which yet our Saviour plainely ſuppoſeth) becauſe ſhould they have perſevered in it, they ſhould not have been any whit more ſaved by it, then now they were under a <hi>falling away</hi> from it. The loſing of that, which being kept, would not have ſaved a Man, cannot be the cauſe of his loſſe of Salvation. 5. (And laſtly) if the ſaid <hi>Faith</hi> were <hi>temporary,</hi> and not true, juſtifying or ſaving, in the nature of it, then the lack of moyſture afterwards, could not be the reaſon or cauſe thereof; I mean, why it was, or proved, <hi>temporary,</hi> and not true, or ſaving. The reaſon hereof is plaine: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe what is ſo, or ſo, ſuch or ſuch; in the nature of it, cannot be made, or become ſuch, by any after means, or
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:94900:166"/> occaſion whatſoever, whether act, or neglect. But evident it is, from the expreſs words of the Parable, that the reaſon why the ſaid <hi>Faith,</hi> was, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>temporary,</hi> was becauſe the <hi>ſeed,</hi> from whence it ſprang, <hi>wanted moyſture. And ſome fell upon a Rock</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luke) and as ſoone as it was ſprung up (i. e.</hi> within a ſhort time after, as appeares, <hi>Mar. 4. 17.) it withered away, becauſe it lacked moyſture</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 8. 6.</note>. So that the <hi>withering of it away,</hi> i. e. <hi>the temporari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it,</hi> was occaſioned or cauſed by a means accidentall and extrinſecall to it, <hi>viz.</hi> the want of a thoroughneſſe or cordialneſs of affection to the Goſpell, by which the faith or belief of it now ſprung in Soule, ſhould have been fed, nouriſhed, and maintained, againſt all attempts made by <hi>perſecution</hi> to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but why are true and ſound Believers compared to the<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> 
               <hi>good ground,</hi> if they alſo were true Believers, who are reſembled by the <hi>ſtony ground?</hi> I anſwer, the reaſon hereof is plaine; <hi>viz.</hi> not becauſe the <hi>Faith</hi> in the Perſons ſignified by theſe different grounds, was different in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or kinde of it, but becauſe the iſſue or event of their reſpective <hi>Faiths</hi> differ, and this by way of ſimilitude to the different ſucceſſe or event of the ſame Corne (for kinde) growing in <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> and in <hi>good</hi> or fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be objected; that the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>no root,</hi> whereas it is evident, that the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>good ground,</hi> which perſevered, had <hi>roote.</hi> And doth not this argue a ſpecificall or eſsentiall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them? I anſwer; when the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>ſtony ground</hi> is ſaid not to have <hi>roote,</hi> the meaning cannot be that it had no <hi>root</hi> at all: for then it could not have ſprouted, or ſprung up, as it did; but that it had no conſiderable <hi>roote,</hi> no ſufficient <hi>rooting</hi> to carry it through unto the Harveſt: or, no <hi>roote</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>good ground.</hi> The ſeed that is ſown in <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> though it wants <hi>depth of Earth,</hi> and ſo muſt needs want <hi>depth</hi> of rooting, yet it hath ſome kinde of rooting proportionable to the Earth which it hath, as well as that, which is ſown in the beſt and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſoile that is. So that as a ſprout, or blade of Wheat ſown in <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> doth not differ ſpecifically from a blade of the ſame graine growing in good ground, though this hath, by the opportunity of the ſoyle, the better root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: in like manner the <hi>Faith</hi> of Him that believeth onely for a time, and afterwards declineth, may be eſſentially, and for nature, the ſame <hi>Faith</hi> with His, who perſevereth unto the end. If difference in rooting, ſhould cauſe, or prove, a ſpecificall difference between blade and blade of the ſame graine, it is like that every blade, though growing in the ſame field, or ground, would differ <hi>ſpecie</hi> from all its fellowes: in as much as it is no wayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable but that there conſtantly is ſome difference, more, or leſſe, between the reſpective <hi>rootings</hi> of every particular Corne that is ſown in the ſame Field. Yea, there is little queſtion to be made, but that ſome individualls of the ſame ſeed, ſown in the ſame ground, ſuppoſe the beſt and richeſt ground of all, may have, yea and have commonly, ſo ſlight and faint a <hi>rooting,</hi> that heat and drought will cauſe it to wither away before the Harveſt. Therefore no ſpecificall difference can be inferred between <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> from a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall difference in their <hi>rootings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be yet further objected; The <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> yeilded no<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> fruit: whereas the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>good ground,</hi> is ſaid to <hi>bring forth fruit with patience.</hi> Doth not this argue a ſpecificall difference between them? I anſwer, neither: yea thoſe very words, <hi>with patience,</hi> which are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:94900:166"/> clearly imply, that the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>ſtony ground did bring forth fruit alſo;</hi> and that it came ſhort of the <hi>good ground</hi> onely in this, that this <hi>brought forth fruit with patience. [i. e.</hi> the fruitfulneſſe of it was not extinguiſhed by any perſecutions or ſufferings from the World] whereas the fruitfulneſs of the other gave up the ghoſt through feare of ſufferings. And indeed had not this <hi>ſtony ground</hi> been ſome wayes <hi>fruitfull,</hi> and made ſuch a Profeſſion of the Goſpell, which rendreth Men obnoxious to perſecution from the World, there had been no cauſe why it ſhould either have ſuffered, or feared Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Beſides, fruitfulneſſe, and unfruitfulneſſe, make no ſpecificall or eſſentiall difference, between ſubject and ſubject, more then ſtrength and weakneſſe, ſpeech and ſilence argue one Man to differ <hi>ſpecie</hi> from another. If they did, the ſame Tree that beareth fruit one year, and is barren another, ſhould differ <hi>ſpecie</hi> from it ſelf; yea and the <hi>Faith</hi> of true Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who (according to the known ſence of our Adverſar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The laſt Objection, which I think knows how to appeare againſt the Truth<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> of the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> or Temporaries, in the Parable, is this: true <hi>Faith,</hi> ſuch as was found in thoſe reſembled by the good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>round, alwayes includes a purpoſe of heart to beare the croſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and ſuffer perſecution: But the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Temporaries wanted this property. Therefore it was not true <hi>Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but another kinde of <hi>Faith</hi> eſſentially diſtinct from it. To this alſo we anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That true <hi>Faith</hi> doth not in the preciſe or formall conception of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſuch a purpoſe of heart, as the Objection ſpeaks of: n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r can ſuch a thing be proved, either from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or from any ſound Principle of reaſon. That ſuch a purpoſe is ſeminally or vertually included in true <hi>Faith,</hi> may be granted. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſuch a purpoſe of heart was not in thoſe that are called <hi>Temporaries</hi> in the Parable, cannot be proved: there is no word, or clauſe herein, that doth import it. That they did not take up the Croſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when it lay in their way, nor endure perſecution for the Goſpell, doth not at all prove, that there was no reall purpoſe in them of doing either. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of Himſelf: <hi>to will (i. e.</hi> to purpoſe or intend) <hi>is preſent with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but how to perform that which is good, I finde not</hi>

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:94900:168"/> which little or nothing concerned them, to whom He Writes, nor much (indeed) any other Man, if the Principles and Tenents of our Adverſaries would ſtand. If true Believers be uncapable of any ſuch backſliding, which ſhould make <hi>their latter end worſe then their beginning,</hi> to what purpoſe, ſhould the Apoſtle make a large Diſcourſe unto them concerning ſuch Men, who had miſcarried by ſuch backſlidings? Or would there be, upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, any more ſavour in this Diſcourſe, then if <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould have made a journey to the Queene of <hi>Sheba's</hi> Court, to informe Her that Theeves and Murtherers were ſorely puniſhed in His Kingdome? And for Hypocrites themſelves, neither would the Diſcourſe have been of much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment unto them, in caſe ſuch a Perſonall and Peremptory Election, and Reprobation, as our Oppoſers contend for, could be with truth obtained. If I be upon ſuch termes elected, I am in no danger of falling under that heavy doome of Hypocrites, <hi>whoſe latter end is worſe then their beginning:</hi> or if I be ſo Reprobated, I am in no capacity, in no Poſſibility of redeeming my ſelfe, by the tender of any Admonitions, Cautions, Exhortations, Threatnings, or Examples whatſoever of Perſons, who have made Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of their Soules againſt the ſame Rock, before me. To what purpoſe then, be I elected, or be I Reprobated, be I a ſound Believer, or be I an Hypocrite, ſhould any application be made, either by God, or Men, unto me, either in order to my obtaining of that, which all my ſin and wickedneſſe cannot keepe from me, or for the avoiding or preventing of that, from which all my Care, Diligence, Faithfulneſſe, cannot deliver me? Therefore (queſtionleſſe) the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> all along that quarter of Diſcourſe, which we have lately had under conſideration, clearly ſuppoſeth, that even true Believers, ſuch as upon good grounds He concluded thoſe, to whom He Writes, to be, are obnoxious to ſuch an Apoſtaſie and declining, in, and from their <hi>Faith,</hi> which is accompanied with the ſignall ruine and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe, who value holineſſe, and cloſe walkings with God at no higher rate, then to caſt them behinde their back, without looking after them any more.

            </argument>
            <p>THE Opportunity which <hi>Error</hi> commonly findeth to build Her ſelf<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> a Throne amongſt Men, and to reigne over the Judgements and Conſciences of thoſe, who are debtors of Homage and Subjection to the Truth, lieth not ſo much in the ſtrength, or beauty, of thoſe Arguments or Pleas, which ſhe is able to ingage in Her cauſe, as either in the weakneſs, or negligence, of the Friends and Profeſſors of the Truth; as when they are either not able, or not induſtrious enough, to ſhew her unto the World like <hi>Solomon in all his glory,</hi> and to ſpread that light of Evidence and Conviction round about Her, which belongeth unto Her, and which would commend Her like a Daughter of God, in the Eyes of Men. Truth, whoſe native reſidence and ſeat, is (as the old Philoſophers were wont to expreſſe it) <hi>in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundo,</hi> in the depths, remote from the common thoughts and apprehenſions of Men, cannot in many Particulars, be drawn up into a clear and perfect light, but onely by a long coard well twiſted, of much labour, attentive Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, together with ſome dexterity for the Work. God Himſelf is ſaid to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit a light that is inacceſsible</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 16.</note>, that is (as I conceive) to be capable of more and more glorious attributions, or of having a greater number of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things, and things of a greater excellency, ſpoken of Him, and that with Evidence and clearneſſe of Truth, then either Men, or Angels, are able to diſcover, or comprehend; much more to utter or declare unto the World. And the Truth is, that many Truths <hi>dwell</hi> in ſuch a <hi>light,</hi> which is not <hi>acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> without much difficulty, to the Judgements and Underſtandings of Men, being onely manifeſtable in their certainty and perfect beauty, by ſuch Arguments and Conſiderations, which they muſt dig deep, who deſire to diſcover; and they look narrowly and with a <hi>ſingle Eye,</hi> who deſire to be made fully capable and ſenſible of them, being ſet before them. Whereas <hi>Error,</hi> being of neer affinity to the corrupt and dark minds and underſtandings of men, dwells <hi>in propinquo,</hi> and (as it were) at their right hand: and though Her ſervants (the reaſons I meane, which negotiate Her affaires with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Men) be all fleſh, and not ſpirit, all ſhew, and no ſubſtance; yet having the advantage of a naturall ſympathy and compliance in thoſe, with whom they have to doe, their cauſe is readily accepted, and approved as juſt and good. When the Diſciples ſaw the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> by no better light then what the night afforded, and that at a diſtance; walking upon the Sea to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, <hi>they were troubled,</hi> thinking he had been ſome uncleane <hi>ſpirit</hi> that would have deſtroyed them, <hi>and cried out for feare:</hi> but when He came neer them, and <hi>ſayd to them, Be of good comfort, it is I: be not afraid</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 14. 26, 27.</note>, they perfectly knew that it was their dear Lord and Maſter. So many looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Doctrine, which oppoſeth the un-conditioned Perſeverance of the Saints, and aſſerteth a Poſſibility of their finall fall, by the dim light of ſome ſenſuall Principles and Apprehenſions, and in an overly and ſuperficiall manner, as it were at a diſtance, are much troubled at it, as if it were a Doctrine of an Anti-evangelicall ſpirit, that would bring them into a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of fear, and torment them. Which Doctrine notwithſtanding, would they look upon it narrowly, and with an unprejudiced attention, and this by
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:94900:169"/> the clear light of ſuch conſiderations, which exhibit it like it ſelf unto them, they would then ſoon confeſſe to be a Doctrine, which was ſet, not at all to curſe, but to bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſs them altogether.</p>
            <p>The ſole undertaking of this Chapter is to commend the ſaid Doctrine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>Argum. 1.</hi>
               </note> the Judgements and Conſciences of Men, for a Truth, by a Propoſall of ſuch worthy things which relate to it, either by way of cauſality, or affinity in Truth. In the firſt place I pleade the cordiall ſympathy it hath with that righteouſneſs of God, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or a non-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of Perſons, thus:</p>
            <p>That Doctrine which rendereth God free from that unrighteouſneſs, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls a reſpecting the Perſons of Men, is a Doctrine of perfect conſiſtency with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the Truth.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine which teacheth a Poſſibility of the Saints declining, and this unto death, is a Doctrine of this import. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon of the former Propoſition, is plaine: in as much as the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> frequently aſſert that Principle, of non-reſpecting Perſons, moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>the judge of all the Earth,</hi> unto God. <hi>Deut. 10. 17.

Evident it is that the Doctrine here ſpoken of, repreſenteth God, as a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpecter of Perſons,</hi> in as much as it rendreth him a Judge of the ſame righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeverity againſt the enormous tranſgreſſions of his own Children and Friends, which he exerciſeth towards his enemies, and thoſe that are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers unto Him, upon the like Provocations. This Doctrine ſubjecteth Saints, as well as others, to this righteous Law of God: <hi>Neither Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with Mankinde, nor The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9.</note>; meaning (as is evident from other <hi>Scriptures</hi>) without Repentance. Whereas the common Doctrine of Perſeverance, exempteth all ſuch, who have at any time been true Believers, or Children of God, from the penalty or doome of this Law; teaching, that though ſuch as theſe ſhould turne <hi>Fornicators, Idolaters, Adulterers, &amp;c.</hi> and continue never ſo long in theſe abominations, without Repentance, yet they retaine their Right and Title of Inheritance in the Kingdome of God, and that they remaine under the greateſt love, that God can ſhew, or beare towards Men, the love of Election and of Children, even in the midſt of theſe deep and deſperate Provocations. And thus it maketh God the greateſt accepter of Perſons in the World, rendring Him implacably ſevere towards leſſer ſinners, and indulgent above meaſure to the greater. For that ſuch, who have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or have had the knowledge of God, and have believed in Jeſus <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and made Profeſſion of love and ſervice to Him, when they turn <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, Idolaters, Adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. are far greater ſinners, then Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ſame ſins <hi>in ignorance and unbeliefe,</hi> is (I think) no Mans doubt or queſtion. Certaine I am that the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſtill repreſenteth God as more ſevere in puniſhing, where greater means of Righteouſneſſe and well doing have been vouchſafed. <hi>You</hi> (ſaid He to His own People, <hi>the Children of Iſrael,</hi> of old) <hi>onely have I knowne of all the Families of the Earth: Therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Am. 3. 2.</note>. In the Goſpell: <hi>And that ſervant which knew His Lords will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to His Will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.

               <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 12. 47, 48.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It cannot be denied (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:94900:169"/> it is by our Adverſaries themſelves, as hath been formerly obſerved) but that true Believers, have fallen into the Practiſe of the foule tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mentioned, yea and have remained impenitent in them for a long ſeaſon. Therefore if during the time of ſuch Practiſe and impenitency, they ſhould not be in the ſame, or worſe condition to God-ward, and Salvation-wiſe, then ignorant Perſons, and ſuch who were alwayes ſtrangers unto God, are, when they live in the ſame impieties, God muſt needs be <hi>an accepter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> in the higheſt, and ſhew a thouſand times more favour to grand and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Delinquents, then to ordinary and lighter Offendors, (in compariſon.) So that to pretend, though true Believers, may, and oft doe, fall into the fore-named ſins, and continue for a time in them without Repentance, yet God alwayes reneweth them by Repentance before their death (though this was never yet proved, nor ever will be) it doth not at all ſalve the honour of the ſaid Doctrine. Becauſe ſuch a ſuppoſall notwithſtanding, the Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about, may, and doe, according to the tenor of the Premiſes lately Proved, ſuffer a totall eclipſe and interciſion of the grace and favour of God, in the mean ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for a Poſſibility of the Saints defection, either totall, finall, or<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> both, I thus argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the common Doctrine of Perſeverance, rendereth the Ministry of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>2</label> 
               <hi>ſo far as it concerneth the Perſeverance of the Saints, vaine, impertinent, and voyd, then is it not a Doctrine of God, but of Men: and conſequently, that which oppoſeth it is the Truth. But certaine it is, that the ſaid Doctrine is of this un-Christian tendency and import:</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>The conſequence in the Major Propoſition is pregnant of truth: in as much as the Preſervation of the Saints in Faith and Holineſſe unto the end, is one of the moſt conſiderable ends of the Miniſtry of the Goſpell, about the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting whereof it is mainly converſant. Therefore if God, who hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Miniſtry of the Goſpell for the advancement of this end, ſhould aſſert any ſuch Doctrine, which rendereth it unneceſſary and impertinent in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this end, He ſhould be divided in Himſelf, and pull down with one hand, what He buildeth up with another.</p>
            <p>The Minor Propoſition is demonſtrable, thus: That Doctrine which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the labour and faithfulneſſe of a Miniſter in preſſing ſuch Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Threatnings, and Promiſes, which tend to the Preſervation of the Saints in Faith and Holineſſe unto the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uſeleſſe, rendereth the Miniſtry of the Goſpell, as far as it concerns the incouragement or inabling of the Saints to Perſevere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> needleſs and vaine: but guilty of ſuch a tendency as this, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly-received Doctrine of Perſeverance. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth of the Major Propoſition here, ſhineth clearly enough with its own light: or however, there is this Reaſon for it; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe Miniſters of the Goſpell can have little elſe from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but only Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Threatnings, and Promiſes, whereby to build, or effect the Perſeverance of the Saints. Therefore if the preſſing, or putting on of theſe upon Men, be needleſſe in Reference to ſuch an end; certainly their Miniſtry, as far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to this end, is needleſs alſo.</p>
            <p>The Minor is thus Proved: The common Doctrine of Perſeverance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth and commandeth all Saints, or true Believers, to be fully perſwaded, and this with the greateſt and moſt indubitable certainty of Faith, that there is an abſolute and utter impoſſibility, either of a totall, or finall defection of their Faith: and that though they ſhould fall into ten thouſand enormous
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:94900:170"/> and moſt abominable ſins, and lie wallowing in them, like a Swine in the mire, yet they ſhall remaine all the while in an eſtate of grace, and that God will by a ſtrong hand of irreſiſtible Grace, bring them off from their ſins by Repentance, before they die. But that Doctrine, which requireth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all this, and much more of like import<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be confidently believed by true Believers, rendreth the preſſing of all Exhortations, Threatnings, Promiſes, upon them, in order to prevaile with them, or to make them careful, to Perſevere, bootleſs and unneceſſary. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> in this Syllogiſme, is the knowne voyce of the common Doctrine of Perſeverance. The Reaſon of the <hi>Minor,</hi> is, becauſe a certaine knowledge and perſwaſion that God will by an irreſiſtible hand of Power preſerve a Man in the ſtate of Grace, how deſperately careleſſe, negligent, or wicked ſoever he ſhall be, clearly diſſolves the uſefulneſſe and neceſſity of all other means whatſoever in Reference to this end. If I know certainly, that the Corne, which I have ſown in my Field, will, whether I wake, or ſleepe, grow and proſper, would it not be a very impertinent addreſſe for any Man to come to me, and admoniſh me in a ſerious and grave manner, to take heed I ſleepe not, but keep my ſelf waking, leaſt my Corne ſhould not grow, or proſper? or, that it may grow and proſper? If my Corne grows, thrives, and proſpers, by the irreſiſtible Hand of God in the courſe of His naturall and ſtanding Providence; my watchfulneſſe, in order to a Procurement of theſe things, is abſolutely vaine. This is a truth, which prejudice and partiality themſelves cannot lightly but ſubſcribe; <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no Force, Power, or Authority in ſuch an Exhortation, wherein we are preſſed to uſe means, either for the avoyding or eſcaping of ſuch a danger, which we are upon ſure grounds perſwaded cannot poſſibly fall upon us; or for the performance of what we are aſſured upon the like terms of certainty, that we cannot but performe, or that God Himſelf will certainly by any irreſiſtible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruſtrable hand of grace, performe and work in us. So againe; that there is no efficacy or power in ſuch a threatning, which threatneth us with ſuch an evill or danger, which we infallibly know our ſelves out of all poſſibility of ſuffering, or falling under. And laſtly, that there is no weight, or quickening Power in ſuch a Promiſe, wherein only ſuch a benefit or bleſſing, is promiſed unto us upon the performance of a condition, which we infallib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know to be ours, before the condition be performed, yea and which we are<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> moſt certainly aſſured we ſhall not, we cannot, upon any terms whatſoever, be deprived of.</p>
            <p>That which is commonly pleaded to ſalve the conſiſtency of the common Doctrine of peremptorily-decreed Perſeverance, with an uſefulneſſe, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, of the Exhortations, Threatnings, and Promiſes mentioned, hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any logicall, nor theologicall vertue in it for ſuch a purpoſe. For, is it any other, then this; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Exhortations, comminations, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which we ſpeak of, are means appointed by God (and uſed by him accordingly) for the accompliſhment and effecting of that Perſeverance in the Saints, which he hath made ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary by his decree? Now that ſuch a notion as this is altogether irrelative to the buſineſs, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation whereof it pretendeth, will be made evident, by weighing the particulars ſeverally.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the Exhortations, wherein the Saints are exhorted unto Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, are no means, by which the Promiſes of Perſeverance, made (as our Adverſaries ſuppoſe) unto them, are accompliſhed, or effected, is thus
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:94900:170"/> clearly evinced, <hi>Whatſoever is a meanes for the bringing of any thing to paſſe, ought not to containe any thing in it repugnant or contrary unto that, which is intended to be brought to paſſe by it.</hi> For meanes ought to be ſubordinate to their ends, not Repugnant. <hi>But the Scripture exhortations unto Perſeverance containe that which is repugnant to the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>miſes of Perſeverance,</hi> if ſuppoſed ſuch, as our Adverſaries ſuppoſe them to be. Therefore they can be no means to effect theſe Promiſes. The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident by the light of this conſideration. Such Exhortations as theſe, unto the Saints, <hi>Take he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d leſt at any time there be an evill heart of unbeliefe in you, leſt you be hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin, lest you fall from Grace, leſt you receive the Grace of God in vaine, leſt you fall from your own ſtedfastneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> in their native and proper tendency import a danger, and ſerve to raiſe a feare in Men, leſt the danger imported ſhould come upon them. Whereas ſuch Promiſes as theſe made unto the ſame Perſons, and that unconditionally (as is ſuppoſed) that there ſhall never be an heart of unbeliefe in you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you ſhall never be hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin, that you ſhall never fall away from the Grace of God, &amp;c. exclude all danger, yea or poſſibility, of falling away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tend directly to prevent or extinguiſh all fear in Men of any ſuch danger. Therefore ſuch exhortations are in their very natures and genuine import, contrary to ſuch promiſes, in theirs: and conſequently, can be no means of bringing them to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, if ſuch exhortations as we ſpeak of, be a means to effect that Perſeverance, which our Adverſaries ſuppoſe to be promiſed unto the Saints, then muſt the act of Perſeverance in the Saints, neceſſarily depend upon them, ſo as that it cannot, or will not, take place, or be effected, without them, <hi>i. e.</hi> without the Saints ſubmitting of themſelves unto them. But perſevering upon theſe terms, clearly ſuppoſeth a Poſſibility of a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſevering. For whatſoever dependeth upon a mutable condition and which poſſibly may not be performed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may it ſelf as poſsibly never come to paſſe.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the ſaid <hi>Exhortations</hi> are means of the Saints Perſevering,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> in this reſpect; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe God by His Spirit irreſiſtibly, or infruſtrably, drawes, and perſwades the Saints to obey theſe Exhortations, as means of their perſevering; I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot be proved that God doth draw, or perſwade his Saints upon any ſuch terms, to obey theſe exhortations. Nay frequent experience ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and our Adverſaries own Doctrine (frequently mentioned) expreſly granteth, that the Saints many times are ſo far from obeying theſe Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that they walke for a long time in full oppoſition to them, as in ſecurity, looſeneſſe, vile Practiſes, &amp;c. Nor have they yet proved, nor (I believe) ever will prove, but that they may walke, yea and that many, have thus walked, (I mean, in full oppoſition to the ſaid Exhortations) to their dying day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If God by his Spirit irreſiſtibly drawes his Saints to obey the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations we ſpeak of, he thus draweth them, either by ſuch a force or Power immediately acted upon their wills, by which they are made willing to obey them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe he maketh uſe of the ſaid Exhortations ſo to work, or affect their wills, that they become willing accordingly. If the former be aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſaid Exhortations are no means, whereby the Perſeverance of the Saints is effected, but God alone, and immediately, by His Spirit. For if the Will be immediately affected by God after ſuch a manner, or brought to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:94900:171"/> ſuch a bent and inclination, as that it cannot but obey the ſaid Exhortations, <hi>i. e.</hi> doe the things, which the ſaid Exhortations require, then would it have done the ſame things, whether there had been any ſuch Exhortations in being, or no; and conſequently, theſe Exhortations could have no manner of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency about their Perſeverance. For the will (according to the common ſaying) is (of it ſelf) <hi>caeca potentia, a blind faculty,</hi> and followes its own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant bent and inclination, without taking knowledge whether the wayes or actions, towards which it ſtands bent, be commanded, or exhorted unto by God, or no.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the will of a Saint be immediately ſo affected by God, that it ſtands inclin'd and bent to doe the things, which are proper to cauſe them to Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, then is this bent and inclination wrought in the will of ſuch a Perſon, after his being a Saint; and conſequently is not eſſentiall to him as a Saint, but meerly accidentall and adventitious. And if ſo, then is there no inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or bent in the will of a Saint, as ſuch, or from his firſt being a Saint, to Perſevere, or to do the things, which accompany Perſeverance; but they come to be wrought in him afterwards. Which how conſiſtent it is with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, either of Reaſon, or Religion, or their own, I am content that my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries themſelves ſhall judge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If God doth immediately and irreſiſtibly incline, or move, the wills of the Saints to doe the things which accompany Perſeverance, the ſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations can be no means of effecting this Perſeverance. For the will being Phyſically and irreſiſtibly acted and drawn by God to doe ſuch and ſuch things, needeth no addition of morall means, ſuch as Exhortations are (if they be any) in order hereunto. What a Man is neceſſitated unto, he needeth no further help or means to doe it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And laſtly, for this) the things which accompany Perſeverance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a continuance in Faith and Love unto the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If then the wills of the Saints be immediately and irreſiſtibly moved by God thus to continue (I mean, in Faith and Love) unto the end, what place is there for Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come in with their efficiency, towards their Perſeverance? Need they be exhorted to continue in Faith and Love, or to Perſevere, after the end? Thus then we clearly ſee that the former of the two conſequences men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, cannot ſtand. God doth not by His Spirit irreſiſtibly draw or move the wills of the Saints to doe the things, which are neceſſary for the procuring their Perſeverance, immediately, or without the inſtrumentall interpoſure of the ſaid exhortations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, neither can the latter of the ſaid conſequences ſtand, God doth<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> not make uſe of the ſaid Exhortations to influence or affect the wills of the Saints upon any ſuch terms, as hereby to make them infallibly, infruſtrably, neceſſitatingly willing to Perſevere, or to doe the things upon which Perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance dependeth. For,</p>
            <p>1. If ſo, then one and the ſame act of the will, ſhould be both Phyſicall, and morall; and ſo be ſpecifically diſtinguiſhed, in, and from it ſelf. For ſo far as it is produced by the irreſiſtible force or power of the Spirit of God, it muſt needs be Phyſicall, the ſaid irreſiſtible working of the Spirit being a Phyſicall action, and ſo not proper to produce a morall effect. Againe, as far as the ſaid Exhortations are means to produce or raiſe this act of the will, or contribute any thing towards it, it muſt needs be morall; becauſe Exhortations are morall cauſes, and ſo not capable of producing naturall, phyſicall, or neceſſary effects. Now then if it be unpoſſible that one and the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94900:171"/> ſame act of the will ſhould be, both phyſicall, and morall, that is, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> neceſſary, unpoſſible alſo it is, that it ſhould be produced, by the irreſiſtible Working of God, and by Exhortations, in a joynt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie.</p>
            <p>It may be objected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They who hold, or grant ſuch an influence, or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit of God upon the will, which is fruſtrable and reſiſtible, doe, or muſt ſuppoſe it, to be a phyſicall action, as well as that, which is irreſiſtible. If ſo, then the act of the will, ſo far as it is raiſed by means of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his action, or operation of God, muſt, according to the tenor of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer argument, be phyſicall alſo: and ſo the pretended impoſſibility is no more avoided by this Opinion, then by the other. I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Though ſuch an operation of God upon the will, as is here mentioned, be, in reſpect of God, and of the manner of its proceeding from Him, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall, yet in reſpect of the nature and ſubſtance of it, it is properly morall, becauſe it impreſſeth or affecteth the will, upon which it is acted, after the manner of morall cauſes properly ſo called, <hi>i. e.</hi> perſwadingly, not Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhingly, or neceſsitatingly. When a Miniſter of the Goſpell, in his Preaching, Preſſeth or Perſwadeth Men to ſuch and ſuch duties, or actions, this act as it proceedeth from Him, I meane, as it is raiſed by His naturall abilities, of underſtanding and ſpeaking, is phyſicall or naturall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; but in reſpect of the ſubſtance or native tendency of it, it is clearly morall, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it tendeth to incline or move the wills of Men to ſuch or ſuch electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without neceſsitating them hereunto: and ſo comports with thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments or Exhortations, in their manner of efficiency, by which he preſſeth or moveth them to ſuch things. By the way, to prevent ſtumbling, and quarrelling, it no wayes followeth from the Premiſſes, that a Miniſter by his Preaching, and perſwading unto duties, ſhould doe as much as God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth, in, or towards a perſwading of Men hereunto. It onely followeth, that the Miniſter doth <hi>co-operate</hi> with God (which the Apoſtle Him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

For when one neceſsitates, and another onely perſwades, they cannot be ſaid to <hi>co-operate,</hi> or to worke the one with the other. No more then two, when the one runs, and the other walks a ſoft pace, can be ſaid to go or walk together. But when two perſwade to one and the ſame action, one may perſwade more eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctually by many degrees, then the other; may have a peculiar Act or Method of perſwading, above the other.</p>
            <p>But it may be further objected; If that Act of God, by which he affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> or moveth the wills of Men, be in any conſideration, phyſicall, muſt it not thus far, and in this reſpect, have a phyſicall effect aſſignable unto it? If ſo, what effect of this kinde can we aſsigne unto that Act of His we ſpeak of, unleſſe it be the determining or neceſsitating of the will to that action, or courſe, whereunto it is moved by it? I anſwer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. They who make the Act of God, inquired after in this demand, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſolely phyſicall, doe not ſuppoſe the effect, which they aſcribe to it; I meane, the neceſsitating of the will to that election, whereunto it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, to be a phyſicall effect, but morall; affirming (but with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, either with Reaſon, or Truth, I underſtand not) that the will, though neceſsitated by God, is yet free in her election of that, whereunto ſhe is ſo neceſsitated; whereby they conceive the morality of the action ſalved. But,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:94900:172"/>2. The Phyſicall or neceſſary effect, which anſwers that Phyſicall act, or efficiencie of God upon the will, (now under conſideration) is that incline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or moving impreſsion towards ſuch or ſuch an election, which is acted upon the will by this act of His, together with the perſwading force or weight of the Exhortation, wherein, or wherewith, he ſo inclineth it, or at leaſt attempteth to incline it. Thus far, and in this ſence, it is granted, that the Act of God, whereby he inclines or moves the wills of Men, either to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or to Perſevere believing, is irreſiſtible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or infruſtrable, <hi>i. e.</hi> Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder, or prevent thoſe moving impreſſions unto good, in one kinde or other, which God is pleaſed at any time to impart unto them, or to act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their wills; though they may hinder and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3.

If a Father ſhould firſt promiſe with the greateſt aſſureance he could give, or make, that he would make his Son his heir, and beſtow his inheritance upon him, yea and ſhould earneſtly preſſe and perſwade this Son of his to believe and expect as much from him, would it not be very incongruous, (or rather indeed, ridiculous) for this Father, afterwards to exhort, admoniſh, entreat, and beſeech this his Son, that he would take heed that he loſe not the inheritance aſſured, [<hi>i. e.</hi> made paſt loſing] unto him? Indeed if this Father ſhould onely purpoſe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though with a purpoſe abſolutely unchangeable, to make his Son his Heire, and not declare his purpoſe in this behalf unto his Son, it might be ſomewhat prudentiall in him, to admoniſh and exhort his Son to behave Himſelf ſo, that the inheritance may not be given away from him. But thus to exhort, or admoniſh him, after a Declaration made to him, that he is unchangeably reſolved to make him his heire, would be to ſend him into a far Country to fetch that, which he certainly knows, before he goes, is at home. In like manner, if it ſhall be ſuppoſed, that God hath no where abſolutely promiſed Perſeverance unto the Saints, though it ſhould be ſuppoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that his intent is to work it with a ſtrong and irreſiſtible hand in them, there were ſome face of Reaſon in it, that he ſhould ſeriouſly admoniſh, and exhort them to perſevere (though the truth is, that even ſuch a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as this, upon due inquiry, will hardly be found a diſpenſation wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God; I meane, to exhort Men to doe that, which he intends by a

            <p n="1">1.

And the Reaſon why God ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter, that the ſhip ſhould be wreck'd and loſt, notwithſtanding all the means uſed to preſerve it, was, that they who went along with <hi>Paul</hi> in it, might plainly know and underſtand, not onely that their Preſervation was from God, and that more then in an ordinary way, but that it was vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to them upon ſuch terms, for his ſervant <hi>Pauls</hi> ſake, who was amongſt them: which they could not ſo well have underſtood, had the ſhip come whole and ſafe into Harbor.

            <p>If it be ſaid, that they might as well think ſuch a thought as this, upon that<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> eſcape which they did make at laſt, <hi>ſome by ſwimming, others by laying hold on planks, and broken peeces of the ſhip, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, No: For when, 1. They had a freſh experiment that they could not by all their diligence and skill eſcape ſhipwrack, but that this, according to <hi>Pauls</hi> word had befaln them: And 2. ſaw, that they we caſt upon an Iſland, which <hi>Paul</hi> alſo had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them; And 3. (and laſtly) that now they were all come ſafe to Land, as <hi>Paul</hi> had likewiſe pre-aſſured them they ſhould, and that by way of a gratuity unto him, according to his expreſſion unto them, Verſ. 24. <hi>And lo, God hath given</hi> THEE <hi>all them that ſail with thee;</hi> they could not lightly but apprehend, and conclude, that the preſervation and ſafety of their lives was not the atchievement or reward of their own labor or skill, but a ſpecial benefit or bleſſing vouchſafed unto them by God, for his Servant <hi>Pauls</hi> ſake. By this diſcourſe it appears, how, and upon what terms, thoſe words of <hi>Paul,</hi> Verſ. 31. <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip, ye cannot be ſafe,</hi> accord with the Promiſe of God made unto him concerning the ſafety of all that were in the ſhip with him. The purport of the Promiſe was this, that the ſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wreck'd and broken, they ſhould all eſcape with their lives, becauſe God had given them unto <hi>Paul; i. e.</hi> had purpoſed to honor <hi>Paul,</hi> by ſparing or preſerving them in ſo eminent a danger. This Promiſe was fulfilled and made good, when, the ſhip being broken, they came all ſafe to Land. Therefore when ſome of the Mariners went about to leave the ſhip, before it was broken, the Apoſtle told the Centurion and the Souldiers, that they took a courſe to deprive both themſelves, and them, of that Hope and certainty of Preſervation, which God had promiſed unto Him, and He declared unto them: in as much as the intent of that Promiſe was, that they ſhould all be preſerved, in caſe they all continued in the ſhip, until it ſhould be broken. So that in caſe any of them ſhould leave the ſhip, before it was broken, and attempt their ſafety in any other way, they left no opportunity, or poſſibility unto God to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:94900:173"/> perform the ſaid Promiſe unto any of them, in as much as this Promiſe did not aſſert the ſafety of any one, or of any leſſer number of them, apart from the reſt, but of the whole and intire number of them, and that in caſe they ſhould be all found together in the ſhip, when it ſhould ſuffer wreck, and be broken. Nor can there any other Reaſon be given, why <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip, ye cannot be ſafe,</hi> but onely bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For that their <hi>abiding in the ſhip</hi> (being compelled hereunto by the Centurion and Souldiers) was any inſtrumental means of their ſafety, no where appears, nor is it any ways probable: we do not finde that they aſſiſted any of thoſe, whoſe lives were preſerved, in, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Preſervation of them; but that every man ſhifted for himſelf, and took the beſt courſe he could for his ſafety.

And of this ſafety (as hath been ſhewed) they had been uncapable, in caſe any one of the company had left the ſhip, before it was broken.</p>
            <p>Other <hi>Scriptures</hi> there are, by which the Teachers of unconditioned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> conceive they are able to prove a rational conſiſtency between an abſolute Promiſe of Perſeverance, and an Exhortation hereunto.

It is one thing to ſay, and teach, that God will ſo limit, as well the force, as the continuance, of Temptations, that the Saints MAY BE ABLE <hi>to bear them:</hi> another, to make a Promiſe of abſolute Perſeverance. Yea, thoſe very words, <hi>that ye may be able to bear it,</hi> clearly import, that all that is here promiſed unto the beleeving <hi>Corinths,</hi> is a ſufficiency of means to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, if they will improve them accordingly, not an infallible certainty of their Perſeverance. And that Caveat, <hi>Let Him that thinketh that He ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, take heed, &amp;c.</hi> plainly ſuppoſeth a poſſibility of His <hi>falling,</hi> who <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> [upon the beſt Terms and Grounds for His Thought] that He <hi>ſtandeth</hi> ſure. For that this Caveat is not given to Hypocrites, or unſound Beleevers, or unto ſuch, who pleaſe themſelves with a looſe and groundleſs conceit of the goodneſs of their condition God ward, is evident; becauſe it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſuch men ſhould <hi>fall</hi> [from their preſent <hi>ſtanding</hi> in a groundleſs conceit] then continue their <hi>ſtanding:</hi> nor would the Apoſtle ever have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſuch, to take heed of <hi>falling,</hi> whoſe condition was more like to be made better, then worſe, by their <hi>falling.</hi> And beſides, to underſtand the ſaid Caveat, of looſe Beleevers, overthrows the pertinency of it to their cauſe, who inſiſt upon it, to prove a due conſiſtency between Exhortations to Perſeverance, and Promiſes of Perſeverance, as is evident. If then it be directed to true and ſound Beleevers, it clearly ſuppoſeth a poſſibility (at leaſt) of their <hi>falling,</hi> in caſe they ſhall not <hi>take heed:</hi> otherwiſe their <hi>taking heed</hi> would be no means (at leaſt, no neceſſary means) of their <hi>ſtanding:</hi> and further, it ſuppoſeth alſo a poſſibility (at leaſt) of their <hi>non-taking heed,</hi> or that they might poſſibly not <hi>take heed</hi> hereof: otherwiſe the Caveat, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition had been in vain. Men have no need of being admoniſhed to do that, which they are under no poſſibility to omit. If then the <hi>ſtanding,</hi> or perſevering of the Saints, depends upon their <hi>taking heed leſt they fall;</hi> and their <hi>taking heed</hi> in this kinde, be ſuch a thing which they may poſſibly omit, evident it is, that there is a poſſibility of their non perſevering.

            <p>What we have aſſerted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and proved at large, concerning Exhortations<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> unto Perſeverance, (<hi>viz.</hi> that theſe are diſ-ſenced by ſuch promiſes of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, as are commonly formed in the Minds, and Writings of Men a mongſt us) we ſhall now (with what brevity we can) ſhew concerning ſuch comminations, or threatnings alſo, wherein God threatneth all thoſe with eternall Death, who ſhall not perſevere; and ſhall prove, that theſe alſo are infatuated, and rendered unſavoury, by the Principles of the ſaid Doctrine, or at leaſt uſeleſſe and vain, in reſpect of any efficiency contributable by them towards the effecting of Perſeverance in the Saints. This I demonſtrate by the light of this Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Principles of the Doctrine we ſpeak of, diſſolve the efficiency of the ſaid threatnings, towards the end, for the accompliſhing whereof they are given, then they render them unſavoury, uſeleſſe, and vaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Principles of this Doctrine are guilty of this offence. Ergo.</hi> The terms of the Major Propoſition are ſufficient witneſſes of the Truth thereof. In order to the proof of the Minor, we ſuppoſe, 1. (That which is evi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dent enough) <hi>viz.</hi> that the end intended by God, in ſuch threatnings, which threaten thoſe that ſhall Apoſtatize, with eternall Death, is to prevent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy in the Saints, and to work, or cauſe, them to Perſevere. 2. That this is one of the Principles of the common Doctrine of Perſeverance; <hi>God</hi> hath abſolutely promiſed finall Perſeverance unto the Saints: and this ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>God</hi> will certainly, infruſtrably, and infallibly work this Perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:94900:175"/> in the Saints. Theſe two things onely ſuppoſed, the light of the truth of the ſaid Minor Propoſition breakes forth from between them, with much evidence and power. For, 1. If the ſaid threatnings be intended by <hi>God,</hi> for the prevention of Apoſtaſie in the Saints (and conſequently, to effect their Perſeverance) the way, or manner, wherein this end, intended by <hi>God,</hi> is to be effected by them, muſt needs be by their ingenerating or raiſing a feare or apprehenſion in the Saints, of eternall death; it being the native property of feare, mixed with Hope, to awaken and provoke Men to the uſe of ſuch meanes, which are proper to prevent the danger, or evill feared. There is no other way imaginable, how, or wherein the Threatnings we ſpeak of, ſhould operate towards the Perſeverance of the Saints, or the prevention of their Apoſtaſie, but that mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> by working in them a feare or dread of the evill Threatened. Therefore, 2. Evident it is, that ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made, and made known, unto the Saints, by which they are made unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any ſuch feare, are abſolutely deſtructive of that efficiency, which is proper to the ſaid Threatenings, to exhibite towards the prevention of Apoſtaſie in the Saints, or for the cauſing of them to perſevere. 3. And laſtly, it is every whit as evident, that ſuch promiſes, wherein <hi>God</hi> ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Saints that they ſhall not Apoſtatize, but perſevere, are apt and proper to render them uncapable of all feare of eternall Death: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, are apparantly obſtructive of, and deſtructive unto, the native tendency and operativeneſſe of the ſaid Threatenings, towards, and about the perſeverance of the Saints. Theſe Threatnings can doe nothing, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute nothing, towards the perſeverance of the Saints, but by the mediation of the feare of evill in them, upon their non-perſevering. Therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hardens them from this fear, or renders them uncapable of it, ſuperſedes all the vertue and vigor, which are to be found in theſe threatenings, for, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the effecting of their perſeverance.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the intent of <hi>God</hi> in the threatenings we ſpeak of, is not<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> to draw the Saints by fear of the puniſhment, or evill threatened, to doe the things which accompany perſeverance, but that they are moved and drawn hereunto, by a more Heavenly principle, as <hi>viz.</hi> the pure and meere love of <hi>God;</hi> I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By demanding, what other intent can it be imagined that <hi>God</hi> ſhould have in the threatenings ſpecified, but onely that aſſerted? Evident it is (as was lately obſerved) that they are not directed unto Hypocrites, or unſound Believers: theſe are not threatened with the loſſe of Salvation, or with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Death, in caſe they ſhall not Perſevere unto the end. They are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loſing the one, and gaining the other, by perſevering [in the way they are in] unto the end, not by non perſevering, or by departing from it. Beſides, Hypocrites and counterfeit Believers, being at preſent in a ſtate of wrath, and in a way of periſhing, it is no wayes agreeable with the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that He ſhould threaten them with periſhing, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſuch a ſin, under the guilt whereof they were never like to come. And evident it is from, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. &amp; 9. and ſo from, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27. 29. and other places, that ſuch threatenings, as are now under conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were directed and adminiſtred unto ſuch, as were at preſent true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and in a ſtate of life. If then the threatnings we ſpeak of, be directed by God unto true and ſound Believers, it muſt conſequently be conceived, that they were directed unto them for good, or with an intent on Gods Part, to accommodate and bleſſe them, in one kinde, or other. <hi>I will heare</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:94900:175"/> 
               <hi>David) what God the Lord will ſpeak: for He will ſpeak peace unto His People, and to His Saints: but let them not</hi> [or, that they may not: See <hi>Piſcator</hi> upon the place] <hi>turne againe unto folly</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 85. 8.</note>. <hi>He will ſpeak peace unto His People, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> He will ſpeak onely ſuch things, which have a proper and kindly tendency to doe them good, and to procure their <hi>Peace</hi> and welfare. If ſo, then muſt the threatnings we ſpeak of, be, in reſpect of the intentions of God, of a gracious import unto Believers, to whom (as hath been ſaid) they are adminiſtred. Which gracious import cannot be conceived to ſtand in any other thing, but onely in that powerfull aptneſſe, which is ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly viſible in the ſaid threatnings, to cauſe the Perſons, to whom they are directed, through feare of the ſore evill threatened, to bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; how, and by what means they may eſcape it, and to ingage them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in the uſe of them; there being no Vertue, Property, or Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in theſe threatnings to affect, or work upon thoſe, whom they concern, in any other way, then this. From whence it clearly followes, that it is no wayes unworthy the greateſt Saints, or ſoundeſt Believers under Heaven, to act in order to their Salvation, out of a Principle of fear, leſt by their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, they ſhould deprive themſelves of ſo unvaluable a treaſure; in as much as in ſuch a courſe and method of acting, as this, they conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that gracious counſel and advice, which God out of his ſignal love, and care over them, hath recommended unto them. And upon theſe very terms our Saviour expreſſeth Himſelf to His Apoſtles, who were Saints of the higheſt elevation, and the firſt born of His delight: <hi>And I ſay unto you</hi> MY FRIENDS, <hi>be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that, have no more that they can do: But I will forewarn you whom you ſhall</hi> FEAR: FEAR HIM, <hi>which, after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell: yea, I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you,</hi> FEAR HIM <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 12. 4, 5.</note>. Therefore certainly it is no ways unlawful, no nor matter of diſparagement or diſhonor in the leaſt, to the greateſt <hi>Friends,</hi> or Lovers of God, and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to act righteouſly, out of a Principle of <hi>Fear</hi> of being <hi>caſt into Hell</hi> by God for unrighteouſneſs. That pronoun Relative, who, or <hi>which</hi> [WHICH, <hi>after He hath killed, &amp;c.</hi>] is not ſo much deſcriptive in the ſentence, as ratiocinative, or cauſal; <hi>i. e.</hi> it imports the reaſon or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of that counſel, which our Saviour here gives His Diſciples of <hi>Fearing God,</hi> to be His <hi>Power of caſting in Hell.</hi> Which is further manifeſt, by the force of the ſame Particle in the oppoſite clauſe of the Paſſage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of them,</hi> WHICH, <hi>or who, kill the body, &amp;c.</hi> Our Saviours intent in theſe words, was not ſo much to deſcribe thoſe, whom He would not have His Diſciples to <hi>Fear, viz.</hi> men; but to aſſign a Ground or Reaſon why they<note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. Though the Saints and true Beleevers, do many things, and ſhould do<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> more, out of a Principle of love to God; yet are they not bound to wave, or decline the influence, or aſſiſtance of other Principles, which incline and lead them to the ſame actions and ways with the love of God. For in this caſe alſo, that of <hi>Solomon</hi> is true: <hi>Two are better then one; becauſe they have a good reward for their labor. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow—and if one

               <note n="a" place="margin">Eccleſ. 4 9, 10, &amp;c.</note>, &amp;c. The fear of evil threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is as natural and genuine a fruit of Faith, as love it ſelf: yea, and of very choyce acceptance with God. <hi>By Faith</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Noah being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet,</hi> MOVED WITH FEAR, <hi>prepared an Ark for the ſaving of His Houſe, by the which He condemned the World, and became Heir of the Righteouſneſs, which is by Faith</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Hebr. 11. 7.</note>. So that men may <hi>condemn the World,</hi> and <hi>ſave</hi> themſelves and others, as well by actions done out of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Fear, as of Love. <hi>Becauſe thine Heart was tender</hi> (ſaid God to King <hi>Joſiah</hi> by <hi>Huldah</hi> the Propheteſs) <hi>and thou haſt humbled thy ſelf before the Lord, when thou heardſt what I ſpake againſt this place, and againſt the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that they ſhould become a deſolation and a curſe, and haſt rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I alſo have</hi> HEARD THEE, SAITH THE LORD. <hi>Behold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will gather thee to thy Fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered into thy grave in peace</hi>

Yea,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) the preſent ſtate, and frame of the Hearts and Souls of the Saints, duly conſidered, which are made up, as well of fleſh and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as of Spirit and Grace, the former having need of bridles for reſtraint, as well as the latter of ſpurs, for quickening; evident it is, that Arguments or Motives drawn from fear of puniſhment, are as neceſſary and proper for them in reſpect of the one, as incitements from love, in reſpect of the other. <hi>A whip for the Horſe,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) a bridle for the Aſs, and a rod for the Fools back</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 26. 3.</note>. The fleſh, even in the wiſeſt of men, is a <hi>Fool,</hi> and would be unruly without a rod ever and anon ſhaken over him. Nor ſhould God have made ſuch gracious, bountiful, and effectual proviſion for the Perſeverance of the Saints, as now he hath done, had he not engaged as well the paſſion of fear within them, as of love, to be their guardian and Keeper. It is true, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love casteth out Fear</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 18.</note>: but who amongſt the Saints themſelves can ſay, either that His Heart is clean, or His <hi>Love perfect? Perfect Love casteth out</hi> Fleſh, as well as <hi>Fear:</hi> yea, true <hi>Love,</hi> until fleſh be <hi>cast out,</hi> preſerveth <hi>Fear,</hi> for its aſſiſtant, and fellow-helper. The fleſh would ſoon make <hi>Love</hi> a Wanton, and intice her unto folly, did not <hi>Fear</hi> diſſolve the inchantment, and protect her chaſtity. But enough of this.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding if it be yet further demanded; But doth it not argue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> in men, to be drawn by the iron coard of the fear of Hell, to do what is their duty to do? Or doth any other ſervice, or obedience, become ſons and children, but onely that which is free, and proceedeth from Love? I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the great Law-giver, God, judged it not unworthy of Him, or His Wiſdom, to perſwade and preſs obedience to His Laws, and that as well upon true Beleevers, and ſuch who are His Children by Faith, as upon others (as we lately ſhewed from <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 4.) by Arguments drawn from fear of puniſhment, they have no reaſon to judg it unworthy of them, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be perſwaded and wrought upon accordingly. Nay (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse)
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:94900:176"/> if the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> commands, or requires of us, to <hi>feare him, who when he hath killed, is able to caſt both body and Soule into Hell,</hi> and that upon this very account (as we lately interpreted the place) we ſhall not be found obedient Children unto Him, unleſſe we doe <hi>feare</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a very different conſideration of the obedience of Children to their naturall Parents, and of the obedience of the Children of God unto their Heavenly Father. The obedience of the former, is taught by the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of nature, and is an act, not ſo much raiſed by deliberation, or flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the will by an interpoſure of the judgement and conſcience to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the election, as ariſing from an innate propenſion in Men, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the very conſtituting Principles of their nature or being: whereas the latter (the obedience of the Children of God) is taught by Precept, and the Principle of it (I meane that obedientiall frame of heart out of which they ſubject themſelves unto God) planted in the Souls of Men by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of Reaſon, Judgement, and Conſcience, to conſider thoſe Grounds, Arguments, and Motives, by which their Heavenly Father judgeth it meete to work and faſhion them unto ſuch a frame. So that though the obedience of naturall Children to their naturall Parents, be the more genuine and commendable, when it flowes freely from the pure inſtinct of nature, and is not drawn from them by feare of puniſhment; yet the obedience of the Children of God is then moſt genuine, commendable, and like unto it ſelf, when it is produced and raiſed in the Soule by a joynt influence, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, not of one, or of ſome, but of all thoſe Arguments, Reaſons, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Inducements, whatſoever, and how many ſoever, they be, by which their Heavenly Father deſires to plant and work it in them. For in this caſe, and in this onely, it hath moſt of God, of the Spirit of God, of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, of the goodneſſe of God in it: and upon this account i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> liklyeſt to be moſt free, uniforme, and permanent. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) that ſervice or obedience unto God, which is exhibited and performed unto him, either out of a deſire and hope of that <hi>great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward,</hi> Salvation, or out of a fear of ſuffering the vengeance of eternall fire, upon diſobedience, is not to be termed mercenary, or ſervile, meerly or ſimply becauſe ſuch an hope, or ſuch a feare, are intereſſed in the raiſing or procurement of it, unleſſe with all the exhibition and perform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nce of it, be burthenſome, grievous, and offenſive unto thoſe, who doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. For Men may act as willingly, as freely, as cheerfully, as conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, out of a Principle of Hope, yea and of feare it ſelf alſo, as from love it ſelf; yea and more willingly and freely, from the two former, then from the latter, unleſſe the Principle of love be advanced to a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Degree, Height, and Power in Men. There is no reaſon but to judge that <hi>Noah</hi> went about the making of his Ark, and continued in the work untill the finiſhing of it, with as much willingneſſe, cheerfulneſſe, and contentment of minde, as he performed any other Act of obedience unto God, at any time, notwithſtanding (as the <hi>Scripture</hi> informeth us) he was <hi>moved</hi> thereunto <hi>through feare</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 11 7.</note>. Nor is it credible but that <hi>Paul</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the work of mortification, <hi>keeping under his body, and bringing it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubjection,</hi> with all Willingneſſe, Freeneſſe, Cheerfulneſſe, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though he was ingaged and provoked hereunto by a <hi>feare, lest by any means, when he had Preached the Goſpell unto others, he Himſelf ſhould prove a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away</hi>

            <p>If that of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> be objected, <hi>feare hath torment</hi>

            <p>That <hi>feare,</hi> of which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh, and which he ſaith hath paine, or torment in it, is ſuch a feare, which hath little, or no hope, in conjunction with it. For ſuch a <hi>fear,</hi> which is accompanied with a certainty of Hope, that by the uſe of ſuch and ſuch meanes, which he is ſure he ſhall, or may, have, if he pleaſe, eſpecially the uſe of theſe means being otherwiſe honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and delightfull unto him, the evill feared ſhall be prevented; ſuch a feare (I ſay) as this, hath little, or no paine, or torment, in it at all. Now of this kinde is the <hi>fear,</hi> out of which the Children of God many times act, (as with Honour and Peace, they may) it is attended with a living hope, that by comporting or co-operating with the Grace of God, which they are aſſured they may, and ſhall have, for the asking, which co-operation is in it ſelf matter of honour and of delight unto them, they ſhall be delivered from the great evill <hi>feared,</hi> which is Hell, or the caſting out of the Preſence of God for ever. Though <hi>Noah</hi> was <hi>moved through feare</hi> (as we heard) to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Arke,</hi> for the ſafety of Himſelf, and his, yet he was as well moved hereunto through <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>Feare.

So that we may ſafely conclude that the threatnings of eternall death in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which are bent againſt the faces of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates and Backſliders, are a means graciouſly vouchſafed by God for the preſerving of His Saints from Apoſtaſie, and this by raiſing a feare of Hell within them, in caſe they ſhall neglect His Counſell for their Perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: and conſequently, that all ſuch threatnings are <hi>turned into ſtubble and rotten wood</hi> (in the Dialect of the Almighty, <hi>Job</hi> 41. 27.) I meane, are made powerleſſe and uſeleſſe, by the Principles of that Doctrine, which teacheth any abſoluteneſſe of Promiſe made unto the Saints for their finall Perſeverance.</p>
            <pb n="317" facs="tcp:94900:177"/>
            <p>Thirdly, (and laſtly) as this Doctrine evacuateth all the Exhortations,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> and Comminations, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> holdeth forth as means to preſerve the Saints in Faith and Holineſſe, unto the end, ſo doth it all the Promiſes alſo, which are here given in order to the procurement of the ſame end: the Vertue, Efficacy, and Power whereof are meerly nullified by ſuch a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as this, that Believers ſtand bound to believe an abſolute impoſſibility of their finall declining, or falling away to Perdition. For when Men are ſecured, and this by the infallible ſecurity of Faith, that the good things promiſed are already theirs, by the right and title of Faith, and that they ſhall certainely Perſevere in Faith unto the end, what need, or occaſion, is<note place="margin">See more of this Sect. 33. of this Chap.</note> there to perſwade or move theſe Men to doe that, which becomes them, in order to their Perſeverance, by any argument drawn from the Promiſe of ſuch things? A promiſe made to a Man of having, or keeping that, which is His own already, and which he certainely knowes, ſhall not, cannot be taken away from Him, can have no manner of influence upon Him by way of excitement, or inducement, to labour for the obtaining of it, or to doe the things, by which it is to be obtained. For as the Apoſtle reaſons in ſomewhat the like caſe; <hi>hope that is not ſeen, is not hope [i. e.</hi> that which ſometimes was the object of <hi>Hope,</hi> when it comes to be <hi>ſeen,</hi> or injoyed, <hi>is no</hi> longer the object of <hi>Hope] for what a Man ſeeth, why</hi> [or how] <hi>doth he yet hope for</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 8. 24.</note>? So may we argue in the caſe in hand: a Promiſe of what is already injoyed and poſſeſt, is no Promiſe: hath not the nature, property, or operation of a Promiſe in it, eſpecially not of a Promiſe ingaging unto action, in order to the obtaining of the good promiſed. A promiſe of this import, I meane, that is any wayes likely to ingage unto action, muſt be of ſome good thing ſo conditioned, in relation to Him, to whom the promiſe is made, that he hath no ground to expect the injoyment of it, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the performance of ſuch, or ſuch, an action, one, or more. For if ſuch actions and wayes, which are proper and requiſite for the obtaining of the good promiſed, be otherwiſe, and in themſelves deſirable, and would howſoever be choſen by him, to whom the promiſe is made, evident it is that the promiſe we ſpeak of, doth not in this caſe work at all upon Him, or raiſe ſuch an election in Him. Againe, if thoſe actions and wayes, which are proper and neceſſary for the obtaining of the good promiſed, be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unpleaſant and diſtaſtfull unto the Perſon we ſpeake of, to whom the Promiſe is ſuppoſed to be made, it is a clear caſe, that he will not lift up his Heart, or Hand unto them, but onely for the obtaining of ſuch a good and deſireable thing, which he hath reaſon to judge will never be obtained by Him, but only by the performance of ſuch things. For who will trouble Himſelf to run for that, which He knowes He may, and ſhall, obtaine by ſitting ſtill? Thus then it every way appeares, that the common Doctrine of abſolute and certaine Perſeverance, makes nothing but winde and vanity of all thoſe moſt ſerious and weighty Exhortations, Threatnings, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which concerne the Perſeverance of the Saints, and are directed by God unto them for this end and purpoſe, that by them they may be inabled, <hi>i. e.</hi> made willing, watchfull, and carefull to Perſevere: and conſequently the very face and ſpirit of the ſaid Doctrine, is directly ſet and bent againſt that high concernment of the Saints, I meane, their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance. For whatſoever nullifieth the means, is clearly deſtructive unto the end. And thus we have done with our ſecond Argument, for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that Doctrine, which teacheth a poſſibility of the Saints defection, and this unto Death.</p>
            <pb n="318" facs="tcp:94900:178"/>
            <p>A third Argument is this. That Doctrine which repreſenteth God, as<note place="margin">§. 18. <hi>Argum. 3.</hi>
               </note> weake, incongruous, and incoherent with Himſelf, in His applications unto Men, is not from God; and conſequently, that which contradicteth it, muſt needs be the Truth. But the Doctrine of Perſeverance oppoſed by us, putteth this great diſhonor upon God; repreſenteth Him weake, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Major Propoſition in this Argument is too great in evidence of Truth to be queſtioned. The Minor is made good by this conſideration; <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſaid Doctrine bringeth God upon the great Theater of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſpeaking thus, or to this effect, in the audience of Heaven and Earth, unto His Saints. <hi>You that truly believe in my Son Jeſus Chriſt, and have been once made partakers of my Holy Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are fully perſwaded and aſſured, according to my Will and Command given unto you in that behalfe, yea according to that enſealing of truth within you, which you have from me, that you cannot poſsibly, no not by all the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſins, and abominable practiſes, that you ſhall, or can, commit, fall away, either totally, or finally, from your Faith, that in the midſt of your fouleſt actions and courſes, there remaines a ſeed of Grace, or Faith, within you, which is ſufficient to make you true Believers, and to Preſerve you from falling away finally; that it is unpoſsible you ſhould die in your ſins; you that know, and are aſſured, that I will, by an irreſiſtible Hand, Worke Perſeverance in you, and conſequently, that you are out of all danger of condemnation, and that Heaven and Salvation belong unto you, and are as good as yours already, ſo that nothing but giving of thanks appertaines unto you, which alſo you know that I will, doe you what you will in the meane time, neceſsitate you unto; you (I ſay) that are fully and thoroughly perſwaded, and poſſeſt with the Truth of all theſe things, I earneſtly charge, admoniſh, exhort, and beſeech, that you take heede to your ſelves, that yee continue in the Faith, that there be not at any time an evill Heart of unbeliefe in you to depart from the Living God, that you fall not from your own ſtedfaſtneſſe. Yea, I declare and profeſſe unto you, that if you ſhall draw back, my Soule ſhall have no pleaſure in you, that if you ſhall deny Me, I will deny you; that if you be againe overcome of the luſts of the World, and be intangled herewith, that your latter end ſhall be worſe then your beginning: that if you ſhall turne away, all your former Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall not be remembred, but you ſhall die in your ſins, and ſuffer the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of eternall Fire. On the other hand, if you ſhall continue unto the end, my Promiſe is, that you ſhall be ſaved. Therefore ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate: quit your ſelves like Men: labour for the Meate that indureth unto everlaſting life; and be not ſloathfull, but followers of them, who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes.</hi> He that ſhall duly weigh and conſider, what a ſenceleſſe, and (indeed) ridiculous incongruity there is, between theſe Exhortations, Adjurations, Threatnings, and latter Promiſes, and thoſe Declarations, Applications, and former Promiſes, doubtleſſe will confeſſe, that either the one, or the other of them, are not from God, or according to the Minde of God. For how prepoſterous a thing is it, to threaten a Man with ſuffering the vengeance of Hell Fire, in caſe he ſhall not Perſevere, whom we have charged before confidently to believe that God will irreſiſtibly cauſe him to Perſevere, and eternally ſave him? But the Exhortations, Threatnings, and latter Promiſes, are expreſly from <hi>God,</hi> as our Adverſaries themſelves will not deny: therefore the former, Applications and Promiſes are the meere Notions and Conceits of Men, and have no Foundation in the Word of <hi>God:</hi> and conſequently the Doctrine
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:94900:178"/> of Abſolute Perſeverance is to be rejected, as a Doctrine rendering the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-wiſe God ſtrangely irrational, and inconſiſtent with Himſelf.<note place="margin">§. 19. <hi>Argum. 4.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If there be no poſſibility of the Saints falling away finally, then is their perſevering unto the end uncapable of reward from God. But their final Perſeverance is not uncapable of reward from God. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Minor Propoſition (I preſume) contains nothing, but what is the ſence of thoſe, who deny the Concluſion: or however, it contains nothing, but what is the expreſs ſence of the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> where He ſaith, <hi>But He that endureth to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 24. 13.</note>. Therefore we ſhall (I ſuppoſe) be excuſed from further proof of this, without any prejudice to the cauſe in hand. The conſequence in the Major Propoſition, ſtands firm upon this Foundation: No act of the Creature, whereunto it is neceſſitated, or which it cannot<note place="margin">See more of this Sect. 39 &amp; 40. of this Chapter.</note> poſſibly decline, or but do, is by any Law of God, or Rule of Juſtice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable. Therefore if the Saints be neceſſitated by God, to perſevere finally, ſo that He leaves unto them no poſſibility of declining finally, their final Perſeverance is not according to any Law of God, or man, nor indeed according to any Principle of ſound Reaſon, or Equity, capable of reward, no whit more, then actions meerly natural are. Nay, of the two, there ſeems to be more Reaſon, why acts meerly natural, as (for example) eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing, ſleeping, &amp;c. ſhould be rewarded, in as much as theſe flow, though in a way of neceſſity, yet from an inward Principle, and connatural to the Agent; then ſuch actions, whereunto the Agent is conſtrained, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated, or determined by a Principle of Power from without, and which is not intrinſecal to it. It is true, a Prince, or great man, may, if He pleaſe, beſtow gifts of what value He pleaſeth, upon thoſe, who live, breathe, eat, &amp;c. but He cannot be ſaid to reward them for living, breathing, eating, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Reward (in the proper ſignification of the word) imports a relation to ſuch actions, or ſervices, one, or more, which were in the Power of Him to have omitted, or refrained, who performed them. In like manner, God, if He judged it meet, may, or might, confer life and Salvation upon thoſe, who ſhall perſevere unto the end, though it ſhould be ſuppoſed that they were neceſsitated by Him thus to perſevere: but upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, as this, He could not be ſaid to <hi>reward</hi> them with Life or Salvation, for, or in reſpect of, ſuch their Perſeverance, for the Reaſon ſpecified. If we ſpeak of Rewards promiſed in order to the moving, or inclining, of the wills of men towards ſuch, or ſuch actions, or ways, (of which kinde alſo the Rewards mentioned in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as yet remaining to be conferred by God upon men, are,) the caſe is yet more clear, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are appropriate unto ſuch actions, and ways, unto the election and choyce whereof men are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitated, in one kinde, or other, eſpecially not by any phyſical, or forreign Power. For to what purpoſe ſhould a Reward be promiſed unto me, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade or make me willing to engage in ſuch, or ſuch a courſe, or to perform ſuch or ſuch a ſervice, in caſe I be neceſsitated unto the ſame engagement, or performance, other-ways? Or what place is there left for a Moral Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where a Phyſical Neceſsity hath done the execution? Or if the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inducement hath done the execution, and ſufficiently raiſed and engaged the Will to the action, with what congruity of Reaſon, yea or common ſence, can a Phyſical Neceſsity be ſuper-induced? Now that all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which God in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> promiſeth unto Perſeverance, or unto thoſe, who ſhall perſevere, are promiſed upon this account, <hi>viz.</hi> to work upon the wills of men, to make them willing and careful to perſevere, is a
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:94900:179"/> thing ſo <hi>rich</hi> in evidence, that it <hi>needs</hi> no proof. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith to the Church of <hi>Smyrna, Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 2. 10.</note>, can any man reaſonably imagine, but that the <hi>crown of life</hi> is promiſed by way of motive or encouragement, to make them <hi>faithful unto death?</hi> In like manner, when in His Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> He writeth thus; <hi>And He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to Him will I give power over the Nations</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 2. 26.</note>, doth He make this Promiſe (of <hi>giving power over Nations</hi>) with any other eye, or intent, then to raiſe hereby a ſpirit of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> valor and reſolution in them, not to give over fighting <hi>the good fight of Faith</hi> unto the end, which would be the victory or conqueſt here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended? Not to inſtance more particulars; when He ſpeaketh thus (to His Diſciples) <hi>but He that ſhall endure</hi> (meaning, in the loyalty of His affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto Him, and the Goſpel) <hi>unto the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 24. 13.</note>, doth he promiſe <hi>Salvation,</hi> to him that muſt, or ſhall be neceſsitated, will he, nill he, to <hi>endure unto the end?</hi> Or is there any more ſavor in the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> thus interpreted, then there would be in ſuch a Promiſe as this, <hi>But He that breatheth unto the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved?</hi> Therefore (queſtionleſs) our Saviours intent in promiſing <hi>Salvation,</hi> unto him that <hi>ſhould endure unto the end,</hi> was, by this Promiſe of ſo great a Reward, to provoke, animate, and encourage men to perſevere unto the end. Let all Expoſitors, both ancient, and modern, be conſulted upon the place. <hi>Although</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place) <hi>the love of many, being ſurcharged with the weight of iniquities, ſhall fail, yet Chriſt admoniſheth, that this obſtacle alſo</hi> [or impediment, in their way] <hi>muſt be overcome, lest thoſe that are faithful,</hi> and beleeve, <hi>being wearied</hi> [or, tired out] <hi>by evil examples, ſhould ſtart back</hi> [or recoyl from the Faith.] <hi>Therefore He repeats that ſaying, that none ſhall be ſaved, but He that ſhall ſtrive lawfully, ſo as to perſevere unto the end</hi>

The matter is ſo clear, that we ſhall need to produce no more witneſſes. So then, it being evident, that final Perſeverance in the Saints is truly and properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable by God, evident likewiſe it is, by the light of what hath been ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that it is not any thing phyſically neceſsitated upon them, or irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibly wrought in them, by God; but that it is ſuch a ſervice, or courſe of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto God, wherein they are voluntiers, and the performance whereof is as well in their power to decline, as to exhibit.</p>
            <p>A fifth Reaſon evincing the ſame Concluſion, is this. <hi>They who are</hi>

Therefore they are in a poſsibility alſo of periſhing; and ſo of falling away from the Grace and Favor of God, wherein at preſent they ſtand.</hi> The Major Propoſition in this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that they, who are in a poſſibility of perpetrating, or cuſtomary acting the works of the fleſh, are in a poſſibility of periſhing, &amp;c. is clearly proved from ſuch <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which exclude all workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fulfillers of the luſts of the fleſh, from the Kingdom of God: of which ſort there are many. <hi>Of the which</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the

So again: <hi>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, or unclean perſon, nor covetous man, who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God.

               <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 6 9, 10.</note>. From ſuch Paſſages as theſe, which are very frequent in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> it is as clear, as the light of the Sun at noon day, that they who may poſſibly commit ſuch ſins, as thoſe ſpecified, Adultery, Fornication, Idolatry, &amp;c. may as poſſibly periſh, and be for ever excluded the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</p>
            <p>Now that true Beleevers, are under a poſſibility of perpetrating and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch ſins as theſe (which was the effect and ſence of the Minor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) is altogether as evident, as the former, as both the <hi>Scriptures</hi> laſt cited (with their fellows) being in ſpecial manner directed unto true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, as alſo the ſad and frequent experience of ſuch Perſons as theſe, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into ſuch ſins, do abundantly manifeſt.

            <p>To pretend, that the Threatenings of <hi>non-inheriting the Kingdom of God,</hi> in<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> laſt quoted, are not bent againſt true Beleevers, or the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them intended upon them, though they ſhall commit the ſins ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but onely againſt Unbeleevers, is to ſet up Darkneſs againſt Light.

            <p n="1">1. The ſaid Paſſages are all directed to true and ſound Beleevers, yea to theſe onely; or at leaſt to thoſe, and onely thoſe, whom the Apoſtle judged to be ſuch.

            <p n="2">2.

Their unbelief alone is ſufficient matter of excluſion, againſt them.

Therefore certainly their ſence was, that true Believers, may ſin, above the rate of thoſe, who Sin out of infirmity, in as much as there is no Commandement of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that any Church of his ſhould eject ſuch perſons out of their externall Communion, who Sin out of infirmity onely. So that by the confeſſion of our Adverſaries themſelves, even true Believers may perpetrate ſuch Sins, which are of a deeper demerit, then to be numbred amongſt Sins of infirmity: yea ſuch Sins, for which the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> according to the Commandement of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſtands bound to judge them for ever excluded from the Kingdome of God, without Repentance. From whence it undeniably followes, that they may commit ſuch Sins, whereby their Faith in <hi>Christ</hi> will be <hi>totally</hi> wreck'd and loſt, becauſe <hi>there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> or excluſion from the Kingdome of <hi>God, unto thoſe that are</hi> [by Faith] <hi>in Christ Jeſus,</hi> whether they repent, or not. And therefore they that ſtand in need of Repentance to give them a right and title to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, are no <hi>Sons of God by Faith:</hi> for were they <hi>Sons,</hi> they would be <hi>heires</hi> alſo <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note>; and conſequently, have the cleareſt right and title to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, that is. So that to pretend, that however the Saints may fall into great and grievous Sins, yet they ſhall certainly be renewed againe by Repentance, before they die, though this be an Aſſertion without any bottome of Reaſon, or Truth, yet doth it no wayes oppoſe, but ſuppoſe rather, a Poſſibility of the totall defection of Faith in true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>Some, to maintaine this Poſition, that all the Sins of true Believers, are<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> Sins of infirmity, lay hold on this Shield. Such <hi>Men as theſe</hi> (they ſay) <hi>never Sin with their whole wills, or with full conſent.</hi> Therefore when they Sin, they never Sin but through infirmity. That they never Sin with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they conceive they prove ſufficiently, from that of the Apoſtle; <hi>For the good that I would, I doe not; but the evill, which I would not, that I doe. Now if I doe that I would not, it is no more I that doe it, but Sin that dwelleth in me</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 7. 19, 20.</note>. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Saints oft Sin with their whole wills, or full conſents, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably proved, by this conſideration; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe otherwiſe there ſhould
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:94900:181"/> be not only a plurality, or diverſity, but even a contrariety of wills in the ſame perſon, at one and the ſame inſtant of time, <hi>viz.</hi> when the ſuppoſed act of Sin is produced. Now it is an impoſſibility of the firſt evidence, that there ſhould be a plurality of acts, and theſe contrary the one unto the other, in one and the ſame ſubject, or agent, at one and the ſame inſtant of time. It is true, between the firſt moving of the fleſh in a Man towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of the Sin, and the compleating of this Sin by an actuall and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall patration of it, there may be ſucceſſively in him, not onely a plurality, but even a contrariety of volitions, or motions of the will, according to what the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpeaketh, concerning the <hi>fleſh luſting against the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh:</hi> but when the fleſh, having prevailed in the combate, bringeth forth her deſire into act, the ſpirit ceaſeth from his act of luſting: otherwiſe it will follow, that the fleſh is greater and ſtronger in her luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, then the Spirit of God in his, and that when the fleſh luſteth after the perpetration of ſuch, or ſuch a Sin, the ſpirit, as to the hindering of it, luſteth but in vaine: which is contrary to that of the Apoſtle <hi>John; greater is he that is in you</hi> (ſpeaking, as it is clear, of the Spirit of God, unto true Believers) <hi>then he that is in the World</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 4.</note>; meaning, Satan, and all his auxiliaries, Sin, Fleſh, Corruption, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded, but if the Spirit of God in true Believers, be <hi>greater</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 25.</note> and ſtronger in his luſtings, then the fleſh in his, how commeth it to paſſe, that in the ſpirituall duel, the fleſh ſo frequently prevaileth? I anſwer, the reaſon is, becauſe the ſpirit acts not, at leaſt to the juſt efficacy of his vigor and ſtrength, but onely when his preventing or firſt motions are entertained or ſeconded with a ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eable concurrence by the hearts and the wills of Men; through a deficiency or neglect whereof, he is ſaid to be <hi>grieved</hi> or <hi>quenched, i. e.</hi> to ceaſe from other actings, or movings, in Men. This truth is the ground of theſe, and ſuch like ſayings, in the writings of <hi>Paul: If ye through the ſpirit doe mortifie the deeds of the body, yee ſhall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 13, 14.</note>. Believers doe then <hi>mortifie the deeds of the Body, by the Spirit,</hi> when they joyne their wills unto his in his preventing motions of grace, and ſo draw, or obtaine, further ſtrength and aſſiſtance from him, in order to the great and difficult work of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. In reſpect of which concurrence alſo with the Spirit in his firſt and more gentle applications of himſelf unto them, they are ſaid to <hi>be led by the Spirit;</hi> as by their comportments with him in his higher and further applications, they become <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> according to that exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians: but be yee filled with the Spirit</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 5. 18.</note>; <hi>i. e.</hi> follow the Spirit cloſe in his preſent motions and ſuggeſtions within you, and you ſhall <hi>he filled with him, i. e.</hi> you ſhall find him moving and aſſiſting you upon all occaſions, at an higher, and more excellent and glorious rate. But this by the way. However, by that which hath been now ſaid, it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the reaſon why Believers, are ſo frequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> overcome by the luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the fleſh, notwithſtanding the contrary luſtings of the ſpirit within them before their foile, is not becauſe the fleſh hath more ſtrength to luſt, then the ſpirit, but becauſe they (the Men, Believers) have more will to hearken unto, and to goe along with the fleſh, in her luſtings, then with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in his; it being the Law, or Property of the Spirit, not to advance, or goe forward in his exertions of Himſelf, when he is deſerted and forſaken in his way, by the wills of Men. It is true, after ſuch deſertions of him in his motions, by the wills of Men, He doth not alwayes, wholly, and for ever,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:94900:182"/> deſert them; but moſt frequently returns againe in his motions and excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto them. Onely in His firſt applications unto Men, after He hath been ſo deſerted by them, as hath been ſaid, He doth not (I conceive) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, where He left, but where He began firſt of all; my meaning is, that He doth not move, or act in them at any ſuch high, or filling rate, as at which He wrought, or was ready to worke, when He was forſaken; but according to the line, or proportion, of His preventing motions, which generally are of a cooler and ſofter inſpiration, then His ſubſequent. But thus we ſee it an apparant error, to ſay, that true Believers never ſin with their whole wills, or fulneſſe of conſent: which yet might be made more apparant, by the conſideration of <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, in, and upon, His committing of thoſe two great Sins, Homicide, and Adultery. For doubtleſſe had there been any reluctancy of will, or renitency of Conſcience, or of the ſpirit within Him, when He committed the former of the two, Adultery, He would not have added the ſecond, Murther, ſo ſoon after, to it. Again, had there been any ſuch Reluctancy or Renitency in Him, as we ſpeak of, when He perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, either the one abomination, or the other, doubtleſſe He could not have digeſted both the one and the other without any remorſe, or ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, for ſo long a time together, as paſſed between the acting of His ſaid ſins, and the time, when the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> was ſent from God unto Him to awaken Him unto Repentance.

Or if we ſhall affirme, that the contrary bent, or motions, of His will at other times, is a ſufficient proof, that when he did it [the <hi>evill</hi> we ſpeake of] he did it not with his whole will, or fulneſſe of conſent, and ſo make this <hi>doing of evill,</hi> or committing of Sin, without fulneſſe of conſent (in ſuch a ſence) a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character between Men regenerate, and unregenerate, we ſhall bring <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> yea and probably <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf, into the Liſt or Roll of Men Regenerate, with a thouſand more, whom the <hi>Scriptures</hi> know not under any ſuch Name, or relation; as <hi>viz.</hi> all thoſe, whoſe Judgements and

Concerning <hi>Herod,</hi> it is evident, that He did not give Commiſſion for the beheading of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, with fulneſs of conſent, in the ſence mentioned: for when <hi>Herodias,</hi> to whom He had <hi>promiſed with an Oath to give, whatſoever ſhe would ask,</hi> had demanded <hi>John Baptiſts Head in a Charger,</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>the King was ſorry: nevertheleſs for the Oaths ſake, and them that ſate with Him at meat, He commanded it to be given Her</hi>

Which plainly ſheweth, that He had a renitency of will againſt the <hi>evil</hi> which He did, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the doing of it: yea, and that He would not have done it, had not the temptations mentioned overcome that inclination. The caſe is every whit as clear in <hi>Pilate; viz.</hi> that He gave the ſentence of Death againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with great relunctancy of minde and will preceding, and ſo not with fulneſs of conſent (in the ſence declared.)

I anſwer further, that when He ſaith, <hi>the evil which I would not, that I do,</hi> He doth not ſpeak of what He always, and in all caſes, did, much leſs of what was poſsible for him to do; but of what He did ordinarily, or frequently; or of what was very incident unto him through the infirmity of the fleſh; <hi>viz.</hi> through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs, and anticipation by temptations, to do ſuch things, which, whileſt He was in a watchful and conſidering Poſture, and from under the malign influence of a tentation, He was altogether averſe unto. Now what a man doth ordinarily, is one thing, and what He doth ſometimes, and in ſome particular caſe, eſpecially, what it is poſsible for Him to do, is another. That true Beleevers, whileſt ſuch, ordinarily ſin not upon worſe terms, then thoſe mentioned by the Apoſtle concerning His ſinning, I eaſily grant: but it no ways followeth from hence, that therefore they never ſin upon other terms, much leſs, that it is unpoſsible that they ſhould ſin upon other. And thus we ſee, all things throughly and unpartially argued and debated, to and fro, that even true Beleevers themſelves, as well as others, may do thoſe <hi>works of the Fleſh,</hi> which exclude from the Kingdom of God; and that in reſpect hereof they are ſubject to this excluſion, as well as other men.</p>
            <p>Whereas ſome object againſt this Argument and Doctrine, that it maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> or diſmembereth the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and brings in an uncouth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly interchange and rechange of members between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Devil, that it maketh Regeneration iterable, &amp;c. I anſwer; that all theſe, with the like, are but pretended inconveniences, and ſuch onely to appearance; the <hi>Scripture</hi> juſtifieth them, and judgeth them no inconveniences at all: yea, it holdeth them forth as things neceſſary and comely in the inſtitutions and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God.</p>

For as in a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique or Civil Corporation, it is better that the Governors ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Members reſpectively to go, or be, at liberty, that ſo they may follow their buſineſs and occaſions in the world upon the better terms, though by occaſion of this liberty, they may be have themſelves in ſundry kindes very unworthily, then it would be to keep them cloſe Priſoners, though hereby the ſaid inconveniences might certainly bee prevented: in like manner, it is much better for the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and for the reſpective Members of it, that He ſhould leave them at liberty (eſpecially upon ſuch terms as He doth, and which have formerly been declared) to obey and ſerve God, and follow the important affairs of their Souls, freely, and without any Phyſicall Neceſsitation, though ſome do turne this liberty into wantonneſs, and ſo, into deſtruction, then it would be, to deprive them of this liberty, and to cauſe and conſtraine them to any courſe whatſoever out of neceſsity, though (it is true) the committing of much ſin and iniquity would be prevented hereby in many. The Reaſon of the compariſon betweene the one courſe, and the other, as now it hath beene ſtated and aſſerted, hath beene already layd downe, and argued, in this Chapter <note n="a" place="margin">Sect. 19.</note>.

            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, for the frequent repetition of Regeneration, it is of the ſame<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> conſideration with the two former Particulars: there is no inconvenience, nothing unworthy God, or of Chriſt, in it: and for men, it is of a moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and bleſſed accommodation unto them. When the Scripture ſpeaks of an <hi>impoſsibility</hi> of <hi>renewing</hi> ſome <hi>by Repentance,</hi> in caſe they <hi>fall away</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.</note>, it plainly ſuppoſeth that there is ſuch a thing incident unto men, or whereof ſome men are capable, as <hi>renewing again by Repentance.</hi> And what is Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, being interpreted, but a <hi>renewing again by Repentance?</hi> And if men may dye twice, ſpiritually, (as <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaketh of ſome that were <hi>twice dead,</hi> Verſ. 12.) why may they not live twice, or twice receive the life of grace oppoſite hereunto? As it is agreeable to the Righteouſneſs and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, to denounce the ſentence of excluſion from his Kingdom againſt men, whoever they be, or have been, when they turn Adulterers, Fornicators, Idolaters, &amp;c. yea and to execute this ſentence accordingly, in caſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn not from theſe ſins by Repentance, before they dye; and ſo to leave them no footing, or foundation for their Faith, I mean, to beleeve, or to expect Salvation by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but onely upon their Repentance; ſo is it no leſs agreeable to the Mercy, Patience, and goodneſs of God, to promiſe unto back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding ſinners, a re-injoyment of his Favor, and Love, which is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> upon condition of their <hi>renewing again by Repentance,</hi> and to exhibit unto them accordingly the full fruits thereof in the Salvation of their Souls, if they perſevere in a courſe of Repentance unto the end. And how ſad and deplorable above meaſure would the condition of many thouſands of Saints be, in caſe there were no reiteration of Regeneration; I mean, of all ſuch, who at any time fall into ſuch ways and practiſes of ſin, which (according to what we have lately heard from the <hi>Scriptures) exclude from the Kingdom of God!</hi> Doubtleſs there is no more inconvenience for the ſame perſon to be twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, then it was, or would have been, under the Law, for the ſame man to have taken Sanctuary the ſecond time, in caſe He had the ſecond time miſcarried in ſlaying a man at unawares. And for Regeneration it ſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Grammatical and proper ſignification of the word, it imports a reiteration, or repetition, of ſome generation, or other. It cannot import a repetition of the natural generation of men: the ſence of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in<note place="margin">John 3. 4.</note> this point, was orthodox, who judged ſuch a thing impoſſible: therefore it muſt import a repetition of a ſpiritual generation; unleſs we ſhall ſay (which I know is the road Opinion) that it ſignifies onely the ſpiritual generation, with a kinde of reference unto, or reflexion upon, the birth natural. But it is the common ſence of Divines, that the two generations mentioned, the natural, and ſpiritual, are <hi>membra dividentia,</hi> and contradiſtinguiſhed the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:94900:184"/> one unto the other: and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to ſtate &amp; repreſent them <note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 23.</note>; as alſo our Saviour Himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 6. Now I ſuppoſe there can hardly any inſtance be given, where the introducing of one contrary form, or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, into the ſubject, is termed a reiteration, or repetition of the other. Calefaction (for example) is never termed a repetition of frigefaction: nor is albi-faction called a reiteration of nigri-faction: nor when a regenerate or mortified man dyeth His natural death, is He ſaid to reiterate, or repeat His ſpiritual death. Therefore I rather conceive that Regeneration, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> makes appropriable onely unto perſons living to years of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who generally in the days of their youth degenerate from the innocency of their childhood and younger years, and corrupt themſelves with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and ways of the world, relates, not unto the natural generation, as ſuch, (I mean, as natural,) but unto the ſpiritual eſtate and condition of men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Natural generation and birth; in, and upon, which, they are, if not ſimply and abſolutely, yet comparatively, innocent, harmleſs, free from pride, malice, &amp;c. and in reſpect of theſe qualifications, in grace and favor with God, upon the account of the death and ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for them; (as we ſhall, God willing, prove more at large in the ſecond part of this Diſcourſe.) In the mean time, what we now offer as moſt probable, touching the Reaſon of the name, and relation, of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> I conceive our Saviour Himſelf implieth in that Paſſage of His with His Diſciples. <hi>At the ſame time came the Diſciples unto Jeſus, ſaying, who is the greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven? And Jeſus called a little childe unto Him, and ſet Him in the midst of them, and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, except ye be</hi> CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERTED, AND BECOME AS LITTLE CHILDREN, <hi>ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>

Calvins</hi> words (in Engliſh) are theſe: <hi>And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion whereof He ſpeaks, imports, that His Diſciples had at this time too much accuſtomed themſelves to the common courſe and manners of men</hi> [in the world] <hi>and therefore, that they might aſpire to the mark</hi> [at which they aimed: I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe He meaneth, greatneſs in the Kingdom of Heaven,] they <hi>muſt turn back in their courſe</hi>

            <p>Nor is that, which I have ſometimes heard alledged in oppoſition to the<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> Doctrine maintained in the Digreſſion yet in hand, any whit more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; as <hi>viz.</hi> that it teacheth, or ſuppoſeth, a blotting, and a blurring, a putting in, and a putting out, of Names, in Gods Book of Life; which ſome (it ſeems) conceive to be unſeemly, and ſome wayes diſparaging the ſaid Book. But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf frequently ſpeakes of that, which the Objectors call a <hi>blotting</hi> in the ſaid Book of God, and that without the leaſt intimation of any diſparagement hereby unto it.

So when God returned this anſwer to that His demand: <hi>Whoſoever hath ſinned againſt me, him will I blot out of my Booke,</hi> He did not intend any blemiſh to His Book. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> from Heaven ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth Himſelf thus to the Church of <hi>Sardis; He that overcommeth, the ſame ſhall be clothed in white rayment, and I will not blot out His Name out of the Booke of Life</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Revel. 3. 5.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He clearly ſuppoſeth, that there were, or at leaſt, might be, ſome, whoſe Names he would <hi>blot out of this Book:</hi> otherwiſe it would be no matter of honor, or ſpecialty of priviledge, which He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth herein. As in caſe all Men were to be <hi>cloathed in white,</hi> and no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of any Mans falling ſhort of this honour, it had been very impertinent and unproper for our Saviour to promiſe with ſo much ſolemnity, as the words import, a <hi>Cloathing in white,</hi> by way of reward, <hi>unto him that overcommeth.</hi> See alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To conceive, that what the <hi>Scripture</hi> meaneth by <hi>blotting out of the Book of Life,</hi> ſhould be any matter of defacement to this Book, or any thing unſeemly for God otherwiſe, ſavours of Carnality of Notion about this Book: and of a miſ-apprehenſion of what is ſeemly, and unſeemly, for God to doe. For Gods <hi>Book of Life,</hi> is nothing elſe, but His generall purpoſe or decree concerning perſons to be ſaved, not by their Names, but their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities or qualifications. So that when He is ſaid to <hi>blot out</hi> any Mans <hi>Name out of this Book,</hi> (which He never doth, or is ſaid to doe, but upon their deveſting themſelves of that capacity, in reſpect whereof they are ſaid to have been written in this Book, according to what we lately heard from himſelf, <hi>whoſoever hath ſinned againſt me, Him will I blot out of My Book</hi>) it importeth onely this, that whereas before, whileſt he remained faithfull, and upright with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God, according to his Purpoſe, and Promiſe made to ſuch Men, intended Life and Salvation unto him, now, by reaſon of his back-ſliding unto Sin and Wickedneſſe, he purpoſeth to deſtroy him, and that according to his generall and unpartiall decree of deſtroying ſinners and wicked Men, if they repent not. So that if it be not unſeemly for God to deſtroy backſliding ſinners, who remaine hardened and impenitent to the

               </note> 
               <hi>That Doctrins which is according unto godlineſſe,</hi> i. e. <hi>whoſe naturall and proper tendency is to promote godlineſſe in the hearts, and lives of Men, is Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and of unqueſtionable comportance with the Truth. Such is the Doctrine, which teacheth a Poſsibility of the Saints declining, both totally, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of the Major Propoſition (though the truth of it needs no light, but its own, to be ſeen by) is, becauſe the Goſpell it ſelf is a <hi>Doctrine, which is according unto godlineſſe</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 3.</note>, <hi>a Truth according unto godlineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> i. e. a <hi>Doctrine, Truth, and Myſtery</hi> calculated, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd, and fram'd by God with a ſingular aptneſſe, and choyceneſſe of ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, for the advancement of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in the World. Therefore what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Doctrine ſoever is of the ſame ſpirit, tendency and import, muſt needs be a naturall branch thereof, and of perfect accord with it. This propoſition then is unqueſtionable.</p>
            <p>Nor can the Minor lightly be leſſe unqueſtionable to him, that ſhall duly and unpartially examine and weigh the frame, and import of it. For what Doctrine can be more proper, or powerfull, to promote godlineſſe in the hearts and lives of Men, then that, which on the one hand promiſeth a Crown of bleſſedneſſe, and eternall glory, to thoſe that live godlily without declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and on the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hand threateneth the vengeance of eternall Fire againſt thoſe, that ſhall turne aſide unto prophainneſſe, and not ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rne by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Whereas that Doctrine, which promiſeth, and that with all poſſible certainty and aſſureance, all fulneſſe of bleſſedneſſe and glory, to thoſe that ſhall at any time, be godly, though they ſhall the very next day, or houre, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and turne looſe and prophane, and continue never ſo long in ſuch a courſe, is moſt manifeſtly deſtructive unto godlineſſe, and incouraging above meaſure to prophainneſſe.</p>
            <p>If it be objected and ſaid; yea but the aſſureance of the unchangeableneſſe<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> of Gods Love towards him that is godly, is both a more effectuall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading motive <hi>unto</hi> godlineſſe, and more incouraging unto a perſevering <hi>in</hi> godlineſſe, then a doubtfulneſſe or uncertainty, whether God will be conſtant in His affection to ſuch a Man, or no. Certainty of reward is more incouraging unto action, then uncertainty. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Doctrine which teacheth a poſſibility of the <hi>Saints</hi> finall defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, teacheth an aſſurance of the unchangeableneſſe of Gods Love, towards him that is godly, as well as the Doctrine contrary to it; onely with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:94900:186"/> this latter Doctrine teacheth the ſaid unchangeableneſſe, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and againſt all poſſible change by ſin and wickedneſſe, in the perſon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed (at preſent) to be godly; whereas the former teacheth and aſſerteth the ſame unchangeableneſſe, but conditionally, and upon the Perſeverance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him that is godly, in his courſe. So that this Doctrine teacheth as much c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ainty of the love of God towards him that is godly, as ſuch, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſuch, as the other doth. And the truth is, that the other Doctrine, rightly interpreted, doth not ſo much promiſe abſolutely the certainty of Gods love, to him that is godly, as it promiſeth conditionally the certainty of this love, to him that is prophane, <hi>viz.</hi> in caſe, and upon condition that he hath been once <hi>godly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither is certainty of reward, in every ſence, or kinde, more encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging unto action, then uncertainty, in ſome kinde. To promiſe withall poſſible aſſureance, the ſame reward, or prize, to him that ſhall not run in the race, which is promiſed upon theſe terms to him that ſhall run, is not more incouraging unto Men thus to run, then to promiſe it conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> upon their running: which is a promiſing of it with uncertainty, in this reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it is uncertaine whether Men will run in the ſaid race, or no; and conſequently whether they ſhall receive the ſaid prize, or no, upon ſuch a promiſe.

               </gap>ctuall or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing upon Men that are godly, to perſevere in godlineſs, as ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, which hath been aſſerted. Nay, the truth is, that ſuch an aſſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance effectually given to him that is godly, without any condition of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining godly, is no incouragement at all unto him to perſevere in godlineſſe, but rather to turne aſide unto prophainneſs. The reaſon is plaine: No re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which is promiſed unto Men ſimply and abſolutely, is incouraging to any action, or ingagement whatſoever. It is true, a ſimple and abſolute promiſe of a reward may be, and commonly is oblieging unto action by way of duty or thankfulneſs unto him, who maketh the promiſe: but is never ſo oblieging unto action ſimply, as ſuch a promiſe, which aſſureth the reward onely upon the performance of the action. Hence it is that the Apoſtle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging and perſwading Men unto holineſs, holds forth, not abſolute, but conditionall promiſes unto them, in order hereunto. The tenor of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes we meane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is this: <hi>wherefore come out from among them, and be yee ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, And will be a Father unto you, and yee ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty</hi>

Upon the account of theſe promiſes, he immediately ſubjoyns: <hi>Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> THESE <hi>promiſes (dearly beloved) let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe in the feare of God</hi>

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:94900:186"/> Such Promiſes at <hi>theſe, viz.</hi> which hold forth ſuch great and bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and withall, require and injoyn Holineſs, by way of condition, for the receiving and enjoyment of them, are of the moſt ſoveraign efficacy and import, that can be imagined, to perſwade you unto Holineſs. Nor can any inſtance (I beleeve) be given from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> where the Holy Ghoſt preſſeth, or perſwadeth unto action, or ways of Righteouſneſs, by any other kinde of Promiſe, then that, which is, either in form, or in matter, [<hi>i. e.</hi> in ſence and meaning] conditional.</p>
            <p>Beſides, whether any ſuch aſſureance of the unchangeableneſs of the Love of God towards Him that is godly, as the Objection ſpeaks of, can be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, and upon ſufficient grounds, given unto men, is very queſtionable; yea, I conceive there is more Reaſon to judg otherwiſe, then ſo. Yea, (that which is yet more) I verily beleeve, that in caſe any ſuch aſſureance of the unchangeableneſs of Gods Love, were to be found in, or could regularly be deduced from, the Scriptures, it were a juſt ground to any intelligent and conſidering man to queſtion their Authority, and whether they were from God, or no. For that a God, infinitely righteous and holy, ſhould irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly aſſure the immortal and undefiled inheritance of His Grace and Favor, unto any Creature whatſoever, ſo that though this Creature ſhould prove never ſo abominable in His ſight, never ſo outragiouſly and deſperately wicked and profane, He ſhould not be at liberty to withhold this inheritance from Him, is a ſaying (doubtleſs) too hard for any man, who rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands and conſiders the Nature of God, to hear. For what can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he ſhould promiſe more to ſuch a Perſon, who ſhould remain loyal in his affections, and conſtant in his obedience unto him, without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide either to the right hand, or to the left, all his days? And <hi>where</hi> now would be <hi>the God of Judgment? Ye have wearied the Lord with your words</hi> (ſaith <hi>Malachi</hi> in Gods Name unto the People;) <hi>Yet ye ſay, wherein have we wearied Him? When ye ſay, every one that doth evil, is good in the ſight of the Lord, and He delighteth in them: and where is the God of Judgment</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mal. 2. 17.</note>? Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implying, 1. That to ſay, that <hi>God delighteth in them that do evil,</hi> is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſing and diſhonorable to him, amounting to no leſs, being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, then a denyal of his being a <hi>God of Judgment, i. e.</hi> of his Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, or that he puts any difference in his affections, between the beſt and worſt of men. 2. That, notwithſtanding the great offenſiveneſs unto God of ſuch a ſaying, yet they that utter it, are backward to conſider any ſuch unworthineſs in it.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible that yet ſome will further object (againſt the Argument in<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> hand) unleſs the Saints be aſſured of the Perpetuity of their ſtanding in the Grace and Favor of God, they muſt needs be under fears of falling away, and ſo of periſhing: and fear (we know) is of a diſcouraging and enfeebling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, an enemy unto ſuch actions, which men of confidence and courage, are apt and ready to undertake. I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the ſtrength of this Objection hath been already troden down, and that more then once. See Sect. 15. &amp; 16. of this Chapter: and more upon the ſame account, Cap. 9. I here add,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Saints, notwithſtanding the poſſibility of their final falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, have, or may have, ſuch an aſſureance of the Perpetuity of their ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Grace and Favor of God, which may exclude all fear, at leaſt, that is of a diſcouraging, or enfeebling nature. The Apoſtle (as we have formerly ſhewed <note n="b" place="margin">Sect. 16. of this Chapt.</note>) lived at a very excellent rate both of courage and confidence,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:94900:187"/> notwithſtanding he knew that it was poſſible for him to become a <hi>Reprobate.</hi> The aſſureance he had, that upon a diligent uſe of thoſe meanes, which he knew aſſuredly God would vouchſafe unto him, he ſhould prevent his being a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> was a golden foundation unto him of that confidence and courage, wherein he equaliz'd the holy Angels themſelves. Suppoſe a Man hath a deepe well, or pit of water, in his Yeard or grounds neere adjoyning to his Houſe, he is no more afraid of being drowned either in the one, or in the other, then he that lives, a thouſand miles diſtance from them. The reaſon is, becauſe he knowes he need not be in any danger of ſuch a miſcarriage, by them, unleſſe he pleaſe. The evill, which a Man knows he may prevent, if he will, and that which ſimply is not, or, not poſſible to be, is of the ſame conſideration to a ſober and intelligent Man; eſpecially if he knows that he may prevent it, if he will, without any dammage, or inconvenience to him. And for courage and confidence, the truth is, that there is no place for them, but under a poſſibility at leaſt, of danger, and miſcarrying by an enemie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) an aſſureance of a perpetuall injoyment of, or abiding in, the love and favour of God, otherwiſe then upon condition of love and loyalty in the Creature towards him, is neither honorable for God to make, or grant, nor meet for a Creature to expect, or deſire. Who can judge it much ſhort of blaſphemy to put ſuch a ſaying as this into the mouth of the moſt holy God, unto any of his Creatures: though thou addeſt drunkenneſſe to thirſt, and polluteſt thy ſelf with all the abominations of wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men, though thou committeſt Whoredome, Adultery, Inceſt, Murther. Theft, though thou hateſt to be reformed, and caſteſt all my Commandements behinde thy back, &amp;c. yet ſhalt thou be precious in mine Eyes, and mine Heart ſhall be towards thee in the greateſt love, and deereſt affection for ever: and thou ſhalt inherit my everlaſting Kingdome, thy deſperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions againſt me notwithſtanding. I know my oppoſers are not wont to deliver themſelves, or expreſſe their Doctrine, in ſuch terms as theſe, nor will they (haply) well beare ſuch a Repreſentation of it, as this: but I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to their Conſciences, and to the unpartiall Reaſons of all unprejudiced Men, whether their Doctrine of Perſeverance, doth not, without any wreſting, ſtrayning, or perverting in the leaſt, directly lead to ſuch an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid thought, or conceit of God, as that preſented in the ſaid ſaying. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine I am, that the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> Himſelf, reſolves his abiding in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love, into his keeping of His Commandements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and informes His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples withall, that he loves them upon the ſame termes. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you: continue yee in my love.

               <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 15. 9, 10.</note>. By the way, had there been an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voideable neceſſity lying upon the Diſciples to <hi>continue in Christs love,</hi> there had been no neceſſity of his exhortation unto them, in order thereunto. Who perſwades a Man to doe that, which is not in his power to neglect, or not to doe? In like manner, had there been a like unavoydeable neceſſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Diſciples, <hi>to keep Chriſts Commandements,</hi> doubtleſſe he would not have preſcribed it unto them in the nature of a conditionall means, for their <hi>abiding in his love.</hi> No Man in his right mind makes conditions of things, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are unavoydable, or which cannot but be performed by them, of whom they are required.</p>
            <p>To pretend, that the weakneſſe of the fleſh, even in the beſt of the Saints<note place="margin">§. 35.</note>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:94900:187"/> conſidered, and their aptneſſe to goe aſtray, they muſt needs lie under many troubleſome and tormenting feares of periſhing, unleſſe they have ſome promiſe or aſſureance from God to ſupport them, that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any declinings or goings aſtray incident unto them, yet they ſhall not loſe his favour, or periſh; is to pretend nothing, but what hath been throughly anſwered already, eſpecially in the ninth Chapter.

            <p n="1">1. That the weakneſſe of the fleſh, or the aptneſſe of miſcarrying through this, is no reaſonable ground of fear unto any true Believer, of his periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; conſidering, that no Man loſeth, or forfeiteth the Grace and Favour of God, through Sins of <hi>weakneſs</hi> or infirmity.

            <p n="2">2. If the Saints be willing to ſtrengthen the <hi>Spirit</hi> in them, and make him <hi>willing,</hi> proportionably to the means vouchſafed unto them by God for ſuch a purpoſe, this will fully balance the weakneſſe of the fleſh, and prevent the miſcarriage and breakings out hereof. <hi>This I ſay then</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>walk in the Spirit, and yee ſhall not fulfill the luſt of the fleſh.</hi> And againe: <hi>If yee be led by the Spirit, yee are not under the Law</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 5. 16. 18</note>; and conſequently, are in no danger of loſing the favour of God, or of periſhing for ſuch ſins, which, under the conduct of the ſpirit, you are ſubject unto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly,) There is no ſuch aptneſſe or proneneſſe unto ſin (Sins I meane of a diſ-inheriting import) in Saints, or true Believers, as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but on the contrary, a ſtrong propenſion or inclination unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, reigneth in them. We heard formerly from the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin: for his ſeed remaineth in him: and he</hi> CANNOT <hi>ſin, becauſe he is born of God</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 John 3. 9</note>. Which paſſage of <hi>Scripture</hi> the Reader may finde unfolded at large, Cap. 10. Sect. 25, 26, 27, &amp;c. The ſame Apoſtle, to the ſame purpoſe, had ſaid a little before: <hi>He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin, is of the Devill:</hi> and conſequently, no <hi>Saint,</hi> or true Believer. And againe (a little after) he ſaith: <hi>In this the Children of God are manifeſt, and the Children of the Devill: whoſoever doth not righteouſneſſe, is not of God,</hi> &amp;c. Afterwards, thus: <hi>For this is the love of God, that we keep His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: and His Commandments [i. e.</hi> the keeping of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments] <hi>is not grievous</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 John 5. 3.</note>; <hi>viz.</hi> to him that loveth God, <hi>i. e.</hi> to a <hi>Saint,</hi> or true Believer: It followeth: <hi>For whoſoever is borne of God, overcommeth the World: and this is the victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith. Who is he that overcometh the World, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God?</hi> From theſe paſſages (with many others of like import, which might have been added from the ſame Apoſtle) it is fully evident, that there is a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſtrong, triumphing propenſion in all true Believers, to walk holily, and to live righteouſly: ſo that to refraine ſinning (ſinning I meane, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, cuſtomarily, and againſt conſcience, which kinde of Sin onely is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive from the love, and Kingdome of God) is no ſuch great maſtery, no ſuch matter of difficulty, unto ſuch Men: and that when they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and fall into ſuch Sins, it is through a meere voluntary neglect of ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Grace of God that is in them, and of maintaining that holy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple we ſpeak of in ſtrength and vigour, by ſuch means, as God moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and indulgently vouchſafeth unto them in abundance, for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And thus we ſee, all things unpartially weighed and debated to and fro, that the Doctrine, which ſuppoſeth a poſſibility of the <hi>Saints</hi> finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:94900:188"/> is the Doctrine which is <hi>according to godlineſſe,</hi> and the corrivall of it, an enemy thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Doctrine, whoſe genuine and proper tendency is to advance the peace and</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 36. <hi>Argum. 7.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>joy of the Saints in believing, is of a naturall ſympathy with the Goſpell, and upon this account, a truth. Such is the Doctrine, which informeth the Saints of a poſsibility of their totall and finall falling away. Ergo.</hi> Our adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the cauſe depending, will not (I preſume) regret the granting of the former propoſition; the truth of it being a truth ſo neere at hand. The Minor hath received confirmation in abundance, from what was argued and evinced in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapter: where we demonſtratively proved, that the Doctrine we now aſſert, is of the moſt healthfull, and ſound conſtitution to make a Nurſe for the peace and joy, and comforts of the <hi>Saints:</hi> whereas that which is oppoſite to it, is but of a melancholique and ſad complexion, in compariſon. The ground we built our Demonſtration upon, was this: That Doctrine which is of the moſt incouraging, quickning, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning import to the Spirit and Grace of God in Men, on the one hand, and moſt crucifying and deſtructive to the fleſh on the other hand, muſt needs be a Doctrine of the beſt and choyceſt accommodation for the Peace and Comfort of Believers. The reaſon hereof, is, becauſe the Peace, Joy, and Comfort of Believers, doe, if not wholly, yet in a very great meaſure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the <hi>fruits of the Spirit,</hi> and the teſtimony of their Conſciences concerning their loyalty and faithfulneſſe unto God, in doing His will, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His Commandments, refraining <hi>all falſe wayes</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh) abſtaining from the works of the fleſh, &amp;c. As on the contrary, that Roote of bitterneſſe in the <hi>Saints,</hi> from which feares and doubtings, perplexities, agonies, and conſternations of ſoule ſpring, is the fleſh, when, for want of a ſharpe bridle ſtill kept in the jawes or lips of it, it breaks out, becomes unruly, and magnifies it ſelf againſt God, and His Lawes. Theſe things we proſecuted more at large in the fore named Chapter: where likewiſe we proved, above all reaſonable contradiction, that the ſence of thoſe, who aſſert a poſſibility of the <hi>Saints drawing back</hi> even to perdition, is a Doctrine of a very rich ſympathy with the Spirit, or regenerate part in Men, of an excellent and high animation unto it, and on the contrary, a Doctrine mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inſpired againſt the fleſh, with all the luſts and wayes hereof. Here alſo we gave an anſwer in full unto thoſe, who are wont to object and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the beſt and holieſt perſons more generally cleave in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Doctrine of abſolute Perſeverance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as on the other hand, that perſons more carnally and looſely diſpoſed, more generally take up that, which is contrary unto it. So that we ſhall not need to add in this place any thing further to give weight, or ſtrength, to the Argument in hand, unleſſe it be to certifie the Reader, that ſince the publiſhing and clearing the Doctrine now aſſerted, ſome very godly and ſeriouſly Religious perſons, have with their whole Hearts bleſſed God for it. We proceede to another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Doctrine which evacuates, and turns into weakneſſe and folly all that</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 37. <hi>Argum. 8.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>gracious counſell of the Holy Ghost, which conſiſts, partly in that diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which he gives unto the Saints from place to place, concerning the hoſtile, cruell and bloody minde and intentions of Satan againſt them, partly in detecting, and making knowne all his ſubtil ſtratagems, his Plots, Methods, and dangerous machinations againſt them, partly alſo in furniſhing them with ſpirituall weapons of all ſorts, whereby they may be able to grapple with him notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:94900:188"/> and gloriouſly to triumph over him; partly againe in thoſe frequent Admonitions, Exhortations, Incouragements to quit themſelves like Men in reſiſting him, and making good their ground againſt him, which are found in the Scriptures; and laſtly, in profeſsing his feare leſt Satan ſhould circumvent and deceive them; that Doctrine</hi> (I ſay) <hi>which reflects diſparagement and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon all theſe most ſerious and gracious applications of the Holy Ghoſt unto the Saints, must needs be a Doctrine of vanity and error: and conſequently, that which oppoſeth it, by like neceſsity, a truth. But ſuch is the common Doctrine of abſolute and infallible Perſeverance.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> in this Argument is greater then exception. For doubtleſſe no Doctrine, which is of an undervaluing import, either to the Grace, or Wiſdome, of the Holy Ghoſt in any <hi>Scripture</hi> tranſaction, can be Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, or conſiſtent with truth. The <hi>Minor</hi> likewiſe is evident upon this account. All thoſe actions, or tranſactions, aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt in the Major Propoſition, as <hi>viz.</hi> his diſcovering and detecting unto the <hi>Saints</hi> the hoſtile Spirit and machinations of Satan againſt them, his furniſhing them with ſpirituall weapons to conflict with him, and fight againſt him, &amp;c. are in ſeverall places of <hi>Scripture</hi> plainely reported, and attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, particularly in theſe: <hi>Jam. 4. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 8, 9. Eph.</hi> 6. 11. 12, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Cor. 11. 3. 14. &amp; 2. 11. Mat.</hi> 12. 43, 44, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Theſs. 2. 9, 10. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 5. (not to mention many others.) Now if the <hi>Saints</hi> be in no poſſibility of being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally overcome by Satan, or of miſcarrying in the great and moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant buſineſſe of their Salvation, by his ſnares and ſubtilties, all that oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and diligence of the Holy Ghoſt in thoſe late-mentioned addreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his unto them, in order to their finall conqueſt over <hi>Satan,</hi> will be found of very light conſequence, of little concernment to them. Yea, if the ſaid addreſſements of the Holy Ghoſt, be compared with the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Saints,</hi> as the ſaid Doctrine of Perſeverance repreſenteth and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it to be, and be digeſted or formed into an hypotypoſis accordingly, the utter uſeleſſeneſſe and impertinency of them, will yet much more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare. Suppoſe we then the Holy Ghoſt ſhould ſpeake thus unto the <hi>Saints: O you</hi> that truly believe, who, by vertue of the Promiſe of that God that cannot lie, are fully perſwaded and poſſeſt, that you ſhall be kept by God by His irreſiſtible Grace, in true faith until death, ſo that though <hi>Satan</hi> ſhall ſet all his wits on work, and by all his ſtratagems, ſnares, and cunning devices, ſeek to deſtroy you; yea though he ſhould intice you away from God by the allurements of the World, and intangle you with them againe, yea and ſhould cauſe you to run, and ruſh headlong, againſt the light of your own judgements and conſciences, into all manner of horrid ſins, and abominations, yet ſhall all his attempts and aſſaults upon you in every kinde, be in vaine; you ſhall be in never the more danger, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of periſhing; unto you, I ſay, attend and conſider, how ſore and dangerous a combate you are like to ſuſtaine: for you are to wraſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:94900:189"/> leſt the Tempter ſhould any wayes tempt you, and my labour about you be in vaine. Therefore watch, pray, and reſiſt him ſtedfaſt in the Faith: take unto you the whole Armour of God, that you may be able to reſiſt in an evill day, and having done all things, ſtand faſt: ſtand, having your loynes girt with the girdle of truth, and the breſt-Plate of Righteouſneſſe upon you, &amp;c. Would ſuch an Oration or ſpeech as this, be any wayes worthy the infinite Wiſdome of the Holy Ghoſt? Or is it not the part of a very weak and ſimple perſon, to admoniſh a Man, and that in a moſt ſerious and ſolemn manner, of a danger threatning him, or hanging over his head, and withall to inſtruct and teach him with a great variety of Rules, Precepts, and Cautions, how to eſcape this danger, when as both himſelf knows, and the perſon admoniſhed likewiſe knoweth (and this with the knowledge alſo of the Admoniſher) that it is a thing altogether unpoſſible that ever the danger ſhould befall him, or the evill, againſt which he is ſo ſolemnly cautioned, come upon him? Therefore they who make the Holy Ghoſt to have part and fellowſhip in ſuch weakneſſe as this, are moſt inſufferably injurious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>And whereas they ſtill plead (or pretend rather) that ſuch admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> as thoſe lately ſpecified, may well ſtand with an unconditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned promiſe of Perſeverance, we have formerly ſhewed <note n="a" place="margin">See from Sect 4. of this Chapter, to the end of Sect. 16.</note>, that they are not able to make good this Plea, nor to give any reaſonable account of it. Whereas they adde, that their Sence or Opinion is not, that it is a thing abſolutely, or every wayes impoſſible for true Believers to fall away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, or finally, from their Faith; but that they willingly grant, that even true Believers, what through their own weakneſſe, and what through the ſubtil baits and temptations of <hi>Satan,</hi> may ſo fall away, &amp;c. I anſwer, that this is but a Fig-leafe ſought out to cover the nakedneſſe of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which hath no ſtrength at all, nor wear, in it. For what though it were in a thouſand other reſpects never ſo poſſible for true Believers to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; yet if it be altogether unpoſſible in ſuch a reſpect, which over rules all thoſe other, and which will, and of neceſſity muſt, hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to paſſe, all thoſe other notwithſtanding, it is to bee judged ſimply and abſolutely, impoſſible: and all thoſe reſpects, wherein it is pretended poſſible, are not to be brought into account, in ſuch a caſe. The Rule in the Civill Law (and in Reaſon) is: <hi>Omnia invalida nihilo ſunt aequiparanda:</hi> i. e. All things, which [together] are invalid, are to be judged as none at all. Yea, the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf, when it ſpeakes of any thing, which God hath promiſed, or ingaged Himſelfe to bring to paſſe, though there be never ſo many ſecond cauſes, and theſe never ſo potent in their kinde, to oppoſe it, it nullifies the validity of all theſe, and aſſerts the certaine futurity of the effect, upon ſuch termes, as if in no reſpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it were impoſſible, or obnoxious to a <hi>non</hi> being, or <hi>non</hi>-comming to paſs. <hi>If God</hi> BE FOR US (ſaith <hi>Paul) who can be against us</hi> 
               <hi rend="sup">a</hi>? clearely<note place="margin">b Rom. 8. 31.</note> implying, that no enmity, no oppoſition, or interpoſition of things, or perſons, whatſoever, againſt our Comfort and Peace, are of any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at all, when we have the Power of God ingaged for our ſecurity. And is there not altogether the ſame reaſon of the Perſeverance of the <hi>Saints,</hi> in caſe God hath made an abſolute Promiſe hereof unto them? Or is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, or any wayes conſiderable, to ſay, that in this reſpect, or in that reſpect, or in a third reſpect, they may poſſibly not Perſevere, in caſe it be ſuppoſed that God hath abſolutely, peremptorily, and irreverſibly,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:94900:189"/> againſt all poſſible Interveniences whatſoever, Decreed their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance?</p>
            <p>Whereas ſome pretend, that <hi>Christ</hi> Himſelfe was tempted, who yet<note place="margin">§. 39.</note> was in no danger of ſinning, or of periſhing; the anſwer is, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a truth, but palpably irrelative to the cauſe in hand. It would have parallel'd, in caſe the Holy Ghoſt ſhould have applied Himſelf unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> in ſuch admonitions, detections of <hi>Satans</hi> malice and methods againſt him, exhortations to be watchfull, to pray, to ſtand faſt, and reſiſt him, with profeſſing himſelf afraid leſt <hi>Satan</hi> ſhould circumvent him, &amp;c. as thoſe, wherein we heard he addreſſeth himſelf unto Believers; but there being no ſuch applications as theſe made unto him by the Holy Ghoſt, the caſe is altogether different. It is true, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Man, was ſubject to the whole Law of God, and to every branch and particular Precept thereof, ſo far as it concerned him, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo far as it concerned Men, conſidered ſimply as Men, or as righteous and good Men: but as it relates unto Men, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſubject to morall weakneſſes and infirmities, or as in a capacity of being over-grown and overcome with ſinfull corruptions, and ſo liable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to periſhing, he was not in ſubjection to it. Nevertheleſſe it is not to be denied, but that even <hi>Christ</hi> Himſelf conſidered ſimply as Man, had upon him the image and ſuperſcription of a Creature or finite Being, I meane, mutability; yet ſo, that all potentiality in him in this kinde was abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly balanced, over-balanced, by the hypoſtaticall union, and the unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureableneſſe of that Grace, which flowed from this Spring, upon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his humanity; by means whereof, there is an impoſſibility, though neither meerly Logicall or Naturall, nor yet meerly Morall, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and (as it were) mixed of both (ſuch as hath no place in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any meere Creature, whatſoever) that he ſhould be actually changed to the dayes of eternity. So that in reſpect of the perſonall union with the God-head, even <hi>Christ</hi>-man, is to be looked upon as ſimply and abſolutely unchangeable (a Prerogative Royal, wherein neither <hi>Saints,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Angels,</hi> have part with him.) And becauſe of ſuch an unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him, though otherwiſe he was a ſubject capable enough of being tempted, yet was he not a perſon meet to be intreated, or dealt with, by the Holy Ghoſt, upon thoſe terms of Admonitions, Cautions, Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations unto Watchfulneſs, Conſtancy, or ſtanding faſt, Informations of danger threatning him, in caſe he ſhould not quit himſelf worthily, &amp;c. wherein he frequently turneth himſelf unto the <hi>Saints</hi> and true Believers (as we heard.)</p>
            <p>Nor is that neceſſity of doing Righteouſneſs, and Obeying God, which<note place="margin">§. 40.</note> reſted upon the Will of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the means aforeſaid, any whit prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the merit, or rewardableneſs, of what he did and ſuffered in the fleſh; though it be moſt true, that any ſuch neceſſity, which ſhould cauſe the wills of Men (other Men) neceſſitatingly, or unavoydably to act righteouſly, would be deſtructive to the rewardableneſs of what they ſhould act upon ſuch terms. The reaſon of the difference, is, becauſe, in caſe any ſuch neceſſity of well doing, ſhould come upon, or be found in the wills of meere Men, they muſt neceſsarily be paſſive herein, in as much as they have no Native or inward Principle of their own, whereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or induce any ſuch neceſſity upon themſelves: and what Men are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to doe in a Paſſive way, wants the <hi>ratio formalis,</hi> the eſsentiall property of what is rewardable, either by the rules of Wiſdome, or Juſtice.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:94900:190"/> See more upon this account, Sect. 19. of this Chapter. But that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which reſted in, or upon the Will of <hi>Christ,</hi> of doing righteouſly, (though it was not a meere logicall or irreſiſtible neceſſity neither, as was lately intimated) but ſuch as it was, it was contracted by himſelf, and that voluntarily and freely, the God-head or the Divine Nature, perſonally united with the humane, (which was as much, as properly, as eſſentially <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the humane Nature it ſelf, in this union) voluntarily and freely deriving unto the humane, ſo united unto it, ſuch a fulneſs of Grace, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Goodneſs, from which that neceſſity we ſpake of, of well-doing, in a way of a genuine and kindly reſult, aroſe upon him, and abides with him for ever. No meere Creature having the like opportunity, or means; of veſting the like neceſſity of well doing in it ſelf, it followeth upon a very faire account, that in caſe it were, or could be, ſuppoſed that they (meere Creatures I meane) were unavoydably neceſſitated to doe well, ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of theirs ſhould be uncapable of reward; although it be otherwiſe in the caſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of that unparallelable neceſſity of well doing, which was found in him. I ſhall only add one Argument more: and therewith conclude this Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Doctrine, which naturally and directly tendeth to beget, and foment</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 41. <hi>Argum. 9.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>jealouſies, and evil ſurmiſes betweene Brethren in Christ, or ſuch as ought cordially to Love, Reverence, and Honor, one another, is not confederate with the Goſpell, nor from God: and conſequently, that which contradicteth it, muſt needs be a Truth. The common Doctrine of unqueſtionable and unconditioned Perſeverance is a Doctrine of this tendency; apt to beget and foment jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, ſuſpicions, and evill ſurmiſes betweene Brethren, or ſuch as ought to love and reſpect one the other, as Brethren in Chriſt, &amp;c. Ergo.</hi> The Major in this Argument, will (I ſuppoſe) meet with no adverſarie: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs no ſecond. The Minor ſtandeth firme and ſtrong upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. That Doctrine which teacheth and perſwadeth me to judge the Faith and love of thoſe, whom I ought cordially to love and honour as <hi>Saints,</hi> and Brethren in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to be no better, then the Faith and love of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, Diſſemblers, formall Profeſſors, &amp;c. directly tendeth to beget jealouſies, and evill ſurmiſes in me againſt them, and is of the ſame ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to occaſion them to meaſure back againe the ſame meaſure towards me. The common Doctrine of peremptory Perſeverance thus teacheth, and perſwadeth, both me and them. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Major here alſo feares no contradiction, and ſo craves no aſſiſtance. The reaſon of the Minor is; becauſe I cannot reaſonably judge either the Faith, or love of thoſe, whom I ſtand moſt bound by the Law of <hi>Christ,</hi> to Love, Reverence, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as <hi>Saints,</hi> and Brethren, to be better, greater, or more ſincere, then ſometimes I judged, or at leaſt ought to have judged, that Faith and Love of thoſe, to have been, whom the Doctrine we ſpeake of, teacheth me to judge to have been Hypocrites and falſe-hearted, even then, when their Faith and love were at the beſt. For the very truth is, that amongſt all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> that are at preſent any wayes known unto me (and I make no queſtion but that every other Chriſtian of any conſiderable ſtanding in the World, may with a good conſcience profeſſe the like of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) there is not any one, who I can reaſonably judge to be either more ſound in Faith, or ſincere in love, both towards God, and Men, then I ſometimes judged, and that upon competent grounds, yea the beſt that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I then was, or yet am, capable of, ſome others to have been, whom

Therefore if upon, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of, their Apoſtaſie, I ſtand bound to judge them to have been in the beſt of their ſpirituall ſtandings, no better then Hypocrites; it is unpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but that I ſhould be jealous and ſuſpicious at leaſt, leſt the beſt and greateſt Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that are known to me in all the World, ſhould be no better then Hypocrites alſo, notwithſtanding any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or ſatisfaction they give, or poſſibly can give unto me, of their ſincerity.</p>
            <p>If it be replied, that even that Doctrine which I teach, in oppoſition to that other, hath a like tendency to create and nouriſh amongſt the <hi>Saints</hi> reciprocally, if not the ſame jealouſies and evill ſurmiſes, which have been charged upon the other, yet others every whit as bad, or however, not much better then they; in as much as this Doctrine it ſelfe, teacheth <hi>Saints</hi> to looke one upon another, as thoſe that may Apoſtatize, and turne enemies unto Chriſt and the Goſpell. And is not ſuch a jealouſie as this concerning any perſon, every whit as <hi>Unchriſtian,</hi> hard, or uncharitable, as to look upon him as a poſſible Hypocrite? To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p>That a jealouſie or ſuſpicion of a preſent vileneſſe, or unworthineſſe in a Man, eſpecially when he that is ſuſpicious, hath all the beſt grounds that can be given why he ſhould not be ſuſpicious in this kinde, is a far worſe and more <hi>Unchriſtian</hi> jealouſie and ſuſpicion, then that which is conceived againſt a Man touching any future unworthineſſe, that onely poſſibly may be found in him. The Doctrine which teacheth a poſsibility onely of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and finall defection in the <hi>Saints,</hi> doth not invite, or occaſion any Man, to judge concerning any <hi>Saint</hi> or true Believer; that he will, or that he is likely ſo to fall, but onely that it is poſsible for him ſo to fall. Nor is ſuch a judgement, or thought as this, concerning any Man, yea or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatſoever, any jealouſie or ſuſpicion at all concerning him, nor hath it any thing reflective, or diſparaging in it, to the Worth, Honour, or Repute of that Creature, how great and worthy ſoever he be, concerning whom it is conceived; it being no diſparagement at all, no not to the firſt borne of Creatures, I mean to the Angels themſelves, not to partake, or not to be thought to partake, in any incommunicable property of God, ſuch as his unchangeableneſſe is. To look upon a <hi>Saint,</hi> or a true Believer, as one who may poſsibly Apoſtatize, is but to looke upon him as being a Creature, and not God: nor would ſuch an eye as this offend the greateſt <hi>Angell</hi> in Heaven, conſidering that he never gave, nor is capable of giving, any competent ground or reaſon unto any Man to look upon him with any other. But to looke upon a <hi>Saint,</hi> or true Believer, eſpecially when he hath given all the Chriſtian ſatisfaction that reaſonably can be deſired, or expected, of his uprightneſſe and ſincerity, as one, that for ought we can tell, or have any ſufficient ground to judge the contrary, may be an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, and rotten at the core, is an high ſtraine of Unchriſtian unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, and what reaſon it ſelfe, competently informed, cannot lightly but abhor.</p>
            <p>The Premiſſes concerning the ſubject yet in hand (the Doctrine of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance) duly conſidered, it fully appeares, that that Doctrine, which for theſe many yeares laſt paſt hath magnified it ſelf in the Tongues and Pens of Men, not onely or ſimply for a Truth, but with many great <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giums,</hi> and titles of Soveraigne dignity, as that it is a fundamentall Article
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:94900:191"/> of the Reformed Religion, one of the principal Points or Heads of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, wherein the Reformed Churches have purged themſelves from the Errors of Popery, that it is the foundation of all true aſſurance of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which true Faith it ſelf cannot ſtand; that it contains that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, which all Miniſters of the Goſpel ſtand bound to commend, and inculcate with all diligence into all true Beleevers for their comfort, with many ſuch like ſtudied and ſtrained-for commendations; this Doctrine (I ſay) in whoſe praiſes the Friends of it have riſen up ſo early, and lifted it up ſo neer unto the Heavens; as hath been ſhewed, upon a ſtrict and unpartial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and examination, hath been found a meer Impoſtor, an appearance of Satan in the likeneſs of an Angel of Light, a Tenent which cannot ſtand in Judgment with the ſound and wholeſom Doctrines of the Goſpel. We ſhall further (God willing) ſhew unto you, in how little requeſt the ſaid Doctrine of Perſeverance was with thoſe, who are to this day counted Pillars of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith in the Primitive and moſt exemplary times; and likewiſe how unſtable and uncertain, if not unſatisfied alſo, the greateſt Friends, and learnedſt Abettors of it in latter times, (or at leaſt thoſe, who are commonly taken for ſuch,) have been in their Judgments about it. In the <hi>interim</hi> we ſhall onely, in order to the further clearing up of the truth againſt the miſt of the ſaid Doctrine, give you a brief account from the Scriptures themſelves of ſome Examples, who with their own Declinings ſealed the truth of that Doctrine, which hath been maintained hitherto, concerning the poſſibility of a total Declining in the Saints.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous engagement: nor that any ſuch are wont to fall away, though this be extreamly probable, and a borderer to that which is evident and unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable: nor yet that any have actually and <hi>de facto</hi> ſo fallen away, which is our preſent engagement; but onely to evince the truth of ſuch Grounds and Reaſons, whether from the Scriptures, or from the nature and conſideration of the things themſelves, from which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being granted, the ſaid Poſſibility perfectly appeareth, and becomes viſible to the eyes of the judgments and underſtandings of men. Nevertheleſs, ſince the eviction of this aſſertion, that ſome, formerly Saints and true Beleevers, have <hi>de facto</hi> totally fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, is ſo pregnant a Proof of the Poſſibility that ſuch may ſo fall away, I judged it both worth my labour, and the Readers conſideration, to preſent what the Scriptures hold forth upon that account.</p>
            <p>Let us firſt inſiſt upon the Example of <hi>David;</hi> concerning whom no man (I preſume) queſtioneth, but that He was as true and real a Saint and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, before the Perpetration of thoſe two horrid ſins, one upon the neck of another, Murther, and Adultery, as He was after His Repentance of, or for, thoſe Perpetrations. For, 1. that ſignal teſtimony of being <hi>a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:94900:191"/> to Gods own Heart,</hi> was given unto Him by God Himſelf, before He committed theſe ſins, as appears from <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 22. compared with <hi>Pſal. 89. 20. 1 King.</hi> 14. 8. In the firſt of theſe places it is ſaid: <hi>And after He had taken Him away, He raiſed up David to be their King, of whom He wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, ſaying, I have ſound David the ſon of Jeſſe, a man after mine own Heart, which will do all things that I will.</hi> This, with the other places mentioned, clearly ſpeak of the frame and temper of <hi>Davids</hi> Heart, and of the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of His Perſon unto God, at the time of His anointing, and inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the Kingdom: whereas it is evident that the two great ſins ſpecified were committed by Him many years after he had been King. Beſides, there are many pregnant Arguments in the Scripture, of <hi>Davids</hi> integrity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before God, before that great eclipſe of the glory of them, whereof we ſpake. But we ſhall not need to inſiſt upon any thing in this kind: our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themſelves, in the cauſe depending, generally acknowledg him to have bin a man truly godly and regenerate, before the guilt of the two enormous ſins mentioned clav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> unto Him. The Queſtion is, Whether He continued ſuch, truly Godly, under the guilt of the ſaid ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> from the time of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration of them, until the time of His Repentance: They affirm, I deny; and give this account of my Denyal in oppoſition to their Affirmation.</p>
            <p>

But this Propoſition (I conceive) hath ſo much light of truth ſhining upon it from the Scriptures, that they who deny the Concluſion, will not deny it.</p>
            <p>For the Major; this hath been ſufficiently argued and proved in the former Chapter, in our traverſe of the fifth Argument, there propounded to prove a Poſſibility of a total defection in the Saints, Sect. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21, &amp;c. where like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all the Pleas of exception, commonly made againſt it, were largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and anſwered to the full. I ſhall here onely add this brief Argument for the further confirmation of it. <hi>Whoſoever is truly godly, hath by Grace and Promiſe from God, a Right and Title to the Kingdom of God.</hi> This Propoſition is current Doctrine amongſt our Adverſaries. Therefore I aſſume: <hi>But whoſoever commits Murther and Adultery, and this againſt the light of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with deliberation and premeditated contrivance, and remains impenitent under the guilt of ſuch commiſsions, during ſuch His impenitency, hath no Right or Title to the Kingdom of God. Ergo.</hi> This is proved <hi>ex abundanti<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> from <hi>Gal. 5. 21. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. (places formerly argued.) Touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Apoſtle, after a large enumeration of the <hi>works</hi> of the fleſh, <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs,—Envyings, Murthers, &amp;c.</hi> ſubjoyns: <hi>of the which I tell you before, as I have alſo told you in time paſt, that</hi> THAT WHICH DO SVCH THINGS, SHALL NOT INHERIT THE KINGDOM O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> GOD. The other place is of the ſame import. So likewiſe are the Paſſages <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 5, 6. It ſeems this was a Doctrine frequently incultated by the Apoſtle into the mindes and conſciences of ſuch as were Saints, (at leaſt ſo judged and reputed by Him,) and therefore ſuch, as we ought to judg to have been none
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:94900:192"/> other. Now if thoſe, who formerly had been Saints, and in this capacity, Heirs of the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> ſhould have retained the ſame capacity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the doing of the things mentioned, and before any remorſe of Soul, or Repentance for them, the Apoſtle could not, either with reaſon, or truth, have pronounced this heavy doom againſt them, that they <hi>ſhould not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> So that <hi>David</hi> having done two of the moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and vile works of the fleſh, in the Practiſe or Perpetration of Murther, and Adultery, and that (as hath been ſaid) with circumſtances of greateſt aggravation, doubtleſs for the time whileſt He remained impenitent, in, or under, the defilement of them, was obnoxious to that Law of Death, by which the workers of iniquity, or of the works of the fleſh, are ſentenced with the deprivation, or loſs, of their Right and Title to the Kingdom of Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſequently was not a godly perſon, or accepted with God. We have already profaned all thoſe lawleſs Sanctuaries, at which, Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purſued by the Scriptures lately mentioned, are wont to take ſhelter, as, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the ſaid places are not to be underſtood as applicable unto the Saints, (they mean, ſuch as at any time have been Saints,) but unto natural or unregenerate men onely. 2. That Saints have an abſolute Promiſe from God, that they ſhall never totally loſe their Faith. 3. That the Saints ſin onely out of infirmity, and not premeditatedly, or with full conſent: Theſe Alledgments, with their fellows, we have once and again in ſeveral places, upon occaſion, clearly detected to be of the ſpurious and ignoble race of ſhifts and evaſions, fought out by men for the gratification and relief of Error, and to obſtruct the Truth in the courſe of it, that it might not <hi>run, and be glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome object, that <hi>David</hi> prayed unto God, during his impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> under the ſaid ſins; and that this is a ſufficient proof, that He was all the while a Perſon truly Godly, and endued with Juſtifying Faith. I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. It no where appears that <hi>David</hi> did pray unto God, during the term of His impenitency, or until <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet came unto Him, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken His Conſcience unto a conſideration of them. The 51 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which is indeed Precatory and Penitentiary, is, in the Title, ſaid to have been made by <hi>David, when Nathan the Prophet came unto Him, (i. e.</hi> upon his coming unto Him,) <hi>after He had gone in to Bathſheba.</hi> Which implies, that <hi>David</hi> was now in a Poſture of Repentance, when He conceived the Prayer expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither from one act of Prayer, nor from many, can the truth or ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any mans Faith be concluded. Our Saviour Himſelf ſuppoſeth that Hypocrites pray, and that often <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 6. 5</note>: Yea, and that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were wont to <hi>make long Prayers</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 23. 14</note>; and affirmeth, that they were liable to the <hi>greater damnation,</hi> upon the account of theſe Prayers, in reſpect of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ends intended in them. Yea, men may pray unto God with ſome degree, or kinde, of acceptation with Him, whileſt they are yet but unregenerate men, as ſome of our Adverſaries themſelves, more conſidering then their fellows, do acknowledg. Nor doth that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Without Faith it is unpoſsible to pleaſe God</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 11. 6</note>, any ways contradict it: of which place, we ſhall (I conceive) have occaſion to ſpeak more at large hereafter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It it yet further the Doctrine and ſence of our Adverſaries, That Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates themſelves may have, and many times have, ſome excellent gifts of the Spirit conferred upon them; and, among others, the gift of Prayer it ſelf. So that were it granted, or could it be proved, that <hi>David,</hi> under His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:94900:192"/> for His crying ſins, did pray, or was wont to pray, unto God, it cannot be inferred from hence, that therefore He was not in an eſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, or deſtitute of the ſaving Grace, or Favor of God. It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that He that totally falls away from ſaving Faith, ſhould be, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the ſudden, deveſted or diſpoſſeſt of any, much leſs of all, ſuch gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which are conſiſtent with an eſtate of Reprobation or Unregeneracy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If <hi>David</hi> was a true Beleever during the time of His <hi>wallowing in the mire</hi> of thoſe two foul crimes (oft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mentioned) then was not His <hi>waſhing</hi> by Repentance, neceſſary to His Salvation. The reaſon is, becauſe true Faith giveth a ſufficient Right and Title to Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is the main ſtream and current of the Goſpel, that <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But if <hi>Davids</hi> waſhing by Repentance, was not neceſſary to His Salvation, how can the Holy Ghoſt be juſtified in ranging <hi>Murtherers and Whoremongers</hi> amongſt thoſe, who <hi>ſhall have their part in the lake, which burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which is the ſecond death</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note>? or in ſaying, that <hi>no unclean thing ſhall enter into it</hi> [the new Jeruſalem,] <hi>neither</hi> WHATSOEVER <hi>worketh abomination</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 27.</note>? or, that <hi>without are Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Verſe 15.</note>? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainly <hi>blood deſileth</hi> a Perſon, as well as a Nation, or <hi>Land</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Num. 35. 33</note>, when it is unrighteouſly ſpilt in it, and maketh as well the one, as the other, <hi>unclean,</hi> until it be attoned. And for the ſin of Adultery, it is ſufficiently known that the Holy Ghoſt preſents it (almoſt) every where, as polluting and defiling. So that <hi>David,</hi> during His impenitency aforeſaid, was cut off from all right of entering into the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> both by the general ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity of uncleanneſs, as alſo by the particular incapacities of Murther, and Adultery.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If <hi>David</hi> were a true <hi>Beleever,</hi> during the time of His departure, and<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> abſence, from God, then may the teſtimony of former and by-paſt works of righteouſneſs be accepted by way of proof, for the truth and ſoundneſs of any mans Faith, againſt the teſtimony of later, and more-preſent fruits of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, againſt it. If ſo, then, 1. No man, that hath approved himſelf a good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> formerly, ought upon any change whatſoever, upon the moſt Unchriſtian miſcarriages that can be imagined, to be judged an Apoſtate from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or conſequently, be, upon any juſtifiable grounds, caſt out, by the ſentence of Excommunication, from any Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Which ſuppoſed, No Church, duly and regularly deporting it ſelf in the admiſſion of Members, are in any capacity of uſing the ſaid ſpiritual Sword, in any caſe, or upon any occaſion whatſoever. For certain it is, that no perſon, who either is, or ought to be judged by the Church, a true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ought, by this <hi>Church,</hi> to be cut off from his Body, or to be delivered unto <hi>Satan:</hi> and as certain it is, that no perſon ought to receive admiſſion into any <hi>Church,</hi> which is not looked upon by this Church as a true Member of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 2. The ſaid Poſition admitted for truth, whereas the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> demandeth, <hi>What doth it profit, my Brethren, though a man ſay He hath Faith, and</hi> HAVE <hi>not Works</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">James 2. 14.</note>, He might as well (or rather) have ſaid, <hi>and hath not had works?</hi> For, by the Tenor of the ſaid Doctrine, though a man wants preſent works, or works of a later edition or performance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to <hi>ſhew</hi> or manifeſt the truth of his Faith unto men, yea, though his later works give never ſo pregnant or loud a teſtimony againſt the truth of his Faith, yet if he can but ſay, and make proof, that formerly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though never ſo long before, he hath been fruitful in well doing, this muſt be looked upon
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:94900:193"/> as ſufficiently demonſtrative of his Faith. Which is notoriouſly contrary to the manifeſt bent and ſcope of the Apoſtles diſcourſe in that place. 3. If the caſe were ſo, that mens former works, if good, muſt be heard againſt their later works, though never ſo bad, there is no place or poſſibility left, either for Hypocriſie, or Apoſtacy, amongſt men, eſpecially not for this latter. For no man is to be judged an Apoſtate, but He that declines from the Faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which ſometimes He profeſſed, and gave ſufficient ground unto men by his works, to conceive and judg that He really was poſſeſſed of, and held. So then if ſuch a mans former good works, be ſtill to be judged valid in their teſtimony concerning the goodneſs of his Faith, how evil and vile ſoever his after-works ſhall be, evident it is that ſuch a man ought not to be eſteemed an Apoſtate, but a Perſeverer in the Faith, though his ways and actions ſhould degenerate into the higheſt ſtrain of wickedneſs, or ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that can be imagined. 4. (And laſtly, for this) that Paſſage from God Himſelf by His Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> (formerly opened,) <hi>But when the righteous turneth away from His righteouſneſs, and committeth iniquity, and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth, ſhall He live? All His righteouſneſs that He hath done ſhall not be mentioned: in His</hi> TRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PASS <hi>that He hath treſpaſſed, and in His</hi> SIN <hi>that He hath ſinned, in them ſhall He dye</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 24</note>; this paſſage (I ſay) plainly evinceth, that the eſtimate, which is to be made of men in point of righteouſneſs, and unrighteouſneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, of Faith, and Unbelief, is not to be made by the import, or rule, of their former works, but of their latter; no not though the former have been many, and the latter, but few. For the Text ſaith, <hi>In His Treſpaſs</hi> (in the ſingular number) <hi>that He hath treſpaſſed,—ſhall He dye;</hi> implying, that any one ſin, of that kinde of ſins, which the Scripture calls, <hi>abominations,</hi> whileſt unrepented of, tranſlateth him from life unto death, caſteth Him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtate and condition of an Unbeleever.</p>
            <p n="6">6. (And laſtly) If <hi>Davids</hi> Repentance, after the Perpetration of the foul and horrid ſins mentioned, was not ſimply neceſſary to His Salvation, (and conſequently, Himſelf, during His impenitency, a man of death,) Gods ſending His Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> unto Him to awaken Him, and raiſe Him up by Repentance, will be found to have little Grace, Love, or Mercy in it, or at leaſt far leſs, then ſuch a neceſſity of His Repentance ſuppoſed, would derive upon it. Evident it is from the Tenor of the Meſſage, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet brought from God unto Him, that His Repentance did not exempt Him from Temporal Judgments. <hi>Wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, to do evil in His ſight? Thou haſt killed Uriah the Hittite with the ſword, and haſt taken his wife to be thy wife, and haſt ſlain Him with the ſword of the children of Ammon. Now therefore the Sword ſhall never depart from thine Houſe.—Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold, I will raiſe up evil againſt thee out of thine own Houſe, and I will take thy Wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy Neighbor, and He ſhall lie with thy Wives in the ſight of this Sun. For thou didſt it ſecretly: but I will do this thing before Iſrael, and before the Sun</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 12 9, 10, &amp;c.</note>. From whence, together with the event every ways anſwering (as the proceſs of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Hiſtory makes manifeſt) it is clear, that <hi>Davids</hi> Repentance did not ſanctuary Him from <hi>troubles in the fleſh,</hi> and outer man; no not from ſuch, which were very ſore, and grievous to be ſuffered. Nor can it be ſaid that it did deliver Him from the wrath which is to come, in caſe it be ſuppoſed that He was a true Beleever immediately before, and at, the time of His Repentance: becauſe, this ſuppoſed, He was not liable unto this <hi>wrath,</hi> nor in danger
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:94900:193"/> of ſuffering it: in which caſe, His Deliverance from it, is to be aſcribed, not to His preſent Repentance, but to His precedent Faith.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be ſaid, that Gods ſending <hi>Nathan</hi> unto <hi>David</hi> upon ſuch<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> terms of Grace, as have been mentioned, argueth any Election from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>David,</hi> perſonally or particularly conſidered, though it be true, that He doth not vouchſafe the like terms of Grace, or means of Repentance, unto all other ſinners. Becauſe, 1. If <hi>David</hi> was a true Beleever, and ſo in an eſtate of Grace, when <hi>Nathan</hi> came unto Him, He was under the wing of Election, and in the way of Life and Salvation: and conſequently His ſending to Him by God, did neither argue <hi>pro,</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> ſuch His Election. 2. There might be ſome equitable conſideration on <hi>Davids</hi> behalf, though not known unto us, on which God might ground a Diſpenſation of more Grace and Mercy towards Him, then towards other ſinners, in whom the like conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not to be found. For though we affirm and hold, that Reaſons in the general may be given, even by men, to evince an equitableneſs, or reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in all the ways of God, yet we do not ſay but that there are many ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and particular Reaſons of His actions and ways, which are known onely to Himſelf, and are not aſſignable by men. That God delt equitably by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in vouchſafing unto Him thoſe ſignal means of Repentance, which He did; and that He deals as equitably by ſuch ſinners, to whom He denyeth the like means, may be clearly proved from the nature and import of that Great Attribute of His, which the Scripture calls <gap reason="foreign">

               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 17</note>, or a non-accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Perſons, as likewiſe from that equality in all His ways, which the Scripture with no leſs evidence aſſerteth <note n="b" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 25 29.</note>. But why, or how, it ſhould be equitable in Him, to make ſuch a difference between <hi>David,</hi> and many other ſinners, between whom notwithſtanding He maketh it, may very poſſibly be indemonſtrable by men: becauſe all the qualifying circumſtances on <hi>Davids</hi> ſide, or of <hi>Davids</hi> ſins, are not known unto men, as they are unto God: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are all the aggravating circumſtances of the ſins of other ſinners known unto them, as they are alſo unto Him. Which conſidered, evident it is, that God may have, yea and queſtionleſs hath, equitable and reaſonable grounds, and theſe in, or from, the Perſons themſelves, and their ways, between whom He maketh any ſuch difference, as that now in diſcourſe, though theſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigable, or <hi>paſt finding out</hi> by men. And why <hi>God</hi> ſhould <hi>not give a reaſon,</hi> or account, [<hi>i. e.</hi> a ſpecial or particular account] <hi>of any of His mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> (as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaketh <note n="c" place="margin">Job 33. 13</note>,) the reaſon is ſo neer at hand, that I ſhall not need to bring it any whit neerer by naming it, or by inſiſting upon it.</p>
            <p>3. (And laſtly) in caſe there ſhould be found any other ſinner whatſoever, like unto <hi>David</hi> in all circumſtances relating unto ſin, and righteouſneſs, it is little queſtionable, but that, in like caſe of guilt and preſent impenitency, means of like grace and efficacy (though not literally, or formally the ſame) in order to his Repentance, would be vouchſafed unto him, which were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond Old-Teſtament inſtance of a total recidivation from Grace, or<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> true Faith, we finde in <hi>Solomon.</hi> That <hi>Solomon</hi> before His fall by Idolatry, and other ſinful miſcarriages (of which more preſently) was a true Beleever, a regenerate man, a ſon of God, is the conſtant Opinion of thoſe that teach an impoſſibility of a total falling away from Grace: I do not know any one of them otherwiſe-minded. However, His Writings being ſo full of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wiſdom and Knowledg, as they are on all hands confeſſed to be, give a liberal teſtimony unto their Author, that He was a man truly fearing God,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:94900:194"/> and held communion with Him. And <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſaith, that <hi>among many Nations there was no King like unto Him: for He was</hi> BELOVED OF HIS GOD <note n="a" place="margin">Neh. 13. 26</note>, &amp;c.

The ſad Hiſtory of His wickedneſs, is drawn up by the Holy Ghoſt Himſelf, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. where, having reported His diſobedience to the Law of God, by which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were prohibited to marry with the Daughters of a ſtrange God, in taking unto him no fewer then ſeven Hundred Wives, and three Hundred Concubines, of the women of the <hi>Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, &amp;c.</hi> and withall, the ſeveral abominable Idolatries, wherewith he came to be polluted hereby, he adds, that <hi>His Heart was not perfect with the Lord His God, as was the Heart of David His Father: that He did that which was evil in the ſight of the Lord: that He went not fully after the Lord, as did David His Father: that the Lord was angry with Him, becauſe His Heart was turned from the Lord God of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> I am no enemy to their Opinion, who affirm that <hi>Solomon</hi> returned back again to <hi>the Lord God of Iſrael</hi> by way of Repentance: but aſſuredly during all that wallowing in the mire mentioned, under the pollution and guilt of all thoſe abominations charged by the Holy Ghoſt upon him, his back was towards him, and his perſon under the dint of that heavy doom, which is denounced againſt Idolaters, and all that work abomination, <hi>viz.</hi> excluſion from the Kingdom of God, (as hath been largely ſhewed already.) The nakedneſs of ſuch allegations and waſhy pretences, which are commonly layd hold on to make <hi>Solomon</hi> a true Beleever, and ſon of God, during his moſt dreadful Apoſtacy from him (lately deſcribed) hath been detected, both in the laſt preceding Chapter, as likewiſe in the late examination of <hi>Davids</hi> caſe.

            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> (ſay they) could not fall away totally from his Faith, nor from<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> the ſaving Love of God, becauſe God had promiſed unto <hi>David</hi> his Father,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:94900:194"/> that he <hi>would be a Father unto Him</hi> [his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi>] and that he ſhould be <hi>a Son unto Him:</hi> and that <hi>His Mercy ſhould not depart from Him; as He took it from Saul</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 14 15.</note>. I anſwer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Evident it is, that <hi>the Mercy,</hi> or kindneſs of God, here mentioned, was vouchſafed by him, as well unto <hi>Saul,</hi> as unto <hi>Solomon.</hi> For his Promiſe is, that he would not take away his mercy, or kindneſs, (as ſome tranſlate) from the latter, as he took it [<hi>i. e.</hi> the ſame mercy] from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> former, <hi>Saul.</hi> If then <hi>the Mercy</hi> here ſpoken of, was the ſaving Mercy of God, out of which he purpoſeth to give Eternal Life, then <hi>Saul</hi> was Elect, and a childe of God, and yet fell totally and finally away, and had this Grace, or <hi>Mercy,</hi> of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, <hi>taken from Him.</hi> If it be a mercy, or kindneſs, of any other kinde, the infiſting upon it is altogether irrelative to the buſineſs in hand.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When God faith, that <hi>His Mercy ſhould not depart from Solomon,</hi> the meaning clearly is, that God would not tranſlate the Kingdom into another Family, or Line, as he had transferred it from <hi>Saul</hi> and his houſe, but would continue it in <hi>Davids</hi> Line by <hi>Solomon.</hi> The words immediately following, make the face of this interpretation to ſhine. <hi>And thine</hi> HOVSE, <hi>and thy Kingdom ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever before thee: thy Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 16</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, it appears from words ſpoken by <hi>David</hi> unto his Son <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> a little before his death, that he underſtood the mercy, or kindneſs, promiſed unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> not of the ſaving <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſence of our Oppoſers, is unremovable where ever it be once pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but of ſuch a Mercy, as hath been declared. <hi>And thou, Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve Him with a perfect Heart, and with a willing minde. For the Lord ſearcheth all Hearts, and underſtandeth all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the thoughts: if thou ſeek Him, He will be found of thee: but if thou forſake Him.</hi> HE WILL CAST THEE OFF FOR EVER <note n="c" place="margin">1 Chro. 28. 9</note>.

            <p>Nor is that, which was thought upon by a great man in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 8.</note> of any whit more value, to prove the <hi>ſtanding</hi> of <hi>Solomon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Faith, whileſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>fell</hi> ſo foully (as we have heard.) It is the teſtimony, which <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf gives concerning himſelf, in theſe words: <hi>Alſo my wiſdom remained with me</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Eccleſ. 2, 9</note>. From hence this Author judged it a legitimate inference, that <hi>Solomon</hi> remained ſound in his Faith, whileſt he halted right down, yea, and fell deſperately (as we have heard) before God. But (as the Proverb is) <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles habent labra lactucas,</hi> like lips, like lattuces: ſuch as this mans Cauſe is, ſuch is his Argument, or Plea for it. For what is there in the words cited, any ways to <hi>juſtifie Solomons</hi> Faith, whileſt himſelf fell into that fearful <hi>Condemnation,</hi> which hath oft been declared? It is true, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſometimes in Scripture ſignifies, the true, ſound, and ſaving Knowledg of God, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Religious frame of heart, inclining a man to a conſciencious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all the Laws and Precepts of God. But unleſs it could be proved, that it always is found in one of theſe two ſignifications, and never in any o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, (which is a task that would prove a reproach to any mans parts and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſhould undertake it,) it is no ways reaſonable to put either of theſe upon it in the place in hand. For there is nothing more clear, then that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeaketh here of that <hi>wiſdom,</hi> which (as he faith in the former Chapter, Verſ. 13.) he <hi>gave his heart to know,</hi> and which confiſteth in the obſervation,

And having particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larized ſeveral of his principal enjoyments in this kinde, Verſ. 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. he concludes from the ſaid Inventory, or Survey, Verſ. 9. thus: <hi>So I was great, and increaſed more then all that were before me in Jeruſalem;</hi> adding, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo my wiſdom remained with me,</hi> [in the Original, ſtood by me, or to me,] meaning, that he was very circumſpect and careful, not to deſtroy, maim, or prejudice, that Principle of Wiſdom, which he had travelled ſo long for, and by which he had raiſed himſelf to a far greater eſtate, in honors, riches, pleaſures and contentments in the World, then any other man; careful (I ſay) he profeſſeth himſelf to have been, not to endamage or prejudice this his wiſdom, by thoſe abundant pleaſures and delights, whereof he ſtood poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd, and which he freely enjoyed, as many are apt to do upon ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by ſuch means.

Then I ſaid in my heart, that this alſo is vanity.—and how dyeth the wiſe man, as the fool! &amp;c.</hi> So that by the <hi>wiſdom,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>remained with him,</hi> in the fulleſt enjoyment of the delights and contentments of the world, is clearly meant, not a ſacred, but a politique or civil wiſdom, which firſt he gave his heart to ſeek, and afterwards, having obtained it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, to the rendering of his condition in the world every ways as deſirable, as the materials of the world, under the beſt improvement, would make it. And beſides, evident it is from what hath been ſaid, and from the carriage of the Context, both before, and after, (and indeed from the ſcope and purport of the whole Book) that <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the place in hand, doth not ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his latter times, wherein he turned aſide after Idols, and ſaid to the ſtock, or graven image, <hi>Deliver me: for thou art my God</hi>

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:94900:195"/> Idols, and Idolaters, the Father had ſaid before, <hi>They that make them, are like unto them, [i. e.</hi> as Mr <hi>J.

               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 115, 8</note>. Therefore (queſtionleſs) the Son, after his return from that <hi>folly,</hi> would not have pleaded the <hi>ſtanding of his wiſdom by him,</hi> whileſt He was an <hi>Idolater,</hi> and Patron of <hi>Idols.</hi> But the truth is, that the words inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are every ways ſo inconſiderable in point of Proof, for the continuance of <hi>Solomons</hi> Faith during his continuance in his Idolatries, that the recourſe made to them for proof hereof, is an Argument to me very conſiderable, that the Patrons of that Opinion are extreamly ſtraitened and put to it, through want of ſo much as any tolerable Argument or Proof, for the maintaining of it. It is a ſign that the <hi>Soul is hungry</hi> indeed, when every <hi>bitter thing</hi> becomes <hi>ſweet</hi> unto it.</p>
            <p>Thus then we clearly finde, that there is no ſpecial or particular ground, or Argument at all, of any value, to prove, that either <hi>David</hi> the Father, during his impenitency after the horrid crimes of Murther and Adultery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated by him, or that <hi>Solomon</hi> the Son, during the like impenitency in him upon his Idolatrous backſlidings, did retain any ſaving Principle of grace, or Faith, in them; but that, during their reſpective impenitencies, they were children of wrath, liable to the ſame ſentence of Condemnation with the promiſcuous multitude, or generality of Murtherers and Idolaters, for the Proof whereof ſeveral pregnant Arguments have been levyed from the Scriptures. As for ſuch Arguments and grounds, by which the certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance of the Saints (in general) in the truth and ſoundneſs of their Faith, is commonly pleaded and maintained, they have been formerly weighed in the balance of the Sanctuary, and found too light. So that we may very ſafely conclude, that both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> were not onely under a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of a total falling away from that grace of God, wherein they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtood, (which is common to all the Saints,) but that they taught the World the truth and certainty of ſuch a Poſſibility, by reducing it into act, I mean by falling away totally from it.</p>
            <p>Neither are Examples of the like ſad Miſcarriages wanting in the New-Teſtament.<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome in his days, who <hi>having put away a good Conſcience, concerning Faith, made ſhipwrack</hi>

For the firſt: If we ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they, who <hi>put away a good Conſcience</hi> from them, had it, or were poſſeſſed of it, before ſuch their putting it away, we muſt ſuppoſe withall, that they had true ſaving Faith: becauſe <hi>goodneſs of Conſcience</hi> cannot take place, but onely where ſuch a Faith gives Being unto it: which in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is ſaid to <hi>purifie the heart</hi>

            <p>Concerning the two places, which are commonly inſiſted upon, to prove<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> that <hi>a good Conſcience</hi> in Scripture, doth not always ſignifie a Conſcience, Chriſtianly, Spiritually, or Savingly <hi>good,</hi> but ſometimes Morally <hi>good</hi> onely, <hi>i. e.</hi> which is not defiled, or diſturbed in the peace of it, with ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt knowledg, (which goodneſs of Conſcience is ſometimes found in meer Civil, or Natural men) though deſtitute of Evangelical illumination; the truth is, that neither the one, nor the other, of them, proveth any ſuch thing. In the former of theſe places, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh thus: <hi>Men and Brethren, I have lived in all good Conſcience before God until this day</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 23. 1</note>. In the latter, thus: <hi>I thank God whom I ſerve from my forefathers with pure Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 3</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For neither of theſe places do neceſſarily, nor ſo much as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, relate to the time of <hi>Pauls</hi> Phariſaiſm, as if his meaning were, that all that time he had kept <hi>a good Conſcience</hi> towards God, (for how could He then with truth, or ſingleneſs of heart, have made this Confeſſion; <hi>Of ſinners I am the chief</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15</note>?) but to the time of his Apoſtleſhip, or Profeſſion of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> as appears clearly from the former place, upon this account. <hi>Paul</hi> was accuſed by the Jews, as an Apoſtate from the Religion of his Forefathers, and the true Worſhip of God (as they ſuppoſed) and that He was fallen from Judaiſm to the Sect of <hi>Christians,</hi> yea, and was become a Ringleader of them. This they conceived to have been an high miſdemeanor in Him, and accuſed Him as a very wicked and ungodly Perſon, for ſo doing. To this Accuſation and Crime objected the Apoſtle anſwers to this effect, Men and Brethren, whereas I have forſaken the Religion and Worſhip of the Jews, and have embraced, and do yet embrace, the Chriſtian Religion in ſtead of it, I have done nothing, I do nothing herein, but upon very juſtifiable grounds, and with <hi>a good Conſcience,</hi> in as much as I have obeyed God in ſo doing; of which I am ready to give you a perfect Account, if you pleaſe to hear me. This to be the true purport and drift of the Apoſtles words, the ſequel of the Context makes yet more apparant. For upon the hearing of the words in debate, uttered by Him, <hi>Ananias</hi> the High<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prieſt was ſorely offended, and commanded the ſtanders by to <hi>ſmite Him on the mouth,</hi> for ſo ſpeaking. Now it is no ways reaſonable to conceive, that He would have taken it ſo heinouſly that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay, that He had always <hi>lived in all good Conſcience before God,</hi> whileſt he profeſſed <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> and before He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Chriſtian. Such a ſaying as this would rather have gratified and pleaſed, then offended Him. But that He ſhould ſay, that He <hi>lived with all good Conſcience</hi> in the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, this was a ſword that paſſed through <hi>Ananias</hi> Soul.</p>
            <p>For the other place, where the Apoſtle ſaith that He <hi>ſerved God from His</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Forefathers with a pure Conſcience,</hi> His meaning onely is, that he ſerves none
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:94900:197"/> other God, but Him, whom His Forefathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> worſhiped, and that Him he ſerved with <hi>a pure Conſcience,</hi> as they alſo did. To qualifie the Jews, who took great offence at Him for changing His Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and withall to make this Practice of His more paſſable with others, He oft recourſeth to this Apology, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the Profeſſion of <hi>Christianity,</hi> he ſerves no other God, but the God of his Forefathers. See <hi>Acts 22. 14. &amp; 24. 14. &amp; 26. 7. &amp;</hi> 28. 20. &amp;c. In this ſence <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets the place in hand, on which he hath theſe words (amongſt others, of like import,) <hi>Certain it is, that Pauls Conſcience was not always pure, in as much as himſelf confeſſeth, that through hypocriſie he was deceived, when he indulged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a liberty of lusting. For whereas</hi> Chryſoſtom <hi>excuſeth his Phariſaiſm, in that he oppoſed the Goſpel out of ignorance, and not out of malice, it no ways ſatisfieth. For the elogy</hi> [or, commendation] <hi>of a pure Conſcience, is not vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> or common; <hi>neither can it be ſeparated from the ſincere and ſerious fear of God. Therefore I reſtrain</hi> his words <hi>to the preſent time, thus: that he worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one and the ſame God with his Forefathers: but now, ſince he was enlightened by the Goſpel, he worſhipeth Him with a ſincere affection of heart</hi>

            <p>Beſides, that <hi>Faith,</hi> of which <hi>ſome</hi> are ſaid to have <hi>made ſhipwrack,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be ſuppoſed to have been a feigned, counterfeit, or pretended <hi>Faith</hi> onely, nor any thing accompanying deſtruction; becauſe it is ſuch a <hi>Faith,</hi> which the Apoſtle exhorts and encourageth <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>hold faſt, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, and a good Conſcience, which ſome having put away, concerning Faith,</hi> (which I adviſe thee to <hi>hold</hi> and keep) <hi>have made ſhipwrack.</hi> Doubtleſs the Apoſtle would not have perſwaded <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>hold,</hi> or keep, ſuch a <hi>Faith,</hi> with which he might periſh: Nor had the <hi>making ſhipwrack</hi> of no better a commodity then ſo, been any ſuch great loſs unto Him. 3. That <hi>Faith,</hi> which He exhorteth <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>hold,</hi> muſt needs be ſuppoſed to be that <hi>Faith,</hi> which He was poſſeſſed of at preſent, and which was now in Him. And that this was a true <hi>Faith,</hi> appears from ſeveral Paſſages in the two Epiſtles written by this Apoſtle unto Him, eſpecially from thoſe words, <hi>When I call to remembrance</hi> THE UNFEIGNED FAITH <hi>that is in thee, which dwelt firſt in thy Grandmother Lois</hi>

And it is generally granted by thoſe, who by <hi>Faith,</hi> in the place in hand, will needs underſtand the Doctrine of the Goſpel, that men, who are no <hi>good Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who are deſtitute of ſound and ſaving <hi>Faith,</hi> may yet <hi>hold,</hi> yea <hi>hold</hi> faſt, the Doctrine of the Goſpel, yea, and this to the ſuffering of death it ſelf for it.

Therefore (doubtleſs) it came not neer the thoughts of this Author to conceive, that any other Faith ſhould be meant in the place in hand, but onely that which was <hi>true and unfeigned.

His words upon this account (to ſave tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription) are to be ſeen towards the end of the 9. Sect. of this Chapter. <hi>J. Deodat,</hi> in his pious Annotations upon the Bible, interpreteth the word <hi>Faith,</hi> (in the Paſſage in hand) as his words are Engliſhed, thus: <hi>Faith;</hi> viz. <hi>ſufficient Knowledg, full Aſſurance, and</hi> SINCERE <hi>Profeſsion of the Truth of the Goſpel.</hi> So that there is not onely ground upon ground, reaſon upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to demonſtrate, that by <hi>Faith,</hi> in the Scripture under conſideration, muſt needs be meant a true, ſolid, and ſincere Faith, and not the bare Doctrine of Faith onely; but Author upon Author alſo, and Expoſitor upon Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, and theſe Orthodox, to avouch the ſame Interpretation. Therefore the firſt of the two Particulars mentioned, is unqueſtionable: <hi>viz.</hi> that that <hi>Faith,</hi> whereof the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>ſome made ſhipwrack,</hi> was a true juſtifying Faith, and ſuch, wherein had they perſevered unto the end, would have been accompanyed with Salvation.</p>
            <pb n="358" facs="tcp:94900:198"/>
            <p>The latter, we ſhall not need to inſiſt upon, it being generally granted by our Adverſaries, that by <hi>making ſhipwrack</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> here ſpoken of, what Faith ſoever it be, is meant the utter, abſolute, and total loſs of it.

So that the Proof hereof would be but an impertinency. That the <hi>Faith</hi> here ſaid to have been <hi>overthrown</hi> by the Doctrine menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, was a true juſtifying <hi>Faith,</hi> appears clearly from the Context. In the Verſe next before, the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>And their word will eat</hi> [or fret] <hi>as doth a canker, of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus.</hi> Now it is the nature and property of this ulcerous diſeaſe, not to prey, feed upon, or conſume, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the corrupt humors, or putrified members of the body, which would tend rather to its preſervation, then deſtruction, but thoſe eſpecially that are moſt vital and ſound, yea, and this to the extinguiſhing life it ſelf. <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place affirms this, as the judgment of all Phyſicians. <hi>All Phyſicians</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>affirm this to be the nature of a</hi> [cancer, or] <hi>gangrene, that without very preſent help</hi> [againſt it] <hi>it ſpreads to the parts adjoyning, and eats into the bones themſelves, and gives not over its prevailing progreſs, until the man dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For in as much as upon a gangrene, a mortification, or ſyderation preſently followeth, which very ſuddenly with their contagion infect the other parts, to the univerſal deſtruction of the body,</hi> Paul <hi>elegantly compareth adulterate</hi> [or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous] <hi>Doctrines to ſuch a pernicious contagion. For if you ſhall once give way unto them, they will proceed and prevail to the destruction of the whole Church</hi>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:94900:198"/> of what He had ſaid concerning <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> their forſaking of the Truth, and the <hi>overthrow</hi> of the <hi>Faith of ſome</hi> others by means of their Error. The Scruple, or Objection, is this: If ſuch men of note profeſſing the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, as <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> were, grew out of liking of that Faith, which ſometimes they profeſſed, and forſook it, and beſides, prevailed with ſome others alſo, to relinquiſh their Faith, are not we in danger of falling away likewiſe, and ſo of loſing all that we have either done, or ſuffered, hitherto, in a Chriſtian Profeſſion? To this Objection, or Scruple, the Apoſtle, in the words now in Hand, anſwereth to this effect. That notwithſtanding the falling away of men, who ever, or how many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, yet the Glorious Goſpel, and Truth of God therein, ſtands, and always hath ſtood, firm, ſtedfaſt, and inviolable: which Goſpel hath the matter and ſubſtance of this ſaying in it, as a Seal, for the eſtabliſhment and ſecurity of thoſe that are upright in the ſight of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, [i. e.</hi> takes ſpecial notice of, approveth, and delighteth in] <hi>thoſe that are His, [i. e.</hi> who truly beleeve in Him, love, and ſerve Him;] yea and further, hath this <hi>Item,</hi> or Heavenly Admonition in it, tending to the ſame end (the firm eſtabliſhing of thoſe that are Gods, in the way of their Faith) <hi>Let every one that calleth upon the Name of Chriſt [i. e.</hi> makes Profeſſion of His Name] <hi>depart from iniquity.</hi> So that in this Anſwer to the Scruple or Demand mentioned, the Apoſtle intimateth (by way of ſatisfaction) that the reaſon why men fall away from the Faith of the Goſpel, is, partly, becauſe they do not ſeriouſly conſider what gracious and worthy reſpects God beareth to thoſe that <hi>are His, (i. e.</hi> who cleave to Him in Faith and Love;) partly alſo, becauſe they degenerate into looſe and ſinful courſes, contrary to the Law im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Goſpel, upon all thoſe in eſpecial maner that profeſs <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> and conſequently that there is no ſuch danger of their falling away, who ſhall duly and throughly conſider the one, and conſcienciouſly obſerve the other. In aſſerting the ſtability of the Truth of God in the Goſpel, by way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt the fears of thoſe, that may poſſibly ſuſpect it, becauſe of the defection of others from it, He doth but tread in His own footſteps elſewhere; as, <hi>viz.</hi> where He ſaith (as He doth a few Verſes before, in this very Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,) <hi>If we beleeve not, [i. e.</hi> though <hi>we</hi> men <hi>beleeve not,</hi> what He hath promiſed,] <hi>yet He abideth faithful; He cannot deny Himſelf</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 13</note>; as if He ſhould ſay, the Unbelief of men, whether of thoſe who never ſo much as pretended to Beleeve in Him, or of thoſe who have revolted from their Faith, ought not in reaſon to be ſo conſtrued, or looked upon, as if they were any Argument or Proof, that therefore God ſhould be unfaithful, or untrue, conſidering that it is altogether incompoſſible with His Nature and Being, <hi>to deny Himſelf, [i. e.</hi> either to ſay in words, or to import by action, that He is not a God; the latter whereof He ſhould do, in caſe He ſhould promiſe, and not perform accordingly, though it be too too well conſiſtent with the nature of men thus to <hi>deny</hi> Him.] So likewiſe where He ſaith (to the ſame Point,) <hi>What if ſome did not beleeve? ſhall their Unbelief make the Faith of God without effect</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 3. 3</note>? <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhall the Unbelief of men be interpreted as any toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Argument or ground to prove, that God is unfaithful; or (which is the ſame) that He hath no other, no better Faith in Him, then that which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miſcarrieth, and produceth not that, for which it ſtands engaged? im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that ſuch an interpretation as this, is unreaſonable in the higheſt. But to give a little further light to the Scripture opened, <hi>Nevertheleſs the foundation of God ſtandeth,</hi> and to the interpretation lately given, it is to be
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:94900:199"/> conſidered, that the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, tranſlated, <hi>foundation,</hi> doth not onely<note place="margin">See <hi>Sam. Petit Var. Lectionum</hi> lib. 1. c. 11</note> ſignifie the foundation of an Houſe, Building, or the like, but a band, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in writing, whereby He that lendeth money, or intruſteth goods, unto another, is wont to be ſecured by him who borroweth, or is intruſted, that he ſhall duly receive, what he hath contracted for with him. Such a writing or inſtrument as this, is a kinde of politique or civil <hi>foundation,</hi> on which the Creditor builds a rational Hope, or expectation, of receiving from His Debtor what is equitably, and upon Promiſe, due unto Him. Now that the Apoſtle in the words in Hand, rather alludeth to ſuch a <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> as this (if it muſt be ſo called) then unto that other, is very probable (at leaſt) from hence; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe to this latter kinde of <hi>foundation</hi> (which I call Politique, or Civil) <hi>ſealing</hi> is moſt proper; whereas it cannot be aſcribed unto the other, but by a very unproper, ſtrained, uncouth, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of attribution. For who hath heard of the ſealing of a <hi>foundation</hi> of an Houſe, or Building? or to what end or purpoſe ſhould ſuch a <hi>foundation</hi> as this be ſealed? But Writings for the ſecurity of Contracts, or Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, between man and man, are by the cuſtom of (almoſt) all Nations, wont to be <hi>ſealed,</hi> yea and are not authentique, or valid in Law, unleſs they be ſealed. So that by <hi>the ſure,</hi> or firm, <hi>foundation of God,</hi> which is ſaid to <hi>ſtand</hi> (how faſt ſoever men <hi>fall</hi> from the Belief of it) queſtionleſs is meant that gracious Contract, or Covenant, made by God with the World, to give Life and Salvation to all thoſe that ſhall beleeve in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is now exhibited in writing unto thoſe concerned in it, Men, as a <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> for all men to build an Hope and expectation of Life and Salvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the Tenor and terms of it. This Foundation is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) becauſe it never failed any Perſon that built upon it. It is ſaid to have <hi>this Seal, The Lord knoweth who are His,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firmneſs, or ſtability of it, is further confirmed unto men, by that perfect knowledg, declared and aſſerted in it, which God taketh, and hath, of all thoſe who truly beleeve, whereby they become appropriately <hi>His;</hi> by means of which Knowledg and Approbation, He is in a perfect capacity, to make this ſignal difference between them, and others who beleeve not, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from their Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſave the one, and to deſtroy the other, when time comes. Again, it is ſaid to have this <hi>Seal</hi> alſo, <hi>Let every one that nameth the Name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity,</hi> becauſe the ſaid Truth, and ſtedfaſtneſs of it, is yet further commended and ratified unto men by the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the Commandments</hi> given in it unto thoſe, that profeſs the Name and Faith of <hi>Christ.</hi> A Promiſe, or Covenant, of Life and Salvation, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore likely to be from God, and conſequently, to be ſtable and firm, becauſe it requires ſuch an excellency of life and converſation, of all thoſe, who expect benefit by it.

               <note place="margin">§. 15. Cap. 10.

               <note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 19, 28</note>, <hi>Judas</hi> was, as well in reſpect of the inward frame of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:94900:199"/> His heart, as of his outward converſation, in the ſame capacity, with the reſt of the Apoſtles, of <hi>ſitting upon a Throne</hi> to <hi>judg the twelve Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> i. e. of being ſaved. This opinion of his concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> he argues and proves from the ſaid Promiſe; which (he judgeth) cannot be verified, unleſs it be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Judas,</hi> one of the twelve, was at this time under the grace of it, and in ſuch a relation and condition God-ward, wherein had he perſevered, he ſhould actually have been a partaker of the glory promiſed, with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. We took knowledg likewiſe (in the place related unto) that <hi>P.

We ſhall not need to argue the caſe of <hi>Demas, Alexander, Hymeneus,</hi> and ſeveral others, whoſe revoltings from the Faith, are recorded in Scriptures. Concerning the two latter of the three now mentioned, <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> it is expreſly ſaid, that they were <hi>delivered up unto Satan</hi> by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 20</note>. Which plainly ſheweth, 1. That they were judged meet by the Saints to be received as Church-members by them. For otherwiſe the Apoſtle demands, <hi>What have I to do to judg them that are without</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 12</note>? meaning, to inflict any Eccleſiaſtical or Church-cenſure upon thoſe, who were not Members of ſome Chriſtian Church, or other. And if they were judged meet by the Saints of that Church, who admitted them into Chriſtian communion with them, they were judged true Beleevers by them: and their judgment of them as being true Beleevers, is a far better ground for us to judg them to have been ſuch alſo, then their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy is, to judg them to have been Hypocrites, at that time, when they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them true Beleevers. 2. Their <hi>delivering up unto Satan</hi> by the Apoſtle ſheweth, that he judged them totally fallen from their faith, and ſo diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for otherwiſe he ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> have <hi>delivered up unto Satan</hi> ſuch perſons, whom he judged true Members of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> There is the like conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Inceſtuous Perſon in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> His receiving into this Church, is more then a probable argument that he was at this time a true Beleever. Nor is there the leaſt intimation given of any difference between him, and the reſt of the Members of this Church, whom the Apoſtle termeth <hi>Saints by calling,</hi> and, <hi>ſanctified by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And if he were not a true Member of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> before the committing of the ſin, for which he was <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up unto Satan</hi> by the Apoſtle, He ſuſtained no great loſs in his ſpiritual condition, either by committing the ſaid ſin, or by being ſo <hi>delivered up</hi> for it. For upon this ſuppoſition, he was no better then an Hypocrite before, and worſe he could not lightly be afterwards. And beſides, the tenor and import of the ſentence of Excommunication, is not declarative, that the perſon ſentenced never was a ſound Beleever, or true Member of <hi>Christ,</hi> but that now by his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſdemeanor, whereby he incurreth that ſentence, he hath diſmembered himſelf from Him. Nor can the ſaid ſentence be duly ſtiled a <hi>delivering up unto Satan,</hi> if it muſt be ſtill ſuppoſed, that the perſons juſtly ſentenced here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, had been always before the ſaid ſentence, as much under his power, as
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:94900:200"/> they are, or can be, afterwards. So that all circumſtances conſidered, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be judged, but that the perſon now in inſtance, had ſometimes been a true Member of Chriſt, and Beleever. But that he ſinned away this his bleſſed Relation, by that ſin, for which he was <hi>delivered up unto Satan,</hi> needs no other proof, but the Apoſtles expreſs order for this ſentence to paſs upon him. 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 3, 4, 5. For I verily as abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit, have determined already, as though I were preſent, that he that hath done this thing, when ye are gathered together, and my ſpirit, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ſuch an one, I ſay, by the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, be delivered unto Satan, &amp;c.</hi> Doubtleſs this Apoſtle, who profeſſeth that he <hi>could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the truth, but for the truth,</hi> never conſented, much leſs commanded, that any true Member of Chriſt ſhould <hi>be delivered unto Satan.</hi> But (as hath been ſaid) the cauſe in hand ſtandeth in no need of confirmation from theſe examples; the ſerviceableneſs whereof for ſuch a purpoſe, may poſſibly be evaded with more plauſibleneſs of pretence, then the former. Any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a total declining in him, who hath at any time been a true Beleever, is ſufficient to prove the truth of the Doctrine under maintenance: yea (as was ſaid in the beginning of this Chapter) though no ſuch inſtance could be produced, yet may the ſaid Doctrine receive demonſtrative evidence, and this in abundance, otherwiſe: and (I truſt) hath received it from the Premiſſes in this Diſcourſe. Yet give me leave to add one inſtance more.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Galatians,</hi> unto whom the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, any man<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> that ſhall diligently peruſe the Epiſtle written unto them, cannot lightly but conclude, that certainly theſe men, (I mean the generality of them, and more particularly thoſe, for whoſe ſake eſpecially the Epiſtle was written) were ſometimes (<hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> left them, after he had preached the Goſpel for a while unto them) true Beleevers, and perſons juſtified in the ſight of God; and afterwards (<hi>viz.</hi> when he wrote the Epiſtle unto them) had ſuffered a total loſs of their Faith, and of Juſtification by it. That they were ſometimes true Beleevers, theſe paſſages compared, and layd together, are ſufficiently pregnant (I conceive) to give ſatisfaction unto any duly conſidering man. <hi>I marvel that ye are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you into the Grace of Christ, unto another Goſpel</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 1. 6.</note>.

On the other hand, ſeveral of the ſaid paſſages, with ſome others, do as plainly and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly ſuppoſe, that at the writing of the ſaid Epiſtle unto them, they were wholly alienated from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and had neither part nor fellowſhip in the great buſineſs of Juſtification by him.

Amongſt other weapons of this warfare, the Arrow of this reproach is moſt frequently unquiver'd, and let fly: if men can finde that any Opinion, which hath the leaſt ſemblance, or ſympathy, though but in ſound of words onely, with that, which oppoſeth theirs, hath either been held by any former Heretique, or Perſon voted Erroneous, or elſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:94900:202"/> by thoſe, unto whoſe lot it is fallen to be ſirnamed Orthodox, they make an importune outcry againſt this Opinion (I mean, which oppoſeth theirs) as if it were nothing but an old infamous Error, held onely by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques and Erroneous Men, but ſtigmatized and caſt out of the Church by the Orthodox, long ago. The truth is, that neither the one conſideration, nor the other, no not when they are real, and not in pretence or preſumption one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (I mean, neither the aſſerting of an Opinion by men in many things er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, nor the diſ-owning of it by men in moſt things, and in the main, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,) are any demonſtrative grounds of the unſoundneſs of this Opinion, or that it is not from God. How much leſs, when that Opinion indeed, which ſuffers rebuke from men upon ſuch terms, was neither taught, nor held, by the one, nor rejected, or oppoſed, by the other, but onely an Opinion in ſome outward lineaments ſomewhat like unto it, but in heart, and ſubſtance of matter, altogether differing from it? The Doctrine of Election, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination unto Life, from foreſeen Faith, or Works, is commonly decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made odious unto men upon this pretence, that it was a Doctrine held by <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> and condemned and caſt out of the Church for an Error, by all the Orthodox Fathers, long ſince. Whereas it is evident from the Records of Antiquity, that the Opinion concerning Predeſtination from foreſeen Faith, or Works, which was held by the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> and rejected by the Orthodox Fathers, was not ſimply this, that God Predeſtinated thoſe unto Life, whom He foreſaw would beleeve, or live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, but, whom He foreſaw would beleeve, or live holily, <hi>out of the ſtrength or abilities of Nature.</hi> The Orthodox Fathers themſelves held, and taught, Predeſtination from foreſeen Faith, and Holineſs, as well as the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> but with this difference: The Fathers taught it, from the foreſight of ſuch a Faith and Holineſs, which men ſhould be enabled unto by Grace: the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> from ſuch, whether Faith, or Holineſs, which men ſhould raiſe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit by the ſtrength of Nature. This is evident from what <hi>Gerardus Voſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> a diligent and faithful Surveyor of Antiquity, demonſtrateth in the ſixth Book of his <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hiſtory. <hi>The Greek Fathers</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>always, and all the Latine Fathers, who lived before</hi> Auſtine, <hi>are wont to ſay, that they are Predestinated unto Life, whom God foreſaw would live godlily, and well; or, as ſome others ſpeak, whom He foreſaw would beleeve, and perſevere, who ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on Him to Eternal Life,</hi> (1 Tim. 1. 16.) <hi>Which they ſo interpret, as to ſay, that Predeſtination unto Glory is made</hi> [by God] <hi>according to His foreknowledg of Faith and Perſeverance. But they did not mean the foreſight, or foreknowledg of ſuch things, which a man was to do by the abilities of Nature, but by the ſtrength and aſsistance of Grace, as well preventing, as ſubſequent. So that this conſent of Antiquity, no ways helpeth, either the</hi> Pelagians, <hi>or</hi> Semi-Pelagians [in their cauſe.] <hi>For both theſe held, that the cauſe of Predestination is aſsignable on mans part, according to all the effects of it: whereas the Orthodox Fathers acknowledg, that the firſt</hi> [or, preventing] <hi>Grace, is conferr'd, not of merit, but freely.

                  </gap>fore that eternal Election cannot rightly be inferred from Faith, they do not all ſpeak of any meaſure, or degree of Faith whatſoever, ſince many of them diſtinguiſh three ſeveral degrees of Faith. The firſt of which gives Eſſence, or Truth of Being unto Faith, in reſpect whereof it juſtifieth, and is called a lively Faith: oppoſite hereunto is a dead and putati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious [i. e.</hi> an imaginary] <hi>Faith, which is proper to Hypocrites. The next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree adds Duration,</hi> [or Perſeverance,] <hi>in reſpect whereof it ſaveth, [i. e.</hi> becomes actually ſaving:] <hi>Oppoſite to this Faith, is that which we commonly call, Temporary, (attributing that unproperly unto mens Faith, which the Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to men themſelves,) which is the Faith of Apoſtates. The third</hi> [and laſt] <hi>degree, ſuperaddeth Solidity: this Faith is termed perfect, ſolid, rooted, which at any time of a mans life gives him aſſurance;</hi> i. e. (<hi>to uſe the words of</hi> Gregory <hi>the Great) doth ſo confirm</hi> [or ſtrengthen] <hi>that a man cannot fall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and knoweth this moſt certainly of himſelf. To this degree of Faith, a weak Faith is oppoſed, which is the Faith of many of the Elect. Thoſe paſſages of the Fathers, wherein they ſay, That true Faith may be lost, but is always recovered again, always ſpeak of the ſecond degree of Faith. But thoſe, where they ſay, That ſuch Faith cannot be loſt, must neceſsarily be underſtood of the third and higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Faith. Between which expreſsions, and what they generally teach otherwiſe,</hi> viz. <hi>That many periſh eternally through a falling away from their Faith, there is no repugnance. For in ſuch aſſertions as this, they underſtand Faith of the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> i. e. <hi>ſuch a Faith, which is formally and eſſentially true, or (which is the ſame) which is juſtifying, though not</hi> [actually, or in the event] <hi>ſaving, but juſtifying in the eſſence or ſubſtance of it, in reſpect whereof a man is at preſent, righteous or just; not juſtifying, in reſpect of continuance, ſince if we conſider the Truth of the end, that Faith is not truly justifying, which at any time ceaſeth to juſtifie: becauſe no other Faith hath the promiſe of eternal life, but only that, which perſevereth.</hi>

            <pb n="370" facs="tcp:94900:204"/>
            <p>By the expreſs tenor of theſe things, it fully appears, that the uniform and<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> conſtant opinion of all Orthodox Antiquity, was, that true Faith, true Grace, true Juſtification, and forgiveneſs of ſins, may, by ſecurity, careleſſneſs, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and profaneneſs of life and converſation, be totally and finally loſt, and the perſons, in whom they were ſometimes found, eternally periſh. As for that which ſome of them teach, concerning the inamiſſibility, or infallible Perſeverance of ſuch a Faith, which is perfected and radicated in the Soul ſo throughly, and to ſuch a degree, as we have heard expreſſed, were it granted that they ſpeak of a ſimple and abſolute inamiſſibility in this kind, and that their meaning is, that there is an utter impoſſibility, and not a great difficulty, or improbability only, that ſuch a Faith ſhould miſcarry, or, no inſtance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to prove, that ſuch a Faith ever did miſcarry, it no ways rebuketh the confidence of that Aſſertion, which we have in this preſent Chapter, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the Diſcourſe formerly, avouched; <hi>viz.</hi> That a poſſibility of the falling away of true Saints, and true Beleevers, and that both totally, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, was the general and joynt Doctrine of the Primitive Chriſtians for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ages together after <hi>Christ.</hi> The conſideration whereof is abundantly ſufficient to ſtop the mouth of that undue pretext, which preſumeth to ſay, and that with confidence, That the beſt and moſt conſcientious men were always of this Judgment, that true Grace is imperiſhable, and true Beleevers under no poſſibility of miſcarrying finally. But of this we ſpake more at large in the nineth Chapter. I here only add: That when any of the ancient Fathers, or Councils, expreſs themſelves in words of any ſuch import as this, that there is, or may be, a Faith ſo raiſed, rooted, or ſtrongly built, that it cannot, either totally, or finally miſcarry, it is no ways probable that their meaning ſhould be, that there is an utter, ſimple, or logical impoſſibility, that ſuch a Faith ſhould be wholy loſt, but that they rather ſpeak rhetorically, and would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a kind of moral impoſſibility only, which imports a great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, improbability or rareneſs of an event: in which ſence, or notion, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves (as knowledg hath been given elſewhere <note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 10. §. 28. &amp; Cap. 12 Sect. 29.</note>, are wont to term things, unpoſſible, or ſuch, which cannot be.</p>

For I do not bewail the overthrow of a</hi> City, <hi>or the</hi> captivity <hi>of ungodly men, but the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſacred Soul, the destruction, utter defacement and demolition of a Temple, wherein</hi> Chriſt <hi>dwelt. For He that had throughly known that furniture</hi> [or,

This was a more Holy Temple, then that.

As for thoſe Quotations from this Father, by which he ſeeks to perſwade the world into a conceit, that he was as far out of the way of Truth about the Doctrine of Perſeverance, as himſelf, there is not any one of them that gives any diſtinct ſound that way. We have formerly, in this very Chap. ſhewed you upon a clear account under the Authors own hand, how thoſe, and all like paſſages found in his Writings, are to be underſtood, if we deſire to underſtand them in his ſence, and with a conſiſtence to his Judgment in other places.</p>

            <p>How a Doctrine of that ſoveraign import in Chriſtian Religion, of that<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> pregnant aſſertion in the Scriptures themſelves, ſo generally and conſtantly held forth and maintained by Orthodox Antiquity, as the Doctrine of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Perſeverance hath in all theſe reſpects been clearly proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be, ſhould be, eſpecially with ſo much heat, and confident zeal, denyed and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a great party of the Reformers of Religion in theſe latter days, is of ſomewhat a ſtrange, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut of a much more ſad, conſideration.

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:94900:211"/> or through a badneſs of their ſight, ſwept up among the ſoyl, and caſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it upon the dunghil; ſo may it very poſſibly fall out in great Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Religion, when corruptions, and matters requiring Reformation, whether in Doctrine, or Manners, are very numerous, and of a long gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that together with the corruptions, Errors, and things neceſſary to be removed, and abandoned, ſome things alſo of worth, and good import, and which appertain to the purity and ſoundneſs of Religion, are renounced, and caſt out likewiſe, partly through too much zeal of an over-haſty diſpatch in the work, partly through an injudiciouſneſs in ſome things, in the principal Reformers; partly through that infirmity of incogitancy, which is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune an attendant upon fleſh and blood, how vigilant ſoever. Or as it conſtantly falleth out in purgings and lettings of blood, that together with the bad humors, and corrupt blood, ſomewhat of that which is good, and ſerviceable for the health and ſtrength of the body, is parted with, and loſt: ſo is it hardly to be expected, but that when an attempt ſhall be made to purge the body of Chriſtian Religion, being now encumbered and over-grown with Errors, unſound Notions and Opinions having inſinuated into the veins, and incorporated themſelves (as it were) with the pure ſubſtance of it, (which was the condition of it, by falling into the hands of, and remaining ſo long amongſt, thoſe Daemoniolatrical Apoſtates, whoſe want of love to the Truth, God avenged by <hi>ſending them ſtrong deluſions,</hi> which cauſed <hi>them to beleeve lyes,</hi>) ſomewhat of the ſoundneſs and native ſubſtance of it alſo ſhould be divided from it, and caſt into the draught together with that excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and noiſom matter, which is wrought out of it by the purge.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, if we ſhall limit our Diſcourſe to the Point in hand,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> and onely ſpeak of the Doctrine of Perſeverance, the truth is, that a very conſiderable part of thoſe, who were intereſſed in the Reformation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about <hi>Luthers</hi> times, and who ſince maintain and carry on that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have not departed therein from the Faith of Primitive Antiquity, as it hath been preſented in the preceding part of this Chapter; but clearly teach and aſſert with them a poſſibility of the Saints declining even unto death.

I neither have leaſure, nor opportunity of Books, to make any full Collection from their Writings, of ſuch paſſages, which, by the number of thoſe ſayings that I have obſerved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, within a very ſmall compaſs of reading, I preſume are to be found therein; but ſhall give a brief account unto the Reader, of what I have met with of this import, and obſerved, by ſome occaſional inſpections into their Writings, now and then. I begin with the Standard-Bearer Himſelf of this Brigade, Mr <hi>Calvin.

But leſt under a pretence of that</hi> GRACE, which THEY HAD OBTAINED, <hi>they ſhould indulge a carnal</hi> ſecurity, <hi>He tells them they have need of Perſeverance. For many, having onely taſted lightly of the Goſpel, do not ſo much as think of any proficiency, as if they were come to the higheſt pitch already.

The Readers patience (I ſuppoſe) would hardly bear a particular recitation of all the paſſages and ſayings, which with a little ſearch might be drawn together out of the Writings of this one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who is generally looked upon as the main Pillar of the Common Doctrine of Perſeverance, which yet ſtrike at the very face of it.

From whence I would infer, not ſo much the uncertainty or inſtability of Judgment in ſo worthy a man, as the ſignal uſefulneſs, or neceſſity of ſuch a Principle, or Poſition in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> without the help and interpoſure whereof, thoſe that are ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies unto it, know not how to manage many their <hi>Christian</hi> occaſions, or affairs, otherwiſe.

At preſent, I ſhall add onely one Teſtimony more from <hi>Calvin,</hi> wherein he doth not onely, or ſimply, aſſert a poſſibility both of the total, and final, falling away of true Beleevers, but even a frequent reduction into act of ſuch a poſſibility.

It being moſt equal, that what we deſire ſhould be done unto our ſelves, we alſo ſhould do unto others: or if we ſhall deny, or refuſe to do this, that we ſhould be deprived of that Favor, which we deny unto others. In this caſe then it may come to paſs, and juſtly happeneth, that Grace once received ſhould be made vain, or frustrate. But this is not to be imputed to any instability of the Divine Clemency, which in God hath no place, but unto our wickedneſs.

            <p>The ſame Author elſewhere, doth not onely declare His Judgment ſimply and poſitively for the Doctrine aſſerted by us, but with a plain intimation alſo of his diſſent herein from others. <hi>Some diſpute</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whether it may not ſo come to paſs, that ſuch a ſin, which was venial, may not by circumſtances, become mortal, as in caſe Drunkenneſs ſhould be much frequented, and become customary, and Anger by being long retained, become ſtrengthened. My ſence is, that even here alſo the quality of the Offender ought to be conſidered. But if He, who was made Partaker of the Divine Grace</hi> [or Favor] <hi>ſhall</hi> FALL FROM THIS GRACE, AND, OF A PERSON JVST, <hi>Religious, Faithful, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God,</hi> SHALL BECOME UNIVST, <hi>impious, unbeleeving, and a contemner
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:94900:214"/> of God, as this mans Conſcience by loſing the</hi> purity <hi>of</hi> Faith, <hi>becomes liable unto</hi> death, <hi>ſo likewiſe all thoſe Sins of His, which, whileſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was in Grace, were venial, are now turned into mortal. Thus we read,</hi> Ezek. 18. When the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall forſake his righteouſneſs, and ſhall commit iniquities, He ſhall dye in them. <hi>And again,</hi> all his righteouſneſs ſhall not be remembred. <hi>Now what elſe can follow, but that if a good</hi> tree <hi>be corrupted, the</hi> fruits, <hi>which were good, muſt become evil? They, who from the Principles</hi> [or, beginnings] <hi>of</hi> Faith, <hi>and of the</hi> good Spirit, <hi>degenerate into perfidiouſneſs</hi> [or Unbelief] <hi>render the whole courſe of their lives, which was</hi> partaker <hi>of Grace, culpable of</hi> death. <hi>Such as theſe, are they, who, with the</hi> Galatians, <hi>begin indeed in the</hi> ſpirit, <hi>but end in the</hi> fleſh. <hi>They are liable unto</hi> condemnation, <hi>and their Sins are no longer venial, but mortal, unleſs they repent, and return to the Grace of the Blood of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>from which they are fallen; if yet they be fallen upon no worſe</hi> terms, <hi>then that they are in a</hi> capacity <hi>of returning unto Grace.

But becauſe others have prevented me in both, as, <hi>viz.</hi> the forementioned <hi>Gerard. Joh. Voſsius</hi> in the former <note n="c" place="margin">Hiſt. Pelag. l. 6.

            <p>Onely for a taſte, I ſhall here preſent the Reader with a few lines out of the Confeſſion of the Reformed Churches of <hi>Saxony,</hi> wherein they profeſſedly give the right Hand of fellowſhip to us in the Doctrine held forth in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Digreſſion. <hi>When it is ſaid</hi> (ſaith this <hi>Confeſſion</hi>) that <hi>ſins remain in the regenerate, it is neceſſary that a difference he made. For from that ſaying,</hi> Luk. 11. He goes and takes unto Him ſeven other ſpirits worſe then Himſelf, and they entering in dwell there, &amp;c. <hi>and ſuch like ſayings, it is manifeſt, that ſome</hi> REGENERATE PERSONS <hi>grieve and ſhake</hi> [or daſh] <hi>the Holy Spirit out of them,</hi> ARE AGAIN CAST OFF BY GOD, AND BECOME GVILTY OF THE WRATH OF GOD, AND OF ETERNAL PVNISHMENT. <hi>And</hi> Ezek. 18. <hi>it is written: When a righteous man ſhall forſake His righteouſneſs, and ſhall commit iniquity, He ſhall dye therein. And when the unrighteous ſhall forſake His unrighteouſneſs, and do righteouſneſs, He ſhall live therein. Therefore there is a neceſsity of putting a difference between ſuch ſins, which remain in holy men during this mortal life, but do not expel</hi> [or drive] <hi>the Holy Ghoſt out of them, from ſuch other ſins, for which a man becomes</hi> AGAIN LIABLE TO THE WRATH OF GOD, <hi>and to Eternal Puniſhment. And</hi> PAVL <hi>Rom. 5. diſtinguiſheth between ſin reigning, and not reigning. And elſewhere He ſaith: If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye: but if by the Spirit ye ſhall mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, ye ſhall live</hi>

            <p>From the Premiſſes (exhibited in this Chapter) theſe five things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludable above all contradiction. Firſt, That the Doctrine of abſolute and unconditioned Perſeverance, as it is commonly taught, and beleeved, amongſt Profeſſors at this day, and as it is ſtated and maintained in the Writings of many Reformed Divines, over-honored (many of them) with the ſtile of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi> was not known, or heard of by the Name of <hi>Orthodox,</hi> in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:94900:216"/> and purer Times of Chriſtian Religion; nor owned, or taught by any of the learned Fathers, or Writers, for ſeveral Centuries of years after <hi>Christ.</hi> Secondly, That neither ſince the Reformation of Religion by <hi>Luther,</hi> and his Compeers, hath it found entertainment with the generality (at leaſt) of that numerous party of Proteſtants, which, for diſtinction ſake, are termed <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> or with the learned amongſt them, but that theſe (very few, if any, excepted) generally teach, and beleeve, with the Primitive Chriſtians and Fathers, that perſons truly regenerate and beleeving, may poſsibly fall from their preſent ſtanding, and that ſo, as never to riſe again. Thirdly, That this Doctrine (I mean, the poſſibility of ſuch a declining in true Beleevers, which ends in death and condemnation) is by ſome, who otherwiſe are generally looked upon as followers of <hi>Calvin,</hi> yea and are (not undeſervedly) number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt the moſt judicious and learned of this party, pregnantly, and with particularity of profeſſion and acknowledgment, avouched. Fourthly, That <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, who is ſuppoſed to be the firſt Founder, or Father, of the ſaid common Doctrine of Perſeverance, or however, is the Grand Patron and Protector of it, together with the generality of his learned followers, are conſtrained ever and anon in their Writings, to give Teſtimony unto, and to aſſert the contrary, whether it be by the forcible evidence of the Truth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing at times over them, or whether it be out of a neceſſity that ever and anon recur'd upon them, to uſe the Principle of the contrary Doctrine, for the due managing and carrying on other ſubjects and diſcourſes. Fifthly and laſtly, That the Doctrine of falling away, maintained in the Digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yet in hand, hath been held, maintained, and profeſſed, not onely by particular perſons, both ancient, and modern, of greateſt name and note for true worth in every kinde, as for ſanctity, learning, largeneſs of parts, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judgment, &amp;c. but by Councils, Synods, and whole Proteſtant Churches alſo in their Confeſsions. All which conſidered, we ſhall need no other demonſtration of the importune unreaſonableneſs and vanity of thoſe ecſtatical and wilde <hi>encomiums,</hi> or exorbitant depredications of the Doctrine of inevitable and unfruſtrable Perſeverance, which are found in the writings, and heard from the mouths, of ſome of the over-zealous Admirers of it, as if (for example) it were <hi>the fundamental Article of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; One of the principal Points of Chriſtian Religion, wherein the Proteſtant Churches are purged from Popiſh Errors,</hi> and which hath always been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Reformed Churches againſt Papiſts; <hi>the Foundation of all true certainty of Salvation, without which that fiducial and firm Aſſurance, which is requiſite in, and unto, true Beleeving, cannot ſtand;</hi> Such <hi>a Doctrine, which all true Miniſters of the Goſpel ought to inculcate into, and whet upon, all true Beleevers for their Comfort,</hi> with other like <hi>ſwelling words of vanity.</hi> Doubtleſs if it be an Error, and confederate againſt the Holineſs and Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, (a Crime, which hath been by many competent and ſufficient witneſſes proved againſt it) it is ſo far from meriting any of thoſe impotent acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lately ſpecified, that it really deſerves to have its portion with thoſe Merchants and Money-changers, whom our Saviour with a ſcourge drave out of the Temple <note n="a" place="margin">John 2. 15.</note>, as Profaners of the Holy Deſign and Counſel of God therein.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Learning and Authority of the late <hi>Synod of Dort</hi> is layd<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> hold on by many, as Shield and Buckler to defend the ſaid Doctrine, I ſhall, for a cloſe of this Chapter, and of the whole Digreſsion, briefly account unto the Reader for ſuch particulars, as I judg worthy his cognizance and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:94900:217"/> ſervation, in, and about what this <hi>Synod</hi> attempted, in order to the defence, maintenance, and ſafety of the ſaid Doctrine. Far be it from me to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Report, or information of thoſe, who charge the reſpective Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this <hi>Synod</hi> with ſuffering themſelves to be bound with an Oath, at, or before their admiſſion hereunto, to vote down the Remonſtrants and their Doctrines (how ſoever,) yet when I read and conſider, 1. How learnedly, ſolidly, and ſubſtantially they quit themſelves and argue, whileſt they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the Remonſtrants, and declare wherein they agree with them, in the Points controverted between them; 2. How feebly and unlike them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they reaſon, when they come to the quick of the difference; 3. (And laſtly) how neer at very many turns, even in thoſe things, wherein they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to differ, they come unto them, as if they had a very good minde to be no more two, but one with them; When (I ſay) I conſider all theſe things, methinks I ſee the Intereſt and Obligation of an Oath working much after the ſame manner, as ſometimes it did in <hi>Herod,</hi> when <hi>for His Oath's ſake,</hi> contrary to his minde and deſire otherwiſe, He cauſed <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptists</hi> Head to be given unto <hi>Herodias</hi> in a Platter <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 14. 9.</note>. To ſhew how pregnant (or, if you will, how maſculine) they are, in avouching their Judgments, whileſt they keep company with their Adverſaries, is (I conceive) needleſs, as well themſelves (I mean ſuch of them as are yet living) as their friends, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſible enough hereof, without Argument or Proof. To ſhew how far they fall beneath themſelves, when they come to conteſt, and plead the Points in difference, would be (in effect, and in reference to the buſineſs in hand) but to re-do that, which is done already. In which reſpect neither is this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. I ſhall therefore, with as much brevity, as the Reader can well deſire, and in a regular proſecution of the deſign of the Chapter in hand, onely ſhew how neer they came, in ſence and ſubſtance of matter, to their Adverſaries, in the preſent Queſtion concerning Perſeverance; and leave it to Chriſtian Conſideration, whether the difference between the two combating Parties was of that latitude, or weight, that the one ſhould deſerve the beautiful Crown of Orthodoxiſm and Honor, for their diſſent from their Adverſaries; and the other, the puniſhment, ſhame, and reproach of perſons ſo deeply and deſperately erroneous, for their non-agreement with theirs.</p>
            <p>This Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> expreſly granteth, that not onely they who are under<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> a poſſibility of falling away, both totally and finally, but who <hi>de facto,</hi> will thus fall away, (for their <hi>Non-Electi</hi> ſignifie ſuch men as theſe] <hi>may be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally enlightened, by vertue whereof they may underſtand, that thoſe things, which are reported</hi> [or layd down] <hi>in the Word of God, are true, and do give an</hi> UNFEIGNED ASSENT <hi>unto them</hi>

               <note n="d" place="margin">

               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:94900:217"/>. By the expreſs Tenor of all this diſcourſe, moſt
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:94900:217"/> evident it is, that this Synod granteth a poſſibility of falling away, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and finally, in thoſe (at leaſt in many of them) who by means of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural illumination, and this wrought by the Holy Ghoſt, come truly and unfeignedly to beleeve the Goſpel, yea and to live and to walk conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably unto it. So then if it be made to appear by clear evidence of Scripture, that ſuch as theſe, (<hi>viz.</hi> who truly and unfeignedly beleeve the Goſpel, live conformably to it, &amp;c.) are true and ſound Beleevers, in an eſtate of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, acceptation with God, &amp;c. it undenyably follows, that this <hi>Synod,</hi> which with the weight of their ſentence ground to powder their Brethren termed Remonſtrants, for their Opinions, as being of moſt dangerous and deſperate conſequence, (eſpecially this, concerning the poſsibility of a non-perſeverance in true Beleevers) were in the very ſame condemnation them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; held and aſſerted the ſame Errors (if yet Errors they were) with them. I ſpeak now only concerning their dogmatizing with them in the Point of Perſeverance (the fifth and laſt Head of the Controverſies between them.) But the truth is, and an intelligent Reader may readily finde it, that in other Points alſo, wherein they ſentenced the perſons mentioned, as men ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and dangerouſly erroneous, as in the queſtion about the extent of <hi>Christs</hi> Death, the extent of ſaving Grace, &amp;c. they deliver and maintain the ſame things with the perſons ſentenced by them, if not formally in plainneſs and expreſſneſs of terms (though ſometimes they want very little even of this) yet arguitively, in grounds and principles, manifeſtly bearing, and iſſuing forth the ſame concluſions; as we ſhall have occaſion to ſhew (God willing) in the progreſs of our preſent Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Or though it could not be proved from the Scriptures, that the perſons ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to a poſſibility of a total and final Apoſtacy, by the <hi>Synod,</hi> are true and real Beleevers, yet if they were, or be, ſuch, in the ſence and judgment of the Remonſtrants (which is apparant enough that they were, and are) the Synod had no cauſe to fall foul upon them, as erroneouſly diſſenting from them in the Point of Perſeverance, but onely as diſſenters, or erroneous, in judging, or diſcerning the difference between ſound, and unſound Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, or between Perſons juſtified, and not juſtified. But this onely by the way.</p>

Yea, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes, not onely the collection, or joynt concurrence of the particulars ſpecified, a diſtinguiſhing character of true and ſound Beleevers from thoſe who are not ſuch, but ſome of them even ſingly and apart from others. As, 1. A true and unfeigned Belief of, or Aſſent unto, the things revealed by God in the Goſpel. <hi>But theſe things are written, that ye might beleeve that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that beleeving ye might have life through His Name</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 20. 31.</note>. Firſt, there is nothing more evident, then that the Word of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:94900:218"/> God doth report, and declare, That <hi>Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi> 2. It is here plainly aſſerted, that to believe this (at leaſt with a true and unfeigned Faith, or Belief) is available unto <hi>Life,</hi> or Salvation. Otherwiſe we muſt ſay, that that Faith, for the effecting and working whereof in the hearts of men, the Goſpel was written, is unavailable to ſave them. Which to affirm, what is it but to bring an evil and hard Report upon the gracious Counſel and Intendment of God, in cauſing the Goſpel to be <hi>written?</hi> But the ſame truth is moſt manifeſtly aſſerted in very many places beſides. <hi>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 5.</note>? To <hi>overcome the world,</hi> is an unqueſtionable character of a perſon juſtified, and in favour with God. And <hi>whoſoever</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God,</hi> partakes in this glory, is victorious <hi>over the world.</hi> So again, the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> having a little before his Aſcention, commiſſioned his Apoſtles thus; <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel unto every creature;</hi> He immediately ſubjoyneth, <hi>He that believeth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved: but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mark 16. 15 16.</note>. That <hi>believing,</hi> which our Saviour here requires, and unto which he promiſeth <hi>Salvation,</hi> is (doubtleſs) no other Faith, or believing, but a true and unfeigned belief of that Goſpel of his, which his Apoſtles (in the words immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding) were injoyned to <hi>preach unto the world.</hi> And if it ſhall be ſaid, That men might, or may, <hi>believe,</hi> and that truly and unfeignedly, all that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preach to them, and yet periſh; that vaſt and ſignal difference which our Savior here makes between <hi>Believing,</hi> and <hi>not believing,</hi> vaniſheth into nothing, is made none at all. See further upon the ſame account, <hi>Joh. 8. 24. &amp; 11. 27. Acts</hi> 8. 37, with 38. <hi>Rom. 4. 3. &amp;</hi> 10. 9. with very many other Texts of like pregnant and unqueſtionable import. From all which it fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that a true and unfeigned admiſſion, or Reception of the Goſpel, as it cometh from God, and is declared by him in the Writings of the Prophets, Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles, into the heart, and Soul of a man, (which is done by a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>unfeigned</hi> belief of, or conſent unto, it,) tranſlates him from death to life, makes him a Child of Light, a Son of God, an Heir of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.

And beſides, the whole Tenor of the Diſcourſe there managed makes this manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Fearing leaſt I have over-charged the Readers patience already, I ſuperſede the citation of the ancient Fathers (beſides others more of our later Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Authors) who (generally) look upon it, as no injury to Truth, to hold and teach, that a true, real, and unfeigned aſſent unto the Goſpel, and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Salvation, herein, is nothing leſs then a true juſtifying, and ſaving Faith, a Faith enſtating a perſon in the Grace and Favor of God. So that by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Teſtimony, 1.

Therefore thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, O man, whoſoever thou art, that judgeſt: for wherein thou judgeſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, thou condemneſt thy ſelf: for thou that judgeſt, doſt the ſame things.</hi> Yea it hath been proved, that this Synod it ſelf flew an higher pitch of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Perſeverance of the Saints, then thoſe, who upon this account were made ſuch grant offenders by them.</p>
            <p>This Indictment we have hitherto managed, and made good againſt them<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> by the conſideration of one character or expreſsion onely from their own pen, whereby they deſcribe thoſe, whom they expoſe to a poſsibility of apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing to perdition, <hi>viz.</hi> a true and unfeigned belief of, or conſent unto, the Evangelical Compact, and whatſoever is revealed by God in the Goſpel.

            <p>Leaving therefore the <hi>Synod</hi> at preſent, let us recollect and draw up into<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> a brief account, the ſum of all that hath been argued in the preſent digreſſion, and ſo conclude this Chapter.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It hath been clearly proved, that the Doctrine which maintains an abſolute neceſſity, or infallibility of the Saints Perſeverance in Grace, or Faith, unto the end, hath nothing more in it (or rather, nothing ſo much) for the true and real conſolation of the Saints, then that which is contrary unto it. Secondly, Diligent and unpartial ſearch hath been made into thoſe paſſages of Scripture, which the greateſt Advocates of the ſaid Doctrine of Perſeverance mainly inſiſt upon, for the defence of it: none of which, it hath been made fully to appear, holdeth any true or real correſpondency with it. Thirdly, The beſt and moſt ſubſtantial Arguments and Grounds, upon which the ſaid Doctrine is wont, by the skilfulleſt workmen of Her Party, to be built, have been weighed in the balance, and found too light. Fourthly, The Doctrine contrary hereunto, and which avoucheth the poſsibility of
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:94900:220"/> the Saints declining, and this unto death, hath been aſſerted by the expreſs Teſtimony and conſent of many Scriptures. Fifthly, This Doctrine alſo hath received further credit and confirmation from ſeveral Principles and grounds, as well of Reaſon, as Religion, and theſe pregnant and ſtrong. Sixthly, The truth of this latter Doctrine hath been further aſcertained by ſeveral inſtances and examples of perſons, who by their <hi>fallings,</hi> have cauſed the ſaid Doctrine to <hi>ſtand</hi> impregnable. Seventhly, This Doctrine hath been countenanced alſo by the concurrent ſence of all Orthodox and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly</hi>-learned Antiquity. Eightly, It hath likewiſe received Teſtimony from the generality of that Learning and Religion, ſince the times of Reformation, which have commended themſelves unto the World in the Works and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of that Party of men in the Proteſtant Churches, which is commonly known by the Name of <hi>Lutheran.</hi> Ninethly, Subſtantial proof hath been made, that the profeſſed Adverſaries of the Doctrine we now ſpeak of, even the moſt ſteady, grave, and beſt adviſed of them, have at unawares, given large and clear Teſtimony unto it, being not able, without the help of the ſpirit which ſpeaketh in it, to manage (like themſelves) their diſcurſive affairs in other caſes. Yea, Tenthly (and laſtly) that the <hi>Synod of Dort</hi> it ſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening with a conſcientious, if not with a concupiſcentious prejudice alſo (for this is the ſtrong ſuſpicion of many) againſt it (with its fellows) and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and provoking one another, to lay the honor of it in the duſt for ever, hath at ſeveral turns, and in divers expreſſions, according to the interpretation and ſence of their own moſt orthodox and learned Friends, yea and ſome of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, fully comported with it, aſſerting that in clearneſs and evidence of Principle, which they deny with ſolemnity of proteſt, and with a Religious abhorrency, in concluſion.</p>
            <p>We now return to the further proſecution of the buſineſs principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this Diſcourſe, (from which we have made ſomewhat a large di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, upon the occaſion formerly ſpecified,) and to compleat our Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this great and moſt important Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ever-bleſſed Son of God, and Saviour of the World, the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> gave Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Ranſom in His Death for all, and every man, without exception of any.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving in our late Digreſſion largely vindicated ſome material proofs<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> from the Scripture, formerly levyed for the defence of that Great and moſt important cauſe, both of God, and men, the Univerſality of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Christ,</hi> we now proceed to a further levy upon the ſame account, and ſhall raiſe up more Scriptures to plead the ſame cauſe.</p>
            <p>Let us begin with the Parable of the marriage-feaſt, as it is reported by <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi> We ſhall not need (I ſuppoſe) to tranſcribe the whole <hi>Protaſis</hi> of the Parable, which is very large: but onely inſiſt upon ſome few known paſſages of it, ſuch as I conceive will joyntly, if not ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:94900:221"/> give a light of demonſtration to the Truth of that Doctrine, the proof and confirmation whereof is the prize contended for in this Diſcourſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if the Reader deſires an entire enter-view of the Parable, He may repair<note place="margin">Matt. 22. 2, 3, &amp;c. Luk. 14. 16, 17, &amp;c.</note> without much trouble, to the Evangeliſts themſelves.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Expoſitors generally agree, that by thoſe who were the firſt, and ſecond time called or invited, to the wedding [<hi>He ſent forth His ſervants to call them, that had been called</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>, <hi>to the wedding: Mat.</hi> 22. 3.] are typified, or meant, the <hi>Jews;</hi> whom God had anciently invited, and called, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of His Prophets, and ſeveral other ways, to partake of that great Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, which He intended to confer upon the ſons and daughters of men, by means of His onely begotten Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and who were the ſecond, yea and the third time alſo, invited hereunto; firſt by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf, and afterwards by His Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Tenor or form of the invitation, which the ſervants ſent forth to call thoſe, that had been formerly invited, were injoyned by the King to uſe in calling them, is this: <hi>Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my Oxen and my Fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: Come unto the marriage</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 22. 4</note>. When he ſaith to thoſe that are invited, <hi>I have prepared my dinner, my oxen, &amp;c.</hi> doubtleſs His meaning is not, that He had <hi>prepared His dinner</hi> for others, or that His <hi>Oxen and Fatlings were killed</hi> for the entertainment of others, and not for thoſe who were invited by Him. Such an intendment as this in His invitation, had been meerly deluſory, and altogether unmeet to repreſent the intentions of God in calling men to communion and fellowſhip with His Son <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> by His Miniſters of the Goſpel. He that ſhould invite a man to a feaſt, and uſe ſuch an Argument or motive as this, to perſwade Him to accept of this His invitation, and to come accordingly, <hi>viz.</hi> that He had made very liberal preparations for ſuch and ſuch other men, but had provided nothing for Him, ſhould He not render Himſelf ridiculous by ſuch a ſtrain of Oratory?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Evident it is, that very many of thoſe, who were invited to this Marriage-feaſt by the King, and conſequently, for whom the feaſt was <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,</hi> and for whoſe ſake <hi>the Oxen and Fatlings were killed,</hi> never came to partake of the ſaid Feaſt, but were rejected, and excluded from it with great indignation, by Him that had ſo graciouſly invited them. <hi>But when the King heard thereof, (viz.</hi> how they had miſ-uſed, and murthered His Servants) <hi>He was wroth, and ſent forth His Armies, and deſtroyed thoſe Murtherers, and burnt up their City</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Verſe 7:</note>. Concerning whom likewiſe, the King ſaid to His Servants, that had been ſent forth to invite them: <hi>I ſay unto you, that none of thoſe men that were bidden,</hi> [and refuſed to come,] <hi>ſhall taſte of my Supper</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 14. 24</note>.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is no leſs evident, that the true ground or reaſon why thoſe, that were thus excluded from the Feaſt, or ſuffered this excluſion, was not any precedent purpoſe or intendment in the King to exclude them, (for had any ſuch intention harbored in Him, queſtionleſs He would never have invited them,) no nor yet that ſubſequent intendment in Him, to exclude them, when He ſaw their great unworthineſs; but this unworthineſs of theirs it ſelf. <hi>Then ſaith He to His Servants, the wedding is ready; but they which were bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, were</hi> NOT WORTHY. <hi>Go ye therefore into the high ways</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 22. 8.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Clearly implying, that it was the UNVVORTHINESS of the perſons invited, which was the true and proper cauſe of their excluſion. Neither the import, nor ſentence of the Law, nor yet the Judg, or His juſt ſeverity in giving ſentence according to the Law, are ſo properly the cauſe of the puniſhment, or death,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:94900:221"/> of the Malefactor, as the crime committed againſt the Law by himſelf. It is meerly accidental to the Law, and to the Judg, and ſo to their intentions (reſpectively) that ſuch, or ſuch a perſon, becomes a Malefactor, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that he ſuffers death. But the ſuffering puniſhment, or death, are the natural and proper fruits of the violation of the Law, juſtly inflicting them, in whomſoever it be found. And if the matters of Fact deſerve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or death, it would argue a defect in the Law, and in the Judg, if they ſhould not, according to their different capacities, give ſentence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. We have (as I remember) elſewhere ſhewed, that neither God, nor any Decree, or Law of his, are any cauſe, intentionally, or directly, of any mans, either ſin, or puniſhment, but occaſionally, or accidentally only: and that ſo, that whoſoever ſinneth, or comes to be puniſhed for ſin, might have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided both, any Purpoſe, Law, or Decree of God notwithſtanding. And to this purpoſe, pertinent is the Obſervation made by <hi>Muſculus,</hi> upon our Saviours expreſſion, <hi>Mat. 22. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Fifthly (and laſtly,) The pregnant Reſult of the premiſed Particulars, is this, That the <hi>marriage Feaſt</hi> in the Parable, was provided by the King, and the <hi>Oxen and Fatlings,</hi> here ſpoken of, <hi>killed,</hi> not only for thoſe, who upon their invitation, were perſwaded to come and partake of them, but as well, and with equal (if not with more eſpecial) intentions on the Kings part, for thoſe alſo, who never came to taſte of them; and conſequently, that the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſignified by the <hi>Oxen and Fatlings</hi> ſlain) and the bleſſedneſs accruing unto the children of men hereby, ſignified by the Feaſt it ſelf, were equally meant, and intended by God, for thoſe who periſh, and for thoſe who are ſaved; and conſequently, for all men, without exception of any. And indeed this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Parable lieth ſo large and full in the carriage of it, that <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf could not but ſubſcribe unto it, as he that ſhall pleaſe to peruſe his Commentaries upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 2. and withall acknowledg what is evident, muſt needs confeſs.

In theſe paſſages, this Great ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Enemy to the Univerſality of Redemption by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> clearly ſuppoſeth (or affirmeth rather) the ſame to be a truth. For he expreſly affirmeth, that God <hi>provided a Table of Entertainment, for thoſe, who rejected it, and never came unto it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and ſuppoſeth, that the <hi>Supper provided</hi> [by God] <hi>for us,</hi> may, through our neglect of our invitation hereunto, be withheld from us, and that others may be admitted unto it in our ſtead. If the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> and Salvation by him, were provided and prepared by God, as well for thoſe who reject them, as for thoſe who imbrace them, doubtleſs they were intended for all men without exception. Which truth (as was lately obſerved) is ſo neceſſary for the due managing of the Scriptures, and many other the moſt important affairs in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, that the Profeſſed Enemies thereof are ever and anon conſtrained and forced to make uſe of it, both in opening the Scriptures, as likewiſe in their other Theological Diſcuſſions and Debates, and ſo conſequently, to give teſtimony unto it. And the very truth is, that it is one of the main Pillars, that ſupports and bears up the weighty Fabrick of that Divinity and Religion, which the Scriptures hold forth unto the World.</p>
            <p>Another piece of Scripture riſing up in aſſertion of the ſame Doctrine, is<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> that which ſpeaks in theſe words; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> (word for word,) <hi>For there hath appeared the Grace of God, which is ſaving unto all men</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Tit. 2. 11.</note>, [or, <hi>being ſaving unto all men,</hi>] that is, which is of a ſaving nature, property, or tendency, unto all men. The <hi>Syriac</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation reads, <hi>Servatrix omnium,</hi> the ſavioreſs of all men. Our laſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlators, rendering the place thus, <hi>For the Grace of God, which bringeth Salvation, hath appeared unto all men,</hi> ſhew themſelves more indulgent to their own ſence and opinion, then will well ſtand with the ingenuity and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs required in Tranſlators, (an infirmity too too apparant in them at ſeveral other turns,) though the truth is, that this Tranſlation of the words damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies their Opinion one way, as much, or more, then it gratifies it in another. For in making the Apoſtle to ſay, that the <hi>ſaving Grace of God hath appeared unto all men,</hi> they ſuppoſe him to be of their Judgment, who conceive the Goſpel, and the <hi>ſaving Grace</hi> thereof, to be diſcovered and preached by God unto men, not only by the Miniſtry of Men, or by the Letter of the Goſpel it ſelf, but by the Works of Creation alſo, and the gracious Government of the World. For certain it is, that the <hi>ſaving Grace</hi> of God, of which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks, had not at this time <hi>appeared unto all men,</hi> upon any other terms. But this by the way. Our former Tranſlators dealt much more fairly with the Holy Ghoſt at this place, rendering and pointing the words thus: <hi>For that Grace of God, that bringeth Salvation unto all men, hath appeared. The Grace of God [in Chriſt</hi>] is here ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſalvifical unto all men, not becauſe it is ſuch to all ſorts, or ranks of men only, or, to ſome men of all ſorts and degrees, (as ſome, not fearing to deſtroy the clear ſence of the Holy Ghoſt, to ſalve their own, interpret,) but becauſe it is ſuch to <hi>all men</hi> ſimply, and without exception of any. This Expoſition is confirmed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Context, in the words immediately following, wherein the proper end, or ducture, of this <hi>ſaving Grace of God</hi> now diſcovered, is declared, thus: <hi>Teaching us that denying all ungodlineſs and worldly lusts, we ſhould live
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:94900:222"/> ſoberly, righteouſly and godlily in this preſent world.</hi> If then this <hi>ſaving Grace of God, teacheth, i. e.</hi> be apt to <hi>teach,</hi> perſwade, and lead <hi>all men,</hi> without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well one, as another, to a <hi>denyal of all ungodlineſs—and to live ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>—then muſt it needs be alike <hi>ſaving</hi> unto all. For if this teaching pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in it, flows from the <hi>ſavingneſs</hi> of it, (which the Apoſtle here clearly ſuppoſeth,) then muſt the <hi>ſavingneſs</hi> of it neceſſarily be of equal extent with that property. An Act of Grace, Love, or Bounty, inviteth, obligeth no more unto thankfulneſs, then thoſe to whom it is meant and intended. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that the <hi>ſaving Grace</hi> of God, held forth, and profered unto <hi>all men</hi> in the Goſpel, <hi>teacheth,</hi> inviteth, perſwadeth, obligeth <hi>all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the goodneſs and the love of God towards man. I here demand, How, or whether, God can in any tolerable conſtruction of Reaſon, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence, be ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a lover of men, or to bear an affection of love to men, in caſe he ſhould hate incomparably the far greateſt part of men, and that with the hatred of a Reprobation from eternity, leaving them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all poſſibility of eſcaping eternal miſery and torment, and this, when as at the ſame coſt and charge, which he hath been at for the ſaving of a few, he might have provided for the Salvation of them all. For this they affirm, who grant, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed ſufficiently for all, but intentionally only for a few. Can we ſay that a King, or Prince, is a Lover of his Kingdom, or of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, only becauſe he loves two or three Favorites about his Court, eſpecially when the generality and great Body of his Subjects, are in imminent danger of periſhing, or being undone, unleſs he provides for their relief, &amp; he in the midſt of the greateſt abundance of means to relieve them, and this without the leaſt prejudice, or hinderance to himſelf, ſhall altogether neglect them in their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and miſery? Doubtleſs there was never Prince or King ſince the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, that ever obtained the Name, or Honor, of <hi>a Lover of his Subjects,</hi> upon ſuch terms as theſe. And yet they make God a <hi>Lover of men,</hi> in no other ſence, upon no whit better terms, who affirm and teach, that he loved only that ſmall number of men, which they call, <hi>His Elect,</hi> (which the Scripture very frequently affirms to be <hi>few,</hi> in compariſon of thoſe who periſh,) when as that great generality, and vaſt Body of men, were from the greateſt to the leaſt of them, in moſt imminent danger of being undone (and that in the moſt dreadful manner that can be imagined) to the days of eternity; teaching withall, that the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> which was beſtowed upon theſe few only, was ſufficient for the ſaving of the reſt alſo; and that God upon meer will and pleaſure, not to eaſe his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the leaſt, nor to accommodate himſelf at all otherwiſe, implacably reſolved from eternity to exclude all theſe from part and fellowſhip in that Salvation. With a great deſire my Soul deſireth, that men, whoſe conſciences ſerve them to oppoſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Controverſie, would ſeriouſly and calmly confider, whether that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that love to mankind, which the Scripture reporteth to be in God, be at all compoſſible, or conſiſtent, with ſuch a diſmal deſign in reference unto men, as that now repreſented.</p>
            <pb n="409" facs="tcp:94900:223"/>
            <p>Again, If God loveth only ſuch a ſmall number of men, as the Opinion, which we oppoſe, ſuppoſeth, why is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the love of Angels, as well as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the love of Men, aſcribed unto him? For doubtleſs if God loves no more men, then thoſe, who come to be actually ſaved, he might more properly and truly be ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Lover of Angels, rather then a Lover of Men. Becauſe if we ſhall reſtrain his love towards men, only to thoſe comparative few, who will be actually and eventually ſaved, he will be found to love a far greater proportion of Angels, then of men: it being no ways probable, but that the number of Angels, who keep their ſtanding, and are Elect, is far greater, being compared with thoſe that fell, then the number of men, who according to the Scriptures are like to be actually ſaved, is, being compared with thoſe that periſh.</p>
            <p>To ſay, that Gods Love, though but to a few men, expreſſed in the gift of<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to dye for them, is more conſiderable, and ſo a more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ground of giving the denomination of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> unto him, then the love which he bears to Angels, though more in number, or in proportion, is to ſay that, which no way eaſeth the matter, or ſalveth the difficulty. Firſt, Becauſe the Angels, the <hi>Elect Angels</hi> (as the Scripture calleth them) are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with men in the gift of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> given unto men, though not in that Redemption from ſin &amp; miſery, which accrues unto men by him (unleſs haply it be by ſympathy with their fellow creatures, in their joy and bleſſedneſs) yet otherwiſe, as appears from <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10. and other places: and beſides is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged by Divines. Secondly, One of the higheſt expreſſions I remember, whereby the happineſs procured for men by the gift of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſet forth in the Scripture, is but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an equality with the Angels, or likeneſs of condition with them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 36. Therefore Gods Love to the Angels that ſtand, doth not fall ſhort, at leaſt to any ſuch conſiderable degree, of the Love which he beareth unto men, that are ſaved. Therefore the Reaſon why he is ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Lover of Men, not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a Lover of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, is not becauſe he loves ſome men more then he doth any Angels: but becauſe he loved all men, and not all Angels.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if God ſhould love only ſuch a ſmall parcel of men as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, with the hatred of all the reſt, he might much more properly be termed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Hater of men, then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Lover of men. Whereas the Scripture frequently extols and magnifies the Love of God towards all men, yea towards his Enemies, <hi>on whom he maketh his Sun to ariſe,</hi> and <hi>ſendeth rain,</hi> as well as on his Friends <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5 45.</note>, and ſtrictly injoyneth all thoſe that would be accounted his children, to reſemble and imitate him in this his goodneſs: but no where ſuggeſteth the leaſt degree of any hatred in him againſt any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of man, perſonally conſidered, nor any other, then what doth <hi>redundare in perſonam,</hi> (as the School-men ſpeak,) <hi>i. e.</hi> which redoundeth, and (as it were) runs over, from the ſin, which he hateth, unto the perſon, in whom that ſin is found.</p>
            <p>Again, if God ſhould not love the generality of mankind in order to their Salvation by <hi>Christ,</hi> then all the good which he doth unto them in outward things, as in <hi>making his Son to ariſe, and his Rain to fall</hi> upon them, (as our Saviour ſaith he doth, as well upon <hi>the unjuſt, as the just,</hi>) and ſo his <hi>filling of their heart with food and gladneſs,</hi> with the like, muſt be conceived to be done by him upon ſuch terms, and with ſuch intentions, as men uſe to lay ſcraps for birds, or bait hooks for fiſhes; which they do for none other end, but to take and <hi>deſtroy</hi> them. For if God hath no intent in theſe Diſpenſations of his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:94900:224"/> them to do them any good in a ſaving way; he muſt needs be conceived to intend their ruine and deſtruction, at leaſt the increaſe of their ruine and deſtruction, by them: it being no ways reaſonable to conceive, but that he hath higher and more conſiderable ends propounded to himſelf in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Adminiſtrations about men, in reference unto men, then about beaſts, in relation unto them: though it is true, he hath the ſame general and ultimate End, his Glory, in all his Works and Adminiſtrations, one or other. But if the generality, or far greateſt part of men, are bound to beleeve (and bound they are to beleeve it, if it be a revealed Truth) that God, in giving them health, and peace, and proſperity in the world, intends nothing but evil to them, a fuller cup of the wrath and vengeance which is to come, how can the <hi>bountifulneſs and long-ſufferance of God be ſaid to lead men to Repentance?</hi> which yet is the Apoſtles Doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. Neither the goodneſs, nor patience of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evil men, can be ſaid to <hi>lead them to Repentance,</hi> but by the mediation, or ſuppoſal, of theſe three Principles. 1. That theſe Diſpenſations of God (I mean, of <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>patience</hi>) towards ſuch men, are proper and ſufficient [I mean by the help of that operation of the Spirit of God, which always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth them] to bring men <hi>to Repentance.</hi> And 2. That Gods intent is, that they ſhould bring them actually <hi>to Repentance;</hi> or at leaſt, that he hath no intention otherwiſe, or to the contrary. 3. (And laſtly) That he truly and really intends their Salvation, upon their <hi>Repentance.</hi> Wicked men can at no hand of reaſon, no nor yet of common ſence, be ſaid to be <hi>led to Repentance,</hi> by the <hi>goodneſs</hi> or <hi>long-ſufferance</hi> of God towards them, unleſs 1. It be ſuppoſed, that there is a genuine, natural, or proper Rhetorique, or moving tendency in them to perſwade and encourage ſuch men to <hi>Repent;</hi> nothing can be ſaid to <hi>lead</hi> a man, to ſuch or ſuch an action, or courſe, but that which is proper to invite, or perſwade him unto either. Nor unleſs it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, 2. That God hath an intent, that ſuch men ſhould be actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and made willing to <hi>repent</hi> by ſuch Diſpenſations, at leaſt that he ſhould have no intentions to the contrary. For how can any man be actually perſwaded or made willing by any means, motive, or encouragement what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to attempt, or do, any ſuch thing, which he hath cauſe to judg, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that Gods intentions ſtand againſt his doing, or performance? There is no motive or encouragement, againſt the determinate Counſel of God made known. Nor 3. (and laſtly) Can the ſaid Diſpenſations of <hi>goodneſs</hi> or <hi>patience</hi> in God, be ſaid to <hi>lead</hi> any man <hi>to Repentance,</hi> unleſs it be yet further ſuppoſed, that his real intent and purpoſe is to ſave him, upon his <hi>Repentance,</hi> or in caſe he ſhall <hi>Repent,</hi> or at leaſt, that they may be ſuch. For what encouragement can any man have to <hi>repent,</hi> in caſe he hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to judg, that God hath abſolutely rejected him, and will not ſave him, no not upon his <hi>Repentance?</hi> Therefore certainly God hath no intentions of evil, or of condemnation, or of encreaſe of condemnation, againſt the generality of men, no nor yet againſt the worſt or wickedeſt of men, in thoſe gracious vouchſafements of life, health, liberty, peace, food, rayment, and other the like temporal mercies and accommodations unto them.</p>
            <p>Again, How can men look upon themſelves as any ways debtors, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> unto God in thankfulneſs, for good things adminiſtred unto them with hard intentions, or with a purpoſe not to bleſs them, but to make their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſo much the greater, and more heavy upon them? If birds and fiſhes had underſtanding, and ſhould know for what end, or with what intentions, men
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:94900:224"/> lay ſcraps and baits, though made of ſuch things as they love, and ſtand in need of, in their way, would they thank them for it, or ſhould they have any reaſon ſo to do? Or had <hi>Amaſa</hi> any cauſe to think the better of <hi>Joab</hi> for <hi>taking Him by the Beard with His right Hand, to kiſs Him</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 20. 9</note>? Or our Saviour, to think the better of <hi>Judas,</hi> for the <hi>kiſs</hi> wherewith He greeted Him <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 26. 49</note>?</p>
            <p>Beſides, it being the duty of the Saints to imitate or reſemble their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, not onely in His outward Expreſſions, but much more in His Intentions, and frame of ſpirit towards men, when He doth good unto them, cauſing <hi>His Sun to ariſe, and His Rain to fall upon them,</hi> in caſe His Intentions towards them in ſuch applications of Himſelf unto them, were bent, not upon their Salvation, but Deſtruction, would it not follow, that when they ſhould perform thoſe <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſervices unto them, injoyned by our Saviour Himſelf, <hi>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5. 44.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were bound to do all theſe in order unto, and with an intent to procure, their greater and deeper condemnation, and not with any intent to gain them in to the Goſpel? And if wicked men, enemies to the Saints, ſhould know, or have reaſonable ground to judg, that when they expreſs themſelves outwardly in terms of love, and good-will, towards them, they mean them ruine, or increaſe of Puniſhment and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereby, had they not cauſe to judg them the vileſt Hypocrites and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers under Heaven? Nor do they repreſent the glorious <hi>God</hi> Himſelf any whit better, unto the World, who affirm and teach, that in, and under, His moſt pathetical, and moving invitations, encouragements, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory offers of Grace, Mercy, Salvation, unto the generality of men, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Scriptures are full,) He intends not the Donation, or gift of Grace, Mercy, or Salvation unto them, upon any condition or terms whatſoever, but Wrath, and Judgment, and an opportunity to render them ſeven-fold more the children of death and condemnation, then otherwiſe they would, or could, have been.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If God intends the increaſe of guilt and puniſhment unto wicked men, or the generality of men, in the comforts and good things of this world providentially diſpoſed and diſpenſed unto them, He muſt needs deſire the bringing or coming of theſe accordingly upon them. No man intends any thing in order to the accompliſhment of ſuch, or ſuch, an end, but this end is deſired by Him. Again, certain it is that the increaſe of guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot come upon men, by means, or by occaſion, of the good things given by God unto them, but onely by the intervening of their unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and abuſe of theſe good things, in one kinde, or other. Further, as there is no man but wiſheth, and deſireth the coming to paſs of ſuch things, which are ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary for the bringing to paſs ſuch things as He deſireth, ſo hath no man cauſe to be offended with any man for the doing of ſuch things, which are ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary to the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any ſuch end, which He deſireth; eſpecially when His deſire in this kinde is raiſed and built upon foundations of Righteouſneſs and ſound Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which is not queſtionable in, or about, any the deſires of God. Now then if God intends, He muſt needs alſo deſire, the increaſe of guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon wicked men, or the generality of men; if He deſires this, He hath no cauſe to be offended with theſe men, for their unthankfulneſs, or for any ſuch abuſe of His Mercies or good things conferred upon them, without which it was unpoſſible for Him to attain His deſired end, <hi>viz.</hi> an increaſe
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:94900:225"/> of guilt and condemnation upon them, (as was aſſerted.) The Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (according to our late<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aſſerted principle) no man hath cauſe to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with another, for doing that, which is directly and abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the bringing to paſs of any ſuch end, which is maturely, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſound Principles of Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, projected and deſired by Him. Nor is there the leaſt queſtion to be made, but that, if God intends, and conſequently deſires, the increaſe of guilt and condemnation upon the generality of men, both His Intentions and Deſires in this kinde, are moſt regular, in reſpect of all regularity, that either Wiſdom, or Righteouſneſs, can give unto them.</p>
            <p>Not will it much, if any thing at all, here help, to ſay, that though God<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> doth not intend the Salvation of the generality of men in giving unto them the good things of this life to enjoy ſo abundantly, as for the moſt part he doth, but the increaſe of their guilt &amp; condemnation, yet in as much as no particular man knoweth but that God may intend His ſpiritual good, and Salvation, in ſuch Diſpenſations, all a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I anſwer: No man ſtands bound to beleeve that, or to conceive Hope of that, which He hath no ſufficient ground of bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eving, or why He ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it: much leſs to beleeve that, which He hath much more Reaſon to queſtion, or doubt of, then to beleeve. <hi>Solomon</hi> informeth us, that it is the property of <hi>a fool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to beleeve every thing</hi> [or, every word <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 14. 15.</note>,] <hi>viz.</hi> as well that, which He hath no ground or reaſon to beleeve, as that which He hath. And it is commonly ſaid and taught amongſt us, that in matters of Religion, and of Salvation, nothing ought to be beleeved by any man, but what He hath a ſufficient ground, in, or from, the Word of God, to beleeve. If ſo, if no man ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to beleeve, in matters appertaining to Salvation, but what He hath a ground, or warrant in the Word of God to beleeve; much leſs ought He to beleeve any ſuch thing, the truth whereof the Word of God admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters much more ground to doubt, queſtion, and ſuſpect, then to beleeve. So that if this be a Truth revealed in the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of God, That God doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſpiritual good of the generality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of far the greateſt part of men, in their outward mercies and good things, but the contrary; certain it is that every particular man (at leaſt, that hath no ſufficient proof of His Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) hath ten, twenty, if not an hundred times more reaſon to doubt and queſtion, whether His ſpiritual good be intended by God, or no, in the things we ſpeak of, then to beleeve that it is intended. As in the buſineſs of a lottery, where there are fourty, it may be an hundred blanks for one prize, no man hath ſo much reaſon or ground to hope, that He ſhall draw a prize, in caſe He ſhould adventure his money this way, as that He ſhall draw a blank. And upon this account, lotteries have ſtill been accounted little better then cheats, or unworthy devices contrived gin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wiſe, to catch the money of ſimple and inconſiderate people, men of underſtanding eaſily diſcerning the fraud, and ſo keeping their foot out of the ſnare. And whether that Doctrine, which teacheth, that God intendeth onely the Salvation of a few, but the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many, and yet commandeth all to beleeve that they may be ſaved, doth
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:94900:225"/> not make the glorious Goſpel of God like unto one of ſuch lotteries, I leave to all underſtanding and unprejudiced men to conſider.</p>
            <p>In the mean time evident it is, that this Opinion, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed not for all men, but for ſome few onely, is (as it were) calculated, and the face of it bent and ſet, to make the diſtance between Heaven and Earth, between God, and His creature, Man, greater and wider, then yet it is; to multiply jealouſies and hard thoughts in the hearts and mindes of men and women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, where they are more then apt enough to engender and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, without the irritation of ſuch a Doctrine. Yea whereas God hath put Himſelf into His <hi>Chriſt (God was in Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, as we heard formerly <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 5. ſect. 28.</note>, <hi>reconciling the World unto Himſelf,</hi>) that by the means of Him, and by the Tender and Promiſe of <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of ſins unto men, through Him, upon the gracious terms of beleeving, He might prevail with the World to love Him, to think well and honorably of Him; this Doctrine ſeeks to put Him out of His <hi>Chriſt</hi> again, at leaſt in reference to any ſuch glorious deſign as that of <hi>reconciling the World</hi> unto Him: yea and ſaith (in effect) unto the World it ſelf, Beleeve Him not, though He ſpeaketh never ſo graciouſly unto you: when He promiſeth you Life and Salvation upon the faireſt and freeſt terms, He hath War in His Heart againſt you, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to deſtroy you.</p>
            <p>If it be yet objected, that upon the ſame ground, no particular Perſon<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> ſhould have any ſufficient ground, or Reaſon, to beleeve, that He is one of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, in as much as the number of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, is affirmed to be but ſmall; I anſwer,</p>
            <p>True it is, no man is bound to beleeve ſimply and abſolutely, that He is one of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved; but conditionally onely, <hi>viz.</hi> in caſe He ſhall beleeve, and perſevere beleeving unto the end. All that a man is bound to beleeve in this kinde poſitively, is, that He is one of thoſe that may be ſaved: and the Doctrine aſſerted by us, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all men without exception, adminiſtreth a fair ground, and full footing for ſuch a Faith, as this, unto every man. Whereas the Doctrine oppoſite hereunto, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that <hi>Christ</hi> dyed for the Elect onely, leaveth no foundation or ground at all of this Faith, unto any man whatſoever, at leaſt being yet in His Natural condition, and unconverted. For, 1. if onely thoſe men be in a poſſibility of being ſaved, for whom <hi>Christ</hi> dyed: And, 2. if <hi>Christ</hi> dyed for the Elect onely; And, 3. if no unregenerate or unconverted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hath any ground to beleeve that He is one of Gods Elect; It roundly follows, and with pregnancy of conſequence, that no ſuch Perſon [I mean, who is yet unconverted] hath any ſufficient ground to beleeve that He Is one of thoſe, that may be, or that is in a poſſibility of being, ſaved. All the ſaid <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> or Premiſſes, [as, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That no man is in a poſſibility of being ſaved, but onely thoſe for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed. 2. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed onely for the Elect: And, 3. that no unregenerate Perſon hath any ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to beleeve, that He Is one of the Elect;] are authentique and unqueſtionable, according to the known Principles of our Adverſaries: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the concluſion ſpecified muſt be admitted, and owned, by them. If they will admit the ſaid concluſion, and judg it no ways prejudicial, either to themſelves, or their cauſe, ſo to do; I would demand of them, what founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of encouragement they can lay, to perſwade unregenerate men, either to <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> to <hi>labor for the me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> that endureth to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> or to apply them ſelves ſeriouſly and effectually, in one kinde or
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:94900:226"/> other, to the means of beleeving. We know that without Hope, or an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended poſſibility of obtaining, what is endevored and ſought after, all motives or grounds of perſwaſion unto action, amount to no more, then to the beating of the Ayr: the Hearts of men are not at all taken, or wrought, by them. Deſpair of Salvation, quencheth all thoughts, all endevors, all deſires of beleeving. Therefore if an unregenerate Perſon hath no ſufficient ground of Hope that He is one of thoſe, who are ſo much as in a poſſibility of being ſaved, He is not capable of any impreſſions from any ground or motive whatſoever to beleeving.</p>
            <p>If it be here ſaid; though an unregenerate Perſon hath no ſufficient ground<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> of Hope that He Is one of Gods Elect, and conſequently, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for Him, yet He hath ſufficient ground of Hope that He MAY BE one of theſe, and ſo, that there is a poſſibility that <hi>Chriſt</hi> MAY have dyed for Him: and upon the account of ſuch an Hope as this, He hath encouragement ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to apply Himſelf to the means of beleeving; I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſuch an Hope, which amounts onely, or very little more then, to a bare apprehended poſſibility of obtaining, hath but a very feeble and faint influence upon the Heart of a conſidering man, by way of encouragement unto action, eſpecially unto ſuch action, which is of a laborious and difficult import, and wherein He muſt deny Himſelf, in matters of eaſe, pleaſure, profit, &amp;c. and this to an eminent degree. Now it is generally known, that that action, or courſe of engagement, wherein they muſt labor and exerciſe themſelves, who deſire to beleeve unto Salvation, is of ſuch an import as we ſpeak of: it is a courſe of action, wherein men muſt put forth, or give out themſelves, <hi>with all their Heart, and with all their Soul, with all their minde, and with all their ſtrength,</hi> wherein they muſt labor, ſtrive, watch and pray continually, deny themſelves, crucifie the old man, &amp;c. or otherwiſe, not expect Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither is it ſo clear a Truth (eſpecially according to the Principles of thoſe againſt whom we now argue) that an unregenerate man hath a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground of Hope, that He may be one of the Elect. For if He be not at preſent one of theſe, there is no poſſibility (according to the ſaid Principles) that ever He ſhould be ſuch. If it be replyed; that the meaning of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, a regenerate man hath a ſufficient ground of Hope that He may be one of the Elect, is not, that He may be one of theſe, <hi>hereafter,</hi> whether He be one of them at preſent, or no; but, that He may be one of them, <hi>at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;</hi> I anſwer, that Hope, in propriety of import, reſpecteth not what is, or may be, at preſent, but what may be, or is like to be, in the future. Nor do I remember any inſtance throughout the Scriptures, where they make, or ſuppoſe, any other object of Hope, but onely that which is, or may be, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: nor that any definition of Hope given by learned Divines, aſſigneth any other. So that it is very improper (at leaſt) to ſay, that an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man hath ground of Hope that He may be at preſent, one of Gods Elect. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (A little to indulge impropriety of terms) I demand, whether the Scriptures do not conſtantly repreſent and make unregeneracy, or an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving condition, eſpecially joyned with an habitual practice of known ſins, a ground of fear, that a man is not at preſent one of the Elect of God; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether they do not make ſuch a condition a ground of certain knowledg, that a man is not at preſent, one of the Elect of God? According to the Principles of the adverſe Party in the Queſtion in hand, all the Elect ſhall
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:94900:226"/> certainly be ſaved, and inherit the Kingdom of God: but the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly teach and affirm, That unbeleevers and unregenerate men, eſpecially living in known ſins, <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> as we have in the two next preceding Chapters ſhewed at large. Therefore unleſs we ſhall ſay, that the Scriptures are divided in themſelves, it is unpoſſible to ſhew or prove, that they any where exhibit or afford any ground of hope to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate and unbeleeving perſons, as we now ſpeak of, that they may be <hi>at preſent</hi> the Elect of God. The Scripture no where excludes the Elect of God from Salvation, but every where aſſerts them as Heirs hereof. Therefore thoſe whom it excludes from part and fellowſhip in this buſineſs, are not, at leaſt in Scripture ſence (nor indeed in any ſence conſiſtent with Reaſon) the Elect of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If ſuch unregenerate perſons as we ſpeak of, have any ſufficient ground to hope, that they MAY be, <hi>at preſent,</hi> the Elect of God, then have they the like ground of hope, that they ARE at preſent, of this number, and the Elect of God. The Reaſon of this ſequel is plain: becauſe what a man is, and what he may be at preſent, are one and the ſame; it being unpoſſible that he ſhould be at preſent any thing beſides, or any other, then what he is at preſent, no ſubject whatſoever being capable of any otherneſs, or alteration, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; according to that known Maxim in natural Philoſophy, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tus non fit in inſtanti,</hi> No motion can be in an inſtant of time; as alſo that other, <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid est, quando eſt, neceſſe est eſſe;</hi> i. e. <hi>Whatſoever is, whilest it is, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity be</hi> [that which it is.] Therefore he that hath ground to hope that he MAY BE one of Gods Elect at preſent, hath ground, yea the ſame ground, to hope that he Is ſuch an one at preſent. Now if ſuch an unregenerate man, as hath been oft mentioned, hath a ſufficient ground of hope, that he is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, one of Gods Elect, then have the generality of wicked and unregenerate men (reſpectively) a ſufficient ground of hope, that they are all, and every perſon of them, the Elect of God. For if any one of this ſort of perſons hath a ſufficient ground of hope in this kind, then have they all, and every one, the ſame: for no ground of difference between them in this caſe, is imaginable. But how ill it accords with ſundry the grounds and principles of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, to affirm, That all the world, which (as <hi>John</hi> ſaith) lieth in wickedneſs, ſhould have ſufficient ground of hope that they are the Elect of God, I leave to themſelves to conſider. Therefore certainly no unregenerate perſon (ſuch eſpecially as we lately deſcribed) hath any ſufficient ground of hope that he is at preſent one of the Elect of God; and conſequently, the Doctrine we oppoſe for denying that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all men without exception, leaveth no place or ground of any ſuch hope unto unregenerate perſons, which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to engage or provoke them unto any Goſpel enquiry, or addreſſment of themſelves to the means of beleeving; no nor yet which leaves them in any capacity of being wrought or perſwaded hereunto, by any other motives or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="5">5. (And laſtly) In caſe unregenerate men, ſhould, by the leave and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſaid Doctrine, be under any ſuch hope, as it aſſerts unto them, [I mean, that they may be the Elect of God, in that ſence of the word, <hi>Elect,</hi> which the Patrons of this Doctrine commonly put upon it,] yet would not this hope be apt or likely to animate or encourage them to ſuch applications of themſelves, as thoſe ſpecified, no nor yet ſuffer them to be much affected with, or wrought upon, in this kind, by any other motives or means of excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatſoever. The Reaſon hereof hath been formerly given, where we
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:94900:227"/> ſhewed, and proved, that ſuch an hope, which hath certainty of ſucceſs, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, abſolutely and unconditionally inſured unto it, is not of that kind of hope, which is likely to engage much unto action <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 10. Sec. 15. &amp; Cap. 13. Sect. 7.</note>: I here add, and have added, That the very <hi>genius</hi> or import of it, is rather to render the Subject of it uningageable unto action by other motives. And thus we clearly ſee, by a through examination and debate of the whole buſineſs, that the Doctrine of our preſent conteſt, and which denyeth that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all men, leaveth no ground of hope for any perſon whatſoever in his natural condition, that he either is, or may be one of thoſe, who are in any poſſibility of being ſaved by Chriſt: and conſequently, muſt needs be a Doctrine Anti-evangelical in the higheſt. This for the opening and aſſerting of the Philanthropy of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle writeth thus to the <hi>Hebrews, For if we ſin willingly after</hi>

               <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 10. 26.</note>, he clearly ſuppoſeth, that they, for whoſe <hi>ſins</hi> there was an expiatory <hi>Sacrifice</hi> offered by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may by Apoſtacy, and a rejection of the grace of this Sacrifice, reduce themſelves to ſuch a condition, wherein they ſhall be uncapable of any attonement for ſin by any <hi>Sacrifice</hi> whatſoever. For this clauſe, <hi>there remaineth</hi> NO MORE <hi>Sacrifice for ſin,</hi> evidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, 1. That before the horrid ſin of Apoſtacy, here ſpoken of, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that fall into it, have, or had, a <hi>Sacrifice for</hi> their <hi>ſins, [viz.</hi> for the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and attonement of them,] which can be no other, but the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the Death of <hi>Christ.</hi> In ſaying, <hi>there remaineth no more,</hi> [or, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, not ſtill, or, not further] <hi>a Sacrifice for ſins,</hi> he muſt of neceſſity ſuppoſe, that till that ſad alteration in their ſpiritual eſtate here deſcribed by <hi>their ſinning wilfully after, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould befall them, they were partakers of a <hi>Sacrifice for</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of their <hi>ſins,</hi> which (as hath been ſaid) muſt needs be the Death of <hi>Christ;</hi> otherwiſe they ſhould have been in no worſe caſe, as to matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving benefit by the Death, or Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after their Apoſtacy, then before. 2. That upon, and after this alteration, they are, either abſolutely and altogether excluded from a re-admiſſion into their former grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were partakers of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> or at leaſt that they ſtand upon terms of extream difficulty ever to obtain ſuch a re-admiſſion. So that this paſſage of Scripture, befriendeth both the main Doctrines avouched in this firſt part of our Diſcourſe, with pregnancy of confirmation, reſpectively. For, 1. It ſuppoſeth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Himſelf for the <hi>ſins</hi> of thoſe, who very poſſibly may never be ſaved by him, and conſequently, for all men without exception, (for concerning thoſe, that come to be ſaved by him, there is no queſtion.) And 2. That they who have ſometimes been partakers of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and hereby of the Grace and Favour of God in the pardon of their ſins, may afterwards apoſtatize into ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein <hi>there remains no more Sacrifice for their ſins, but a certain look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for of judgment and fiery indignation, &amp;c. Calvin</hi> himſelf knew not (it ſeems) how to manage the place, but in full comport with the ſence given. <hi>There is a great difference</hi> (ſaith he, upon the place) <hi>between particular fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſuch an Univerſal defection, whereby it cometh to paſs that we</hi> WHOLY FALL AVVAY <hi>from the Grace of Chriſt. But becauſe this cannot befall any man, but him, who is enlightened, therefore he ſaith, If we ſin willingly after we have received the knowledg of the Truth: as if he ſhould ſay, who ſhall willingly</hi> CAST AVVAY THAT GRACE, WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED. A little after: <hi>He</hi> [the Apoſtle] <hi>denies that any Sacrifice remains for thoſe, who</hi> DEPART
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:94900:227"/> FROM THE DEATH OF CHRIST: <hi>which is not done by any particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency, but by a</hi> CASTING AVVAY OF FAITH TOTALLY <note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>We ſhall, upon the account of this Chapter, produce only one brief paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> of Scripture more; wherein the Gracious Intentions of God towards all men, in point of Salvation by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are like <hi>Solomons King upon his Throne, againſt whom there is no riſing up.</hi> The intire Verſe, wherein the words we mind, are ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note n="c" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note>. Evident it is, (and Expoſitors generally conſent,) that the Apoſtle in theſe words, propounds a further Reaſon or conſideration, to ſatisfie thoſe, that being weak, were apt to ſtumble, and take offence, that the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> delayed his coming to judg the World, and to deliver his Saints, ſo long. No man (ſaith the Apoſtle in effect, upon this account) hath any reaſon to be offended, or take it amiſs at the hand of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he makes no more haſte in coming to judg the World, ſeeing that his delay in this kind proceeds not at all from any neglect, or backwardneſs in him, to perform his Promiſe in that behalf, (though ſome men count all delay, which is contrary to their minds, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, to be no better, then neglect, or ſlackneſs unto action,) but from his great patience, and long-ſufferance towards men; His will and deſire being, that no perſon whatſoever of mankind, either in preſent being in the world, or that ſhall be born hereafter, ſhould periſh everlaſtingly, but that every man of them ſhould come to Repentance, whereunto his <hi>patience and long-ſufferance</hi> inviteth, yea and <hi>leadeth them</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note>, and by which many are actually led and brought unto it, that ſo they may be ſaved. From the paſſage thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, I argue thus: If <hi>Chriſt</hi> be not willing, that any man ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance, then queſtionleſs he intendeth the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all, and conſequently dyed intentionally for all: [for unleſs he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to dye for them, yea and did dye for them, it is not poſſible that he ſhould either will or intend their Salvation, in as much as no man can will, or intend, that which he knows to be unpoſſible.] But certain it is, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not willing that any man ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance, the Holy Ghoſt in the Scripture in hand expreſly affirming it. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt the ſence and Interpretation of the words given, and ſo to the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditating<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> of the Argument built thereon, it is pretended by ſome, that the

To give colour to this Expoſition, they circumſcribe the particle, or pronoune, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. I would demand of this Expoſitor, and of thoſe who ſence with him in the Interpretation ſpecified, why, or by what authority, they expound, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>towards us</hi> [the Elect,] rather then, <hi>towards us</hi> [Beleevers.] For if they will needs have the perſons here ſpoken unto, to be conſidered by the Apoſtle, not in their Natures, or general capacities, <hi>viz.</hi> as they were men, but in ſome particular or ſpecial capacity, wherein other men, or all men, did not partake with them, the capacity of Saintſhip, or of Faith, was as neer at hand, as that of Election. For that the perſons we ſpeak of were Saints and Beleevers, is far leſs queſtionable, then that they were Elect, in their ſence of the word, Election, who thus interpret. It is true what <hi>Estius</hi> alledgeth to credit his Expoſition, that this Epiſtle was written to the ſame perſons with the former, who are ſtiled, <hi>Elect, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 2. But 1. Whether his <hi>Elect,</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>Elect,</hi> be the ſame, is very queſtionable; unleſs (haply) the Apoſtle puts it out of queſtion that they are not the ſame, by ſetting forth his <hi>Elect</hi> (in the place cited) by ſuch a deſcription, which will not agree with <hi>Eſtius</hi> his <hi>Elect: Eſtius</hi> (with the Generality of Divines amongſt us) by his <hi>Elect,</hi> underſtands as well thoſe, that ſhall repent and beleeve hereafter, though they be at preſent <hi>ſons of Belial,</hi> and <hi>to every good work Reprobate,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,) as thoſe, who actually do beleeve; whereas <hi>Peter</hi> (in the place now mentioned) eſtimateth his ELECT by <hi>the Sanctification [i. e.</hi> the actual Sanctification] <hi>of the Spirit unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus Christ, according to the fore-knowledg</hi> [or pre-approbation] <hi>of God, [i. e.</hi> as God approved and judged it meet, and conſequently decreed, from eternity, to regulate his <hi>Election</hi> of men, in time.] But this only by the way: for as to this Scripture, with others which treat of Election, we ſhall (God favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) ſpeak more fully in due time. 2. Though the Epiſtle was (as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor alledgeth) written to the ſame perſons with the former, who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſaid former Epiſtle, are termed, <hi>Elect;</hi> yet are theſe perſons, in this very Epiſtle, and much neerer to the place in hand, deſcribed, or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in their capacity of <hi>Beleeving. Simon Peter an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, to them that have obtained like precious</hi> FAITH <hi>with us</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that in this reſpect, there is much more reaſon, why in the place in queſtion, he ſhould ſpeak unto them, or conſider them, as <hi>Beleevers</hi> (with Himſelf) then, as <hi>Elect</hi> with Himſelf, in ſuch a notion of <hi>Election,</hi> wherein <hi>Elect</hi> are diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Beleevers,</hi> as was lately declared. But now to make the Apoſtle to ſay,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:94900:228"/> that <hi>God is patient towards us</hi> [BELEEVERS,] <hi>not willing that any of us</hi> [who BELEEVE] <hi>ſhould periſh, but that all</hi> [WE] <hi>ſhould come to Repentance,</hi> is to make him ſpeak beneath the line of common ſence. For, 1. the <hi>Patience</hi> of God towards <hi>Beleevers,</hi> who are in a preſent capacity of Salvation, and (according to the Principles of our Adverſaries) out of all Poſſibility of <hi>periſhing,</hi> is no means of their non-periſhing; neither need He be <hi>patient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> them in reference to any ſuch end. 2. Neither have theſe need to <hi>come to Repentance,</hi> in order to their <hi>non-periſhing,</hi> unleſs we ſhall ſuppoſe them in a Poſsibility of a total loſs of that Faith, that is in them, yea and that they will <hi>defacto</hi> totally loſe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Apoſtle doth not, in the place in hand, ſpeak of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to whom He writes, as they were <hi>Elect</hi> (in the common ſence of the word) appears from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe, in caſe there were any <hi>Elect</hi> in this ſence, the <hi>Patience</hi> of God towards them, would be no argument or ſign of His <hi>non-willing</hi> their <hi>periſhing,</hi> or of His <hi>willing</hi> that they ſhould <hi>come to Repentance:</hi> becauſe He ſhews the ſame, or greater, <hi>Patience</hi> towards ſuch Perſons, who are not <hi>Elect</hi> (in that ſence) and who never come to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, or <hi>Repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lord is not here ſaid to be, <hi>not willing that any</hi> [of the Elect] <hi>ſhould periſh,</hi> or, <hi>but that all</hi> [theſe] <hi>ſhould come to Repentance,</hi> but ſimply and indefinitely, <hi>that any ſhould periſh,</hi>

Now concerning the place in debate, certain it is, that the capacity, or conſideration, of <hi>Election,</hi> is, not onely not at all men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned or ſpecified in the ſame period, nor yet in the ſame Paſſage or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or any where neer at hand, but not ſo much as in all the Epiſtle from firſt to laſt.

               </gap>, <hi>all,</hi> do not here ſignifie any of the <hi>Elect,</hi> and, all the <hi>Elect,</hi> but any men, and, all men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Neither can God, in any tolerable conſtruction or propriety of ſpeech, or ſence, be ſaid to be patient, or <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> towards thoſe, whom He loves with the greateſt love that is, and this unchangeable, (for ſuch is the love of <hi>Election</hi> ſuppoſed by thoſe, againſt whom we argue, to be,) eſpecially if it be ſuppoſed withall (which theſe men ſuppoſe likewiſe) that though they be wicked, yet they cannot Repent, cannot ceaſe to be wicked, until God comes with a ſtrong and irreſiſtible Hand to cauſe them to Repent. For when we ardently and affectionately love a Perſon, one, or more, we cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be ſaid to be patient towards them, though we do not puniſh them for ſuch miſcarriages, or actions, wherein they are prejudicial unto us, in caſe we know it to have been impoſſible for them to forbear ſuch actions, unleſs we our ſelves had effectually reſtrained them from them. It would not argue any patience in a Parent towards His young Infant, which He tenderly loves, to forbear correcting it, in caſe it ſhould let fall, and break a Venice glaſs, or
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:94900:229"/> ſome like brittle commodity, which were put into the hand of it. <hi>Patience</hi> (we know) is a Grace, or Vertue, whereby a man is enabled, and diſpoſed, to moderate the Natural Paſſion of Anger, and to prevent the exorbitant and undue motions of it. So that <hi>Patience</hi> hath no place, or opportunity, to expreſs it ſelf, but onely in ſuch caſes, wherein this Paſſion is apt to be ſtir'd, and provoked. Now the Paſſion we ſpeak of, Anger, is not apt to be raiſed or provoked, but onely by ſuch actions, wherein, or whereby we apprehend, either our ſelves, or ſome neerly relating to us, to be neglected or deſpiſed, according to the Philoſophers diſcourſe and deſcription of it, wherein He mentions <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the neglect, or contempt of a Perſon, or of ſome related to Him, as always the cauſe of it <note n="a" place="margin">

               </note>: which deſcription, if need were, we might ſhew to be very agreeable to what the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves deliver concerning the ſame Paſſion. So then, in caſe there be no ground, or reaſon, upon which God can judg himſelf, or any of his, neglected, or deſpiſed, by the impenitency of his <hi>Elect</hi> in their ſinful ways, whileſt they continue in them, He cannot be ſaid to be patient, or <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> towards them, though he forbears to puniſh them with death for it.

Neither can the <hi>Elect</hi> (in ſuch a ſence, as many call Elect) truly, or reaſonably, <hi>account the long-ſuffering of the Lord Salvation</hi> unto them (which yet the Perſons here ſpoken of, and to, are in the ſequel of this Chapter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to do:) [<hi>And account that the long-ſuffering of the Lord is Salvation,</hi> Verſ. 15.] For they that have Salvation, infallibly, and infruſtrably, againſt, and above, <hi>Death, Life, Angels, Principalities, Powers, things preſent, things to come, height, depth, every creature</hi> whatſoever, aſcertained, aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or deſigned, by the irrevocable Decree of God unto them, ſtand in no need of any reſpite, or reprievement from death through the <hi>long-ſufferance</hi> of God, in order to the obtainment of <hi>Salvation.</hi> Becauſe in caſe they ſhould dye, either the firſt moment that they are born into the world, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter never ſo much ſin committed, yet the Decree of God concerning their Salvation, being peremptory, abſolute, and irreſiſtible, muſt needs take place, and produce their <hi>Salvation,</hi> againſt all obſtructions, and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whatſoever. Therefore as a man hath no reaſon to ſet any ſuch high prize upon a Receipt preſcribed unto him by a Phyſician, in order to his health, as to call it <hi>His</hi> LIFE, or the emphatical means of his preſervation, in caſe his life would certainly have been preſerved without it: So neither have the <hi>Elect</hi> any competent reaſon or ground, to call, or <hi>count the long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord</hi> towards them, SALVATION, [<hi>i. e.</hi> a ſignal means, or oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, of <hi>Salvation</hi> to them,] in caſe this their <hi>Salvation,</hi> might, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſhould, have been obtained by them, or conferred on them, whether any ſuch <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> had been vouchſafed unto them, or no. If it be ſaid, That as the Salvation of the Saints is infallibly decreed, ſo is it with the like infallibility decreed to be effected by the <hi>long-ſufferance</hi> of God towards them, as the means and opportunity thereof, and in this reſpect, they may properly enough be required to <hi>count,</hi> or eſteem, the <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> of God towards them, <hi>Salvation:</hi> I anſwer; If the Decree of God concerning the Salvation of the Saints, be abſolute and infallible, (in the ſence aſſerted, and
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:94900:229"/> contended for by our Oppoſers,) then cannot the execution of this Decree, the actual ſaving of the Saints, be ſuſpended upon any fallible or contingent condition, ſuch as is the Saints <hi>accounting the long-ſufferance of God</hi> to be <hi>Salvation</hi> to them, or their managing this <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> of his in due order to their <hi>Salvation;</hi> no more then the ſtanding or continuance of an houſe, that is well and ſtrongly built upon a rock, depends upon thoſe weak or rotten ſhores or props, which are applyed unto it to ſupport it. Nor can God be ſaid abſolutely and infallibly to decree the coming to paſs of ſuch things, which are eſſentially, in themſelves, and in their own Natures, contingent, it being a Maxim generally granted by our Adverſaries themſelves, That the Decrees of God have no real influence upon their objects, or things decreed, at leaſt no ſuch, which altereth their Natures, or eſſential properties of their Beings. It is a common ſaying amongſt them, that <hi>Praedeſtinatio nihil ponit in praedeſtinato, i. e.</hi> Predeſtination putteth nothing in, or into, either the thing, or perſon, predeſtinated. And if Predeſtination putteth nothing in, or into, the things or perſons predeſtinated, there is no reaſon to judg that any other of his Decrees doth any whit more. And if the Decrees of God relating unto contingent events, ſhould have any ſuch influx upon them, which alters their Natures, and changeth the fundamental Laws of their Beings, transforming them into things abſolutely neceſſary, or neceſſary with any ſuch neceſſity, which is unavoydable, contingency would be onely a name, or matter of meer ſpeculation, God having with the ſame infallibility and abſoluteneſs of Decree (as ſay our Adverſaries) decreed things contingent, and things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and conſequently made all things, as to matter of event and coming to paſs, neceſſary. So that the <hi>Salvation</hi> of the Saints is not abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by God to be effected by His <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> towards them: Nor could this <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> be reaſonably by them accounted <hi>Salvation,</hi> in caſe their <hi>Salvation</hi> were ſo abſolutely decreed unto them, as our contrary-minded Brethren ſuppoſe. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="6">6. (And laſtly) when the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the Lord is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all &amp;c.</hi> his meaning muſt needs be, that he is <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> towards men, ſimply and indefinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, or, towards mankinde; and that this <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> of his towards them, proceeds out of a gracious and merciful diſpoſition in him, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth him, <hi>not</hi> to <hi>will,</hi> or deſire, the deſtruction of any Perſon, or Soul, of them, but that they may generally, one and other, by the advantage and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of his goodneſs and <hi>long-ſufferance</hi> towards them, be ſo overcome, as to <hi>repent</hi> unfeignedly of their ſins, and turn unto him, that they may be ſaved. This Interpretation,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Perfectly accords with the words, in their genuine, proper, and beſt-known<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> ſignifications: whereas the other (as we lately proved) requires ſuch a ſence and ſignification, of the two Particles, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. The ſeries and ſtory of the Context, falls in much more genuinely and fairly with this, then with that other, interpretation; the ſcope of the words, being (as we formerly likewiſe ſhewed) to vindicate the delay, which the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> maketh, in not performing His Promiſe of coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſo much celerity and expedition, as ſome conceive it meet that He ſhould perform it, from any Pretence, or Plea, that can in a way of Reaſon, render it offenſive unto any man.

            <p n="3">3. The ſence of the words and place, which this <hi>Interpretation</hi> exhibiteth, is more clearly parallel, and conſiſtent with the minde of the Holy Ghoſt in other <hi>Scriptures,</hi> then that which is iſſued by the other. The <hi>Scripture</hi> no where, at leaſt no where ſo much, commendeth the <hi>Patience</hi> or <hi>long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance</hi> of God determinately towards his <hi>Elect,</hi> or towards Beleevers, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their <hi>Repentance</hi> or <hi>Salvation,</hi> as towards the generality of men, and more eſpecially towards thoſe that are wicked and ungodly. <hi>But we are ſure</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) that the Judgment of God is according to Truth, againſt them which commit ſuch things.

Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth</hi> THEE <hi>to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. But</hi> THOV <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 2. 2, 3, 4.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And God Himſelf by His Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaketh thus to the wicked and ſtiff-necked Jews in general: <hi>Turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſsions: ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine.</hi> And further: <hi>For why will ye dye, O Houſe of Iſrael.

               <note n="b" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 30, 32.</note>. And elſewhere by the ſame Prophet: <hi>Say unto them, As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his ways and live.

               <note n="c" place="margin">Ezek. 33. 11</note>? Our Apoſtle himſelf, ſpeaking of the wicked generation of the old world, and of Gods Patience towards them, ſaith thus: <hi>Which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were diſobedient, when once the long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of Noah</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 20</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not to multiply Places, that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (formerly opened <note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 6.

               <note n="f" place="margin">1 Tim. 2 4.</note>. In all theſe Paſſages (unto which many more of like import might readily have been added) the gracious intendments of God in his Patience, towards the generality of men, and more eſpecially towards the wicked, are very emphatically aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this by way of encouragement and invitation unto them to Repent, that ſo they might be ſaved. But concerning any ſuch intentions of God in His Patience, determinately towards Beleevers, or His Elect, I finde the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſilent altogether.</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) The ſence of the <hi>Scripture</hi> in hand contended for, is atteſted by Mr <hi>Calvin</hi> Himſelf, over and over.

               <hi>Aretius</hi> in his brief Commentary upon the Place, compares it, for ſence, and import, with three of thoſe four Texts lately cited, <hi>viz. Rom. 2. Ezek. 18. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 4. in all which (as we obſerved) the Patience of God towards the generality of men, or towards ſinful men, in order to their Repentance and Salvation hereupon, is clearly avouched; but not the leaſt mention or intimation of any confinement or appropriation of this His Patience, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments either of Repentance, or Salvation, therein, unto righteous men, or His Elect. Therefore (queſtionleſs) this Orthodox Author alſo corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondeth with us in the Interpretation given. Dr <hi>Ames</hi> upon the place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, That <hi>the Patience of God, in it's own nature hath this uſe and end,</hi> viz. <hi>to allure</hi> [or, invite] <hi>ſinners unto Repentance: Rom.</hi> 2. 4. And <hi>in this ſence</hi> He granteth, that <hi>their Expoſition may be admitted, who underſtand theſe words, and the like, of all, and every particular man</hi>

That He doth not ſpeak Verſ. 8. of the <hi>Elect,</hi> as <hi>ſuch,</hi> or in their capacity of <hi>Election,</hi> but onely ſtiles thoſe, to whom He there ſpeaks, <hi>Bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ved;</hi> which onely imports His affection towards them, as they were Saints, or Beleevers, or rather as they were ſo judged by Him. 2. Whereas He numbers Himſelf with thoſe, to whom, and of whom, He ſpeaketh, it no ways proveth, or ſuppoſeth, that He numbereth Himſelf in reſpect of His <hi>Election,</hi> with them, or of His Saintſhip, eſpecially conſidering that He ſpeaketh not, either to them, or of them, as they were <hi>Elect,</hi> as we have proved at large in the traverſe of the words. And whereas He grants, That <hi>the Patience of God, hath in its own nature this uſe and end, that it allures</hi> (or draws) <hi>Sinners to Repentance;</hi> doth He conceive, that this nature of it is altered or changed for the worſe, by any Intentions of God, in reſpect of what ſinners ſoever? Or doth He think that God diſſolveth or deſtroyeth the proper operativeneſs, or tendency, of any of His Diſpenſations, in order, either to procure the perpetration of more ſin in the world, or to the extenuation of the demerit, or puniſhment, of men, who live and dye impenitent and obdurate in their ſins? Or is there any other end imaginable, but onely one, or both of theſe, why the <hi>Patience of God,</hi> which in <hi>its own nature, hath this uſe and end, to draw ſinners to Repentance,</hi> ſhould be deveſted of them by God?</p>
            <p>But againſt the Expoſition given, and maintained, ſome things are object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> Firſt: If the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould defer His Coming, or be <hi>patient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men</hi> without exception, in order to their <hi>Repentance,</hi> that ſo they may <hi>not periſh,</hi> He muſt defer it for ever, and ſo never come: in as much as that day will never come, wherein all men will <hi>Repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That it is neither the ſence of the Text, nor yet of the Interpretation given, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be <hi>patient unto all men,</hi> or defer His Coming, until all men without exception ſhould actually <hi>Repent:</hi> but that His intent, and deſire, in His <hi>Patience towards all men,</hi> is, that they ſhould <hi>repent,</hi> and be ſaved, and that He doth by His Patience and <hi>long-ſuffering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men,</hi> afford unto them means and opportunities ſufficient to bring them all to Repentance. How ſuch Intentions, and Deſires, in God and in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which are real and cordial, may yet very poſſibly never take place, or be fulfilled, hath been ſhewed (in part) formerly <note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 2. Sect. 14 cap. 3. ſect. 7, 11, &amp;c. cap. 10. ſect. 43.</note>, and remains to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opened in convenient place.</p>
            <p>Another Objection levyed by ſome againſt the Interpretation avouched
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:94900:231"/> (which yet in part falls in with the former, and is already fallen with it) is this: If <hi>Chriſt</hi> certainly knows, knoweth before-hand, that all men without exception will not <hi>repent,</hi> or, will not be <hi>ſaved,</hi> how can it be thought, that He ſhould will, intend, or deſire, that they ſhould <hi>repent,</hi> or, that they ſhould be ſaved? Doth any ſober man, will, or intend ſuch a thing, which he certainly knows beforehand, will never be effected?</p>
            <p>To this ſufficient Anſwer hath been given in the Premiſſes <note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 3. Sect. 7, 11, &amp;c.</note>, where we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered this for a general Rule, to direct to a right underſtanding of Scripture Anthropopathies, and attributions of humane things unto God; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>it is not neceſſary that all things accompanying, or relating unto theſe affections, or impreſsions in men, which are attributed unto God, ſhould be parallel'd in Him, or have ſomething in His Nature correſponding to them: but that it is a ſufficient Ground or Reaſon for the Attribution, in caſe the humane affection, or impreſsion, attributed to Him, he, in reſpect of any one Particular, appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it in men, parallel'd, or analogized, in the Nature of God.</hi> Which Rule I explain in the place referred unto, by ſeveral inſtances. From hence it follows, though ſober men never intend, or will, what they certainly know beforehand will never come to paſs, that yet God may (and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi>) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reflexion of diſparagement unto Him in the leaſt, intend and will, what He certainly foreknoweth (in ſuch a ſence as foreknowledg is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto Him, of which formerly <note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 3. Sect. 2, 3, &amp;c.</note>) will never come to paſs. The Reaſon is, becauſe Intentions, and acts of willing, which are properly and formally in men, and not in God, are not attributed unto God, in all, or every reſpect, or in reſpect of all circumſtances, which relate unto them in men, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect onely of ſuch productions or effects, as they ordinarily produce in men. As for example, when men will, or intend ſuch, or ſuch, a thing, if the act of their will in this caſe be raiſed to any conſiderable ſtrength, or height of willing, they engage themſelves in the uſe of ſuch means, for the effecting of what they intend, or will, in this kinde, which they judg competent and ſufficient hereunto. In like manner God in propriety of Scripture language, is ſaid to <hi>intend,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> the Repentance and Salvation of men, becauſe He vouchſafeth a ſufficiency of means unto them to effect their Repentance, and Salvation hereupon; and chargeth them from Heaven to uſe theſe means accordingly. And in as much as He vouchſafeth this ſufficiency of means unto, and impoſeth the charge we ſpeak of, upon, all men without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, He may upon good grounds be ſaid to <hi>intend,</hi> or <hi>will,</hi> the Repentance and Salvation of all, without exception. It is a common ſaying amongſt all Expoſitors of Scripture, as well Proteſtant, as Popiſh, that <hi>Humana tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feruntur in Deum, non affectivè, ſed effectivè: i. e.</hi> Humane Paſſions, or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are aſcribed unto God, not by way of affect, but effect; <hi>i. e.</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the affections themſelves are in Him, but becauſe there proceed ſuch effects from Him, which are like unto the effects that flow from ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in men.</p>
            <p>If it be here demanded; but if God certainly foreſeeth, or foreknoweth,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> that the means and opportunities which He vouchſafeth unto men, to bring them to Repentance, and ſo to Salvation, will miſcarry, and never take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but turn to ſo much the greater condemnation of thoſe, to whom they are vouchſafed, can any vouchſafement of ſuch means and opportunities as theſe, unto men, be interpreted, or look'd upon, as proceeding from any love or grace in Him towards ſuch Perſons, who He certainly knows beforehand will reject them? or as any ways obliging ſuch Perſons unto thankfulneſs?</p>
            <pb n="425" facs="tcp:94900:231"/>
            <p>If I certainly knew that the gift of an hundred Pound unto my Son, or friend, would turn to ſome ſad inconvenience unto them, as to the deſtruction of their lives, to the bereaving of them of their wits, or the like, would it be matter of love, kindneſs, or reſpect in me towards them, to give it unto them? Or ſhould I not deal more kindly by them, not to give it in ſuch a caſe? To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. When God vouchſafeth unto men things which are in themſelves, and in their natures, good, beneficial, and of worthy concernment unto men, and they who receive them, very capable of employing them accordingly, He no ways hindering them from making an anſwerable uſe of them, but many ways encouraging, perſwading, and preſſing them hereunto, is there any Reaſon, or colour of a Reaſon, why He ſhould be thought leſs gracious, or loving, to ſuch men, onely becauſe He knows beforehand, that they will make no ſuch uſe of them? Or would the ſame, or the like vouchſafements from Him, ſavor of any whit the more grace, love, or goodneſs, in caſe it could, or ſhould, be ſuppoſed that He were ignorant, what uſe ſuch men would make of them, or whether they would convert them to their deſtruction, or no? Or is there any Reaſon that the Knowledg of God, ſhould be turned to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or diſparagement of His goodneſs?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As He certainly foreſees that ſome men WILL turn His Grace into wantonneſs, and render themſelves liable to the greater condemnation by the abuſe of thoſe means, which He vouchſafeth unto them for their Salvation; ſo He as certainly knows, and foreſeeth likewiſe, that they MAY do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if they pleaſe, (I mean, improve theſe means to the obtaining of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) that His foreſight of what they WILL do, notwithſtanding.

Nor would they have ever a whit the more liberty, or Power, to refrain an action, or courſe, in caſe it ſhould be ſuppoſed, that God doth not certainly foreſee what they will do on either hand, refrain, or act and practiſe. So that God is never the leſs gracious unto men in His vouchſafement of ſufficient means of Salvation unto them, becauſe He foreſees they will abuſe them. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) I anſwer further, that there is not the ſame conſideration, of God, and of men, in reſpect of ſuch actions, or gifts, the iſſue or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof, the one, and the other, are, or may be, ſaid to foreſee, that they will prove evil to thoſe that receive them. In caſe a man ſhould foreſee ſuch, or ſuch an event, in one kinde or other, that would certainly follow upon any act or gift of His, His foreſight would be ſuch literally and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>i. e.</hi> He ſhould have knowledg of the event, before He had done the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or given the gift, the event whereof He is ſaid to foreſee, or foreknow. But now God, though He be ſaid to foreſee the iſſue or event of any action, or gift, of His, yet He is not ſaid, properly, or as the word ſounds in ordinary acception with men, to foreſee it: <hi>i. e.</hi> He doth not firſt, or antecedaneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of time, foreſee it, or ſee it, before the action be performed by Him, or the gift given, the event whereof He is ſaid to foreſee. For as God Himſelf is not meaſured by time, ſo neither are any of His Actions: and it is a generally received Maxim in Theology, admitted by all Divines, That <hi>God willeth nothing in time</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Deus potest nihil velle in tempore; Deus non poteſt non habere volitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, quam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet. Non poteſt habere volitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, quam non habet.</hi> Daven Animadverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. p. 484</note>, but all things, in, or from, Eternity. Now there is the ſame reaſon, or conſideration, of His Foreknowledg, which there
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:94900:232"/> is of His Will. As He willeth nothing in time, ſo neither doth He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know, or foreſee, any thing in time: His foreſeeing of things being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing really but Himſelf (as all His Actions are) it muſt needs be as ancient as Himſelf, and co-eternal with Himſelf. So likewiſe that Act of His, whereby He gives, or imparts, any thing unto men, though the gift it ſelf given by it, doth not come to the hands of men, or to be received by men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſuch or ſuch a time, yet this Act it ſelf of His, was from Eternity <note n="c" place="margin">See this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued at large, &amp; fully clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Cap. 4. Sec. 14, 15, &amp;c.</note>; and conſequently is not capable of being foreſeen by God, becauſe it was as anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as any foreſight, or foreknowledg in God, yea, as God Himſelf. And for the ſad event or conſequent of this action, or gift of His, unto men, though He may (in a ſence, formerly declared <note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 2. Sect. 2. 6.</note>) be ſaid to foreſee it, becauſe it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in time: yet in as much as that act paſſed from Him from Eternity, and ſo was from Eternity irreverſible, by which the gift, or gifts, ſorting to ſo ſad an event in the Receiver, were conferred upon Him in time, there is no Reaſon, nor colour of Reaſon, why He ſhould be thought to give ſuch gifts, being in themſelves good, and worthy His infinite goodneſs, out of any whit the leſs love, grace, or mercy towards Him, who receiveth them, becauſe He foreſaw (after His manner of foreſeeing) that they would be abuſed by Him to His harm; eſpecially conſidering that it was not in his Power (I mean, in the Power of God) to have done more towards the preventing of ſuch an abuſe of them by ſuch a man, then He did. It cannot be thought, but that God did foreſee that the <hi>Jews</hi> of old would <hi>mock His Meſſengers, and deſpiſe His Words, and miſ-uſe His Prophets, until His Wrath aroſe againſt them, and till there was no remedy;</hi> yet the vouchſafement of theſe means of Grace and of Repentance (the <hi>ſending</hi> of his <hi>Meſſengers, Words, and Prophets</hi> unto them) is expreſly attributed unto his <hi>Compaſsion [i. e.</hi> his love of pity, or benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs of affection] towards them. <hi>And the Lord God of their Fathers ſent to them by His Meſſengers, riſing up betimes and ſending;</hi> BECAVSE HE HAD COMPASSION ON HIS PEOPLE, <hi>and on His dwelling place: 2 Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16. In like manner our Saviour certainly foreſaw that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards would not <hi>underſtand,</hi> or accept of, <hi>the things of Her peace,</hi> the means of her ſafety and preſervation; yet he aſcribes the vouchſafement of them unto her, unto a genuine tenderneſs of love and care in him towards her, and her children. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, as an Hen gathereth Her Chickens under Her wing, and ye would not: Mat.</hi> 23. 37.</p>
            <p>But is it not (it is like you will demand) in the Power of God, abſolutely<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> to prevent the abuſe of thoſe good gifts of his we ſpeak of, by the Receivers, and conſequently to do more towards the preventing of this abuſe, then he doth?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, No: both Reaſon, and Religion (which yet is nothing but Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in her exaltation) teach us to judg and ſay, that it is not in the Power of <hi>God</hi> to prevent the abuſe of thoſe good gifts we ſpeak of, in the Receivers, otherwiſe then now he doth prevent it, (<hi>viz.</hi> by affording ſufficient means unto them for the prevention of it,) this (I ſay) neither was, nor is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſound Principles both of Reaſon, and Religion, any whit more in the Power of God to do, then it is in his Power, to lye, deceive, oppreſs, or do any other thing moſt unworthy of him. For he that is Omnipotent, muſt needs be Omniprudent alſo: and he that is Omniprudent, cannot do any thing in the leaſt degree repugnant to the moſt rigid and diſtrict Principles
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:94900:232"/> of the moſt perfect Wiſdom, and Prudence, that is. We ſee it amongſt men, that the wiſer any man is in reality and truth, ſo much the leſs liberty, or Power, he hath to do any thing contrary to the Laws and Dictates of true Wiſdom: and the weaker and more defective any man is in this Wiſdom, the more liberty and Power he hath to do fooliſhly, or uncomely. What was it that made <hi>Joſeph</hi> unable to commit that great wickedneſs, whereunto he was ſollicited by his Miſtreſs? <hi>How</hi> CAN <hi>I do this great wickedneſs</hi> (ſaith he <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 39. 9.</note>?) meaning, that he COVLD not do it: whereas (doubtleſs) there were men enough in the World, that both could, and would have done, ſuch a thing as that, though he COVLD not. So what was it, that made <hi>Paul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do any thing againſt the Truth, and able onely to act for the Truth? [<hi>For we,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 8</note>.] Whereas there were, and are at this day, thouſands in the World, <hi>able i. e.</hi> at liberty in their Wills and Conſciences to act ten times more againſt the Truth, then for the Truth. The true Reaſon why neither of theſe men had any Power, were not able to do thoſe unworthy things, which a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men had Power enough to do, was, becauſe they had ſo much true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in them above other men, which would not ſuffer them to do ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly and unworthy things. And generally we finde it, that the more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and prudently conſciencious men, or women, are, the more they are bound up in themſelves, and have ſo much the leſs liberty or Power to do things that are uncomely, then other men. So then God, being infinitely more wiſe, and that with the trueſt and beſt Wiſdom that can be imagined, then the wiſeſt of men, muſt needs in a way of Reaſon be conceived to be more bound up in Himſelf, to have leſs liberty or Power to do any thing contrary to any Rule, Dictate, or Principle of the moſt exquiſite Wiſdom that is, then any creature whatſoever, whether Men, or Angels. The Apoſtle (as is well known) breaks forth in an holy kinde of aſtoniſhment, upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Wiſdom and Knowledg of God: <hi>O the depths of the riches both of the Wiſdom, and Knowledg, of God! How unſearchable are His Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> [meaning, that for matter of <hi>Wiſdom, and Knowledg,</hi> by which they are ordered, managed, and adminiſtred, they are <hi>unſearchable; viz.</hi> to the bottom, or in reſpect of all the ſtrains, or variety of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> that are in them,] <hi>and his ways</hi> [in reſpect of the numberleſs ingredients of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which He puts into them] <hi>paſt finding out</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 11. 33</note>. So then it being contrary to the Laws and Rules of true Wiſdom, or of that infinite Wiſdom which rules in God, for him to act his Creatures (at leaſt ordinarily) in oppoſition to thoſe natural and eſſential Properties and Principles, which himſelf hath planted in them, it may eaſily be conceived, how, and in what reſpect, he hath no Power, <hi>i. e.</hi> no liberty in himſelf, to prevent the ruine of his Creature (Man) further, or otherwiſe, then by ſuch an interpoſure of Himſelf, or of his Grace, in order hereunto, which will, in reſpect of any forcibleneſs or efficacy in working, well conſiſt with the natural and eſſential freedom and liberty of his Will. In reſpect whereof the utmoſt line or extent of the liberty or Power of God, is to proceed no further with men, nor with any man at any time, in the vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafement of Grace, or means of Grace, in order to the preventing of their ruine and deſtruction, then to leave them a Power at leaſt, or Poſſibility, of rejecting the Grace offered unto them, and ſo to ruine and deſtroy themſelves. Nor (doubtleſs) did God ever go further, or riſe higher, then this, no not in the moſt ſignal or miraculous Converſions, which either we read of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>in the Scriptures, or otherwiſe have heard of (according to Truth.) I ſuppoſe there
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:94900:233"/> is not a greater or more notable inſtance in this kinde, then that of the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Paul,</hi> which (we know) was effected in a very extraordinary way, and with as high an hand of means, as ever was lifted up by God for the converſion of a man, as <hi>viz.</hi> by a Viſion of the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf from Heaven, in ſplendor and great glory, ſpeaking with an audible voyce unto him; although I know not whether it be neceſſary to ſuppoſe, that the work of <hi>Pauls</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion was perfected (I mean, ſpecifically perfected, for gradually I preſume it was not) by this Viſion onely, or until <hi>Ananias,</hi> to whom the Viſion directed him, had made known unto him thoſe things, concerning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which he did. But whether his Converſion was ſpecifically perfected by the Viſion, without <hi>Ananias</hi> his Miniſtry, or no, doubtleſs there was a liberty, or poſſibility, left in <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, to the very laſt moment, or minute of time, before this his Converſion was actually wrought, to have, not onely reſiſted, but even fruſtrated all the means that were uſed for the effecting of it; fruſtrated I mean, not ſimply, or univerſally, as if <hi>Christ</hi> ſhould have been diſappointed, and loſt all he had done in order to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, in caſe he had not been converted; but fruſtrated, in reſpect of that particular end, his Converſion. For God hath always more ends, then one (though but one primary, and antecedent) in vouchſafing means of Grace and Salvation unto men: and whether he obtains the one, or the other, it is of much alike concernment unto him; according to that of the Apoſtle; <hi>For we</hi> [Apoſtles, or Miniſters of the Goſpel] <hi>are unto God</hi> [in our Miniſtry] <hi>a ſweet</hi> [or, the ſweet] <hi>ſavor of Chriſt, [i. e.</hi> we render <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by a diligent and faithful ſpreading abroad the knowledg of them in the world, as full of ſatisfaction and contentment unto God, as they are capable of being improved unto,] <hi>in them that are ſaved, and in thoſe that periſh,</hi> [meaning, that the deſtruction of thoſe, who periſh, through a<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 15.</note> rejection of his rich Grace in <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered to them, is matter of good ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction unto him, even as the Salvation of thoſe is, who accept of this Grace from him.] So that let men, who have <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and means of Salvation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto them, take either the right hand, or the left, God will be no loſer by them: his counſels and ends, of one kinde or other, will be advanced how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.

            <p>Yet give me leave to add one thing further here, of neceſſary conſideration<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> for the full clearing of the buſineſs in hand. Though it be well conſiſtent with the Wiſdom of God, and the Principles thereof, to riſe ſometimes, and in ſome caſes, in the vouchſafement of the means of Grace, and of Salvation unto men, to the higheſt pin or degree, in point of efficacy and Power, which the native and eſſential freedom and liberty of the Will, will bear; yet is it not conſiſtent with this Wiſdom of his to do it often, much leſs ordinarily, or of courſe. The Wiſdom of a Man leads and teacheth him, ſometimes, upon occaſion, and in order to ſome more then ordinary deſign, to vary from his cuſtomary and conſtant courſe of acting; yea though this cuſtomary and conſtant courſe of his be ſimply the beſt, and moſt agreeable to the Rules
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:94900:233"/> of Wiſdom, for him ordinarily to follow. Upon this account the wiſe man informeth us, That <hi>there is a time to kill, and a time to heal, a time t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note n="b" place="margin">Eccleſ. 3. 2. 3, &amp;c.</note>, (with ſeveral other inſtances of like import.) When he ſaith, <hi>there is a time</hi> to do this, and <hi>a time</hi> to do that which is contrary unto it, his meaning clearly is, that it is prudential, and agreeable to Rules of Wiſdom, for a man, according to time, place, and other circumſtances, to vary the manner and kinde of his ordinary actions, yea to act at one time with a kinde of contrariety to himſelf at another. In like manner it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſiſtent with the infinite Wiſdom of God upon ſome ſpecial occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in order to ſome gracious deſign, to open the hand of his bounty in the vouchſafement of means of Salvation unto Men, much wider, then will ſtand with the ſame Wiſdom to do ordinarily, or at another time. And as it may be truly ſaid of a truly wiſe man, that he cannot <hi>caſt away ſtones,</hi> when the <hi>time is</hi> for him <hi>to gather ſtones together;</hi> and ſo on the contrary, that he cannot <hi>gather ſtones together,</hi> when the <hi>time</hi> and ſeaſon is to <hi>caſt them away;</hi> ſuch a man cannot miſ-time his actions, becauſe his Wiſdom, which frames and faſhions both the conſents, and diſſents of his Will, cannot frame or raiſe a conſent of Will in him, to do any thing contrary to it ſelf, or to its own Nature and Principles, <hi>i. e.</hi> to do any thing uncomely, or imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſo may it truly be ſaid of God in the matter of granting means of Faith, and of Salvation, unto men, that he cannot in the ordinary and ſtanding courſe of his Providence, or Diſpenſation of ſuch Means, riſe ſo high, give Means of that tranſcendent Nature, Efficacy, and Power, which he can, and doth, give now and then, in ſome ſpecial caſes, and in order to ſome great and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial end. As for example: God was able, no Principle of his Wiſdom op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, to vouchſafe unto <hi>Paul</hi> that extraordinary means of beleeving, or for his Converſion, which we ſpake of, a glorious Viſion from Heaven. But it doth not follow from hence, that therefore he is able (we ſtill ſpeak of his Moral ability, or of the ability of his Will) to afford the like Viſion, or any other means like unto that for efficacy, and converting Power, ordinarily, or unto all other men. When he demands thus concerning his ancient Church and People of the <hi>Jews, What could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Iſai. 5. 4.</note>? He had not done any ſuch thing in it, or for it, as he did afterwards for <hi>Paul:</hi> nor had he multiplyed thoſe Miracles, and great works of wonder, ſome Particulars whereof he did work for them, and amongſt them, to ſuch a number, or with ſuch frequency, as by his Power ſimply conſidered, and without relation unto his Wiſdom, he was able to have done: and yet he might truly ſay and profeſs unto them (as his demand menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned imports) that he <hi>could do no more for them</hi> [to make them fruitful, to bring them to Repentance, and ſo to make them a proſperous and happy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple] <hi>then He had done; i. e.</hi> He had done the uttermoſt which his Wiſdom, in ſuch a caſe as theirs was, permitted him to do. So when he vouchſafeth a greater ſufficiency of means to one City, then he doth to another, (as he did to <hi>Capernaum</hi> above <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi>) to one Nation, then to another, to one age, or generation of men, then to another, the Reaſon of this difference is to be reſolved into the ſame infinite uniform, though <hi>manifold, Wiſdom of God</hi> (as the Apoſtle calleth it,) or (which is the ſame) into <hi>the Counſel of his Will</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Epheſ. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11</note>; not ſimply into his <hi>Will,</hi> but into the <hi>Counſel of His Will, [i. e.</hi> that infinite Wiſdom, or Prudence, by which his <hi>Will</hi> is, as it were ſteered and directed in all the motions and actings thereof,] <hi>according</hi> unto which <hi>counſel,</hi>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:94900:234"/> he is ſaid to <hi>work all things</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 1. 11.</note>. And it may be as truly, and as properly, ſaid of him, when he vouchſafeth the leaſt and loweſt ſufficiency of means, unto ſome men, as when he affordeth the greateſt and richeſt of all, unto others, that he did, or doth, what he could, or what he is able to do, as well for the one, as for the other. And in ſuch caſes of difference as theſe, that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtle (lately mentioned) is moſt ſeaſonable and proper: <hi>O the depths of the riches both of the Wiſdom, and Knowledg of God! How unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are His Judgments, and His ways paſt finding out</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note>! By his <hi>Judgments</hi> (in this place) we are not (I conceive) to underſtand onely his penal inflictions upon men in one kinde, or other, but his diſpenſatory Adminiſtrations, as he is the Judg, and great Ruler of the World, indefinitely conſidered, as well ſuch as are Munificent, as thoſe which are Penal: and ſo the word, <hi>Ways,</hi> in the latter part of the Verſe, added (it is like) for explication, indifferently implies as well the one, as the other. But how, or in what reſpect, are his <hi>Judgments,</hi> or <hi>Ways</hi> of Adminiſtration in the World, ſaid to be <hi>unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> or <hi>paſt finding out?</hi> The former part of the Verſe clearly informeth us of this; as <hi>viz.</hi> that they are <hi>unſearchable</hi> in reſpect of that abundance of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledg,</hi> by which, and according unto which, they are firſt ordered and contrived, and then executed, by him. Firſt, they are <hi>unſearchable [viz.</hi> unto Men, yea and to Angels too] in reſpect of that moſt abſolute and perfect <hi>Knowledg,</hi> which God hath of every particular circumſtance, from the leaſt to the greateſt, of all the actions and ways of all the Men in the World, and ſo of all Cities, and of all Nations, in all ſucceeding gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, from the Morning of the World, until the preſent hour thereof: upon which actions, with all and every their reſpective circumſtances, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and layd together by God, as by Reaſon of his perfect <hi>Knowledg</hi> of them they readily may be, he builds and forms, by means of his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (of which preſently) that entire <hi>ſeries,</hi> or Tenor of his Adminiſtrations, as well Munificent, as Penal, which from day to day, and from age to age, take place in the World amongſt the Sons and Daughters of Men. Now becauſe neither Men, nor Angels, are capable of knowing, or conſidering, all that infinite and endleſs multitude and variety of actions, with all their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances reſpectively, which are done in the World, upon which, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the exigency of which (not any one of them, from the greateſt to the leaſt, omitted, or left out) the Providential Adminiſtrations of God in the World, as well of Juſtice, as of Mercy and Goodneſs, are founded and framed, hence it is that the Apoſtle concludes (in a poſture of admiration) that the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God <hi>are unſearchable, and His Ways paſt finding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>depths of the riches of that Knowledg,</hi> which he maketh uſe of in forming them; meaning, that no Creature who knoweth not as much as God himſelf knoweth, concerning the Grounds and Reaſons, why he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the Affairs of the World, of Perſons, of Cities, of Countries, of Ages, as he doth, and not otherwiſe, can poſſibly underſtand, or <hi>comprehend</hi> the abſolute exactneſs and accurateneſs of them; how ever he may <hi>apprehend</hi> ſomewhat, yea much, of them, I mean chiefly, concerning the Equity and Righteouſneſs of them.</p>
            <p>Again, 2. Theſe <hi>Judgments</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi> of God are <hi>unſearchable and past</hi>

               <hi>finding out,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>depths of the riches of that Wiſdom</hi> which is in God, according unto which alſo, they are all calculated and formed by him. For look as in a Judg, who is to adminiſter Juſtice, and to give ſentence in the Cauſes of Men that are brought before him, there ought to be theſe two
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:94900:234"/> things, 1. A perfect <hi>Knowledg</hi> of the reſpective Caſes, wherein he is to give ſentence, in all circumſtances relating to them, before he doth give ſentence. 2. A Principle of Wiſdom, to weigh and ponder aright every of theſe caſes in all their circumſtances reſpectively, that ſo he may be able to form ſuch a ſentence, wherein every circumſtance, great and ſmall, relating to every caſe, may have its due conſideration and weight. So there are, and of neceſſity muſt be in God, to make him an abſolute Judg (as he is) of all the World, 1. Such a perfect <hi>Knowledg</hi> as we ſpeak of, of all caſes that are before him in all the World, with all and every particular circumſtance relating to every of them: 2. An abſoluteneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perfection of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> alſo, 1. To inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret every particular circumſtance relating to every particular action, and caſe, in the World, according to true Principles of Juſtice and Equity, ſo as to be able to ſay, how much better, or how much worſe, ſuch, or ſuch an action is by reaſon of ſuch, or ſuch, a circumſtance, one, or more; 2. To raiſe or frame ſuch a ſentence (and to adminiſter and execute it accordingly) which ſhall be made up (as it were) of the equitable reſults of all, and every of thoſe circumſtances, which are to be taken into conſideration in every award. Now the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> which God maketh uſe of in both theſe ways, in, and about the Government of the World, hath ſo many unfathomable <hi>depths</hi> in it, is ſo <hi>rich</hi> above meaſure, ſo unconceivable, incomprehenſible, in the diſcerning abilities, and eſtimative worth of it, that thoſe judiciary acts and ways which proceed from it, and are molded and formed by the ſpirit and ſtrength of it, are greater then all created underſtanding, above all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, either by Men, or Angels.</p>
            <p>By the light of what hath been now argued, it fully appeareth, 1. That all ſuch men, who <hi>turn the Grace of God</hi> in thoſe worthy means of Salvation, which he vouchſafeth unto them, <hi>into wantonneſs,</hi> and are not in concluſion ſaved by them, but periſh ſo much the more grievouſly, are notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much obliged in point of thankfulneſs unto him for them, as they could have been, in caſe they ſhould be ſaved by them. 2. That the vouchſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and beſtowing of ſuch means upon them by God, notwithſtanding the certainty of his foreknowledg (as foreknowledg is attributable unto him) that they will not prove ſaving unto them in the end, are yet Arguments and Pledges of as much Grace, Love, and Mercy unto them, as they would, or could, be, in caſe he had as certainly foreknown that they would be of a ſaving conſequence unto them. 3. That God, his infinite Wiſdom conſidered, and the obligements thereof upon him, goeth as far, doth as much, to render the means of Grace exhibited unto thoſe who periſh, effectual to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as is poſſible for him to do. 4. (And laſtly) That that foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, which is in God, of the future abuſe and miſcarrying of the means of Salvation, in thoſe to whom they are exhibited or vouchſafed by him, doth not precede that act of his, by which they are exhibited unto them, this being eternal, or from Eternity, as well as that.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Declaring in what ſence, the former Paſſages of Scripture aſſerting the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality of Redemption by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are (as to this Point) to be understood: and conſequently, in what ſence the ſaid Doctrine of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemption, is maintained in the preſent Diſcourſe.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ALthough an intelligent and obſervant Reader, may from ſeveral Paſſages<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> occaſionally inſerted here and there in the Precedure of this Diſcourſe, clearly enough perceive and underſtand, in what ſence, and with what Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Proviſo's, the ſaid Doctrine of Univerſal Redemption by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is aſſerted and maintained herein, and conſequently in what ſence the Author underſtandeth all thoſe Texts of Scripture, which hold forth the ſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine unto the World (many of which have been formerly produced upon the account,) yet that the Reader may readily, without either burthening His Memory, or ſpending time in turning over Leaves, know where to finde his minde and ſence concerning both, fully explained, I judged it not amiſs to devote one entire Chapter unto his ſervice herein. Therefore,</p>
            <p>1. (To expreſs our Meaning in the ſaid Doctrine, negatively, or rather our non-meaning) When, with the Scriptures, we affirm and teach, that <hi>Chriſt dyed for all Men, [i. e.</hi> for the Redemption, and Salvation, of <hi>all men,</hi> without exception of any: for we do not finde in Scripture that He dyed for any, for whoſe Salvation He dyed not,] we do not mean, or ſuppoſe, either, 1. That He dyed ſufficiently onely for all Men, [<hi>i. e.</hi> onely that there was price, or merit, enough in his Death for the Redemption of <hi>all Men:</hi>] Or, 2. That God, or Himſelf, did every ways, or in every reſpect, as <hi>viz.</hi> both antecedently, and conſequently, intend the Redemption, or Salvation, of <hi>all Men,</hi> in, or by His Death. Nor, 3. do we mean, or ſuppoſe, in the ſaid Doctrine, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed, ſo, or upon ſuch terms, for all Men, that all Men ſhall in time, or at laſt, be actually redeemed [from ſin and miſery] or eternally ſaved, by His Death. Nor, 4. do we ſuppoſe, that God (or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as God) intends the Salvation of all Men, or of any Man, or Men, by <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death, with Intentions, formally, or properly, ſo called, or ſuch as are found in Men. Nor, 5. do we mean, or ſuppoſe, in the Doctrine avouched, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> by His Death, purchaſed, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the infuſion, or gift, either of Faith, or Repentance, for all Men, or (indeed) for any Man, or numbers of Men, perſonally conſidered. Nor, 6. (and laſtly, for our Negative) that by His ſaid Death He purchaſed, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Pardon, or Forgiveneſs of ſins, for all Men, or for any Man, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men, ſimply conſidered, or as ſuch, and ſuch Men, by Name. But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. (For our ſence and Meaning, in the Affirmative) We hold, and mean (in the Doctrine ſpecified) that there was a reality of Intention on Gods part (in ſuch a ſence as reality of Intention is appropriable unto Him, which ſence we opened at large formerly <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 3. Sect. 17.</note>, and ſhall briefly again declare in this Chapter,) that, as there was a valuable conſideration, or worth of merit in the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> fully competent and ſufficient for the Ranſom, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, of all Men, ſo it ſhould be equally, and upon the ſame terms, erogable, or appliable unto all Men, in order to their Redemption, without any difference, or ſpecial contraction or limitation of it unto ſome, more then others.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:94900:235"/>2. We hold and mean, in, and about the Premiſſes, that God did onely antecedently intend the actual Redemption and Salvation of all Men, in, and by, the Death of <hi>Christ:</hi> but conſequently, the Redemption and Salvation onely of ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe who ſhall beleeve. What it is to will, or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,</hi> a thing <hi>antecedently,</hi> and what, <hi>conſequently,</hi> hath been ſhewed former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 6. Sect. 16.</note>: and ſhall (God willing) be ſomewhat further opened in this Chapter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When we teach, that <hi>Christ</hi> dyed for all Men, we intend and mean, that there is a poſſibility, yea a fair and gracious poſſibility, for all Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, conſidered as Men, without, and before, their voluntary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration by actual ſinning, to obtain actual Salvation by his Death: ſo that in caſe any Man periſheth, his deſtruction is altogether from himſelf, there being as much, and as much intended, in the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> for, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the procuring of his Salvation, as there is for procuring the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any of thoſe, who come to be actually ſaved.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When (with the Scriptures) we deliver this, for a Doctrine of Truth, that <hi>Chriſt dyed for all Men,</hi> we ſuppoſe and mean, that God <hi>intends</hi> the Salvation of all Men by this Death, onely ſo, after ſuch a manner, or with ſuch a kinde of Intention, which is competible to, and conſiſtent with, His infinite ſimplicity and Perfection of Being. Of this kinde of <hi>Intention</hi> we argued in our third Chapter, where we gave a particular and clear account of it: and ſhall take it the ſecond time into ſome brief conſideration in this Chapter. This Particular is of affinity with the firſt, but is not altogether the ſame.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When we teach, that <hi>Christ</hi> dyed for all Men, we mean, not onely that He put all Men without exception, into a capability of being ſaved (as <hi>viz.</hi> by beleeving,) but alſo that He wholly diſſolved, and took off from all Men, the guilt and condemnation, which was brought upon all Men by <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſgreſſion. So that now no Man ſhall periſh, or be condemned, but upon his own perſonal account, and for ſuch ſins onely which ſhall be actually and voluntarily committed by him, or for ſuch omiſſions, which was in his power to have prevented.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When with the Scriptures we affirm, that <hi>Christ</hi> dyed for all Men, our ſence and meaning is, that by His Death, He procured this Grace and Favor with God for all Men without exception, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Him ſufficient ſtrength and means, or be enabled by Him, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and to beleeve, yea and to perſevere in both unto the end: and that in this ſence, and none other, He is, or may be, ſaid, to have by His Death pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the Grace of Faith, and Repentance for Men; and this upon equal terms, in an antecedent conſideration, for all Men.</p>
            <p n="7">7. (And laſtly) Our ſence and meaning in the ſaid Doctrine further is, that <hi>Christ</hi> by His Death purchaſed this tranſcendent Grace alſo, and Favor, in the ſight of God, for all Men without exception, that upon their Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Beleeving in Him, they ſhould be juſtified, and receive forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all their ſins; and that upon their Perſeverance in both unto the end, they ſhould be actually and eternally ſaved: and that in this ſence, and in this onely, He is, and may be, ſaid, to have purchaſed Juſtification, or Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, Redemption, Salvation, &amp;c. for Men, for any Man, or any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men; yea and in this ſence, for all Men.</p>
            <p>The imputation, from the guilt whereof we deſire in ſpecial manner to<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> waſh our hands in innocency, by this Explication, is, that as we hold Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Redemption, ſo we hold likewiſe Univerſal Salvation, or, that all Men
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:94900:236"/> ſhall be ſaved by <hi>Christ.</hi> That ſuch an Opinion as this is no conſequent of the Doctrine maintained in this Diſcourſe concerning the Death of <hi>Christ</hi> for all Men, ſufficiently appeareth from that ground, which we have layd and built upon, once and again, in the former part of this Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>ſuch Intentions and Deſires in God, and in Christ, which are real and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, may yet very poſsibly never take place, or be fulfilled.</hi> See what hath been propoſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and debated upon this account, Cap. 2. Sect. 13. And again, Cap. 3. Sect. 7. 11. &amp;c. And yet again, Cap. 10. Sect. 49. This ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed, it may very eaſily be conceived, that God may intend the Salvation of all Men by the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> and yet all Men not be ſaved. Which Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (I mean, that all Men ſhall be ſaved) as it hath no communion at all with the Doctrine avouched in this Diſcourſe, ſo hath it every whit as little with the Authors ſence or Judgment otherwiſe: who approveth the ſentence of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Synod aſſembled under the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Opinion, held (as it ſeems) by <hi>Origen</hi> with a ſuſpluſſage of Error joyned with it <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Origens</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was, not onely that all Men, but that all the Devils alſo ſhould at laſt be ſaved by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </note>, was condemned. Yea to me it ſeemeth not a little ſtrange, how any man profeſſing ſubjection of Judgment unto the Scriptures, ſhould ever come to a confederacy with ſuch an Opinion. For with what frequency, and evidence of expreſſion, do theſe riſe up againſt it, ever and anon intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and aſſerting on the one hand, the Paucity of thoſe that will, or ſhall, be ſaved, in compariſon of thoſe that will periſh, and on the other hand, the Perpetuity or everlaſtingneſs of the Perdition and miſery, of thoſe who do periſh? Nor do they give the leaſt intimation, or hope of releaſe from miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, unto thoſe, who dye in their ſins, and periſh in their unbelief. <hi>Enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Christ</hi> unto the children of men in His Doctrine upon the Mount,) <hi>for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and</hi> MANY <hi>there be that go in thereat:</hi> [but we read of none that return, or come out, <hi>thereat.] Becauſe ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and</hi> FEVV <hi>there be that finde it</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Matt. 7. 13; 14.</note>: [<hi>i. e.</hi> that <hi>finde it,</hi> either firſt, or laſt, or ever.] For that this is His Meaning, appears from theſe, and ſuch like ſayings. <hi>Wherefore if thine Hand cauſe thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, then having two hands, to go into Hell, into the fire that never ſhall be quenched:</hi> [He doth not ſay, <hi>into the fire</hi> that is hard to be <hi>quenched,</hi> or, which will be long in quenching; but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hath this import, which is likewiſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed by that which followeth,] <hi>Where their worm dyeth not, and the fire is not quenched</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Mark 9. 43, 44.</note>. Theſe expreſſions, <hi>dyeth not, is not quenched,</hi> though according to their preciſe Grammatical import, they onely deny the act, the one of <hi>dying,</hi> the other of <hi>quenching,</hi> yet according to Scripture-dialect, they deny alſo the very power, or poſſibility of theſe acts <note n="f" place="margin">Negatio actus ſaepe connotat etia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> negatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem potentia.</note>. For there is nothing more frequent here, then by the denyal of the act, to deny the power, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of a thing. Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 6. where our Tranſlation readeth, <hi>And the Land was not</hi> ABLE <hi>to bear them,</hi> the Original onely ſaith, <hi>And the Land</hi> DID <hi>not bear them,</hi> (as Mr <hi>Ainſworth</hi> alſo tranſlateth the place.) So <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 7. where our laſt Tranſlation, reſpecting the Original, hath it, <hi>He</hi> OPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETH NOT <hi>His mouth in the gate,</hi> our former Tranſlators, rather minding the ſence and import of the place, read it thus; <hi>He</hi> CANNOT OPEN <hi>His mouth in the gate;</hi> to omit many the like. So that when our Saviour ſaith,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:94900:236"/> concerning the eſtate of thoſe that <hi>go,</hi> or, are caſt, <hi>into Hell,</hi> that <hi>their worm dyeth not, and their fire is not quenched,</hi> His Meaning is, that <hi>their worm can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dye,</hi> nor <hi>their fire be quenched, [i. e.</hi> their puniſhment, or torment, can never have an end, or interruption, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Counſel of the Will of the Almighty hath reſolved againſt both, and judged it meet to make them eaſleſs and endleſs.] Upon this account alſo <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> ſaith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Christ,</hi> That <hi>He hath His Fan in His Hand, and will throughly purge His floor, and gather His Wheat into His Garner: but will burn up the Chaff with</hi> UNQUENCHABLE FIRE <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 3. 12.</note>. So likewiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> clearly teacheth, That <hi>the Lord Jeſus ſhall ſhew Himſelf from Heaven with His mighty Angels, In flaming fire, rendering vengeance unto them, that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Christ; who</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>ſhall be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with</hi> EVERLASTING DESTRVCTION <hi>from the preſence of the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1. 7, 8, 9.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this purpoſe, the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> reports it for the ſaying of an Angel unto him in his Viſion, that <hi>If any man worſhip the Beaſt and His image, and receive His mark in his forehead, or hand, The ſame ſhall d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This expreſſion, <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> ſo ſignally expreſſed in all the three Teſtimonies laſt recited, plainly imports, that the duration or continuance of the puniſhment, and torment, of thoſe who who periſh in their ſins, and are caſt into Hell, is not commenſurable with the continuance of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law (long ſince expired) which in the Old Teſtament is frequently ſignified by a word ſignifying, or at leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly rendered, <hi>for ever</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 28. 43 29. 28.

The notion and term likewiſe of the <hi>bottomleſs pit,</hi> frequently uſed in the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> to ſignifie the ſtate or condition of the damned, plainly enough imports the endleſſneſs, or everlaſtingneſs, of their miſery. If we could ſuppoſe a ditch, or pit, without a bottom, into the midſt of which a man ſhould be thrown, we could not, with congruity of notion, but ſuppoſe alſo, that this Perſon would be always falling, and that his motion, or fall, would never be at an end. The like apprehenſion (doubtleſs) concerning the caſe and ſtate of thoſe who dye in their ſins, in reſpect of their torment and miſery, the Holy Ghoſt ſeeks to form and plant in our Souls and Conſciences, by the Metaphor, or borrowed reſemblance of a <hi>bottomleſs pit.</hi> It were eaſie to multiply Texts of Scripture, to make that voyce, which hath now ſpoken unto us in thoſe laſt cited, far greater and louder: but thoſe which we have heard ſpeak al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the point, have ſpoken ſo plainly, that the reſt may keep ſilence (at the preſent) without loſs or diſadvantage to the Truth.</p>
            <p>Neither do the Scriptures ſo much as whiſper any thing of ſemblance, or<note place="margin">§. 3.</note>
               <pb n="436" facs="tcp:94900:237"/> comport, with the Opinion now rejected. As for that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 10. which ſome well-willers to the ſaid Opinion look upon, as ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with them in their judgments that way, it will, upon a due enquiry, be found of another ſpirit.—<hi>That in the Diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times</hi> (ſaith this place) <hi>He might gather together in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are on Earth, even in Him</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Epheſ. 1; 10</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereunto (for affinity ſake) we may joyn that from the ſame Pen: <hi>For it pleaſed the Father that in Him all fulneſs ſhould dwell, And (having made Peace through the blood of His Croſs) by Him to reconcile all things unto Himſelf, by Him (I ſay) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be things in Earth, or things in Heaven</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Col. 1. 19, 20</note>. From theſe Paſſages layd together, ſome judg it to be a very legitimate inference, that <hi>in the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fulneſs of times [i. e.</hi> as they underſtand, in due time, though it be very long before] <hi>all things, [i. e.</hi> all Perſons of Men, or Mankinde] <hi>whether in Heaven, or in Earth, [i. e.</hi> as well thoſe, who at preſent are at the greateſt diſtance from the Love and Favor of God, whether alive or dead, the Earth containing both, as thoſe that are already in His Favor, and therefore, in Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Glory] ſhall be <hi>gathered into one by Chriſt, [i. e.</hi> ſhall be <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto Him,</hi> and ſo be inveſted together in <hi>one</hi> and the ſame condition of Happineſs and Glory, by vertue of the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> who dyed for them all, and that to procure their actual reconcilement unto God, ſooner or later, however wickedly, and unbeleevingly, they ſhould either live, or dye.] But that ſuch a gloſs as this is quite beſides the Text, and the true import of it, is not hard to demonſtrate. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Neither of the ſaid Paſſages ſpeak of the event, iſſue, or ſucceſs of that glorious deſign of God by <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> ſpecified in them, but of the deſign it ſelf, or what was projected or intended by Him.

He ſuppoſeth further, that God did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the effecting of this his Deſign, by meer Power, or Prerogative-wiſe, I mean, ſo as to thruſt, or force <hi>Christ</hi> for an Head, either upon Men, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, nor yet to propound, or offer Him unto either for an Head, in his meer Naturals (if I may ſo ſpeak) unwrought, or uncontrived, but as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon orderly and duly fitted and prepared for ſuch a relation, partly by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Humane Nature, or a body of fleſh, partly by ſuffering Death, the Death of the Croſs, in this body, and by his riſing again from the dead. For by ſuffering Death, eſpecially the Death of the Croſs, in the Humane Nature, 1. He <hi>made Peace</hi> (as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it in the latter of the Paſſages) <hi>i. e.</hi> He did that which was proper and effectual to <hi>reconcile</hi> Men unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and conſequently unto Angels alſo, who were an enmity with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe of their enmity againſt God, yea and unto, and amongſt, themſelves alſo. The Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Humane Nature, was upon this account, a proper means to <hi>reconcile</hi> Men unto God, [<hi>i. e.</hi> to cauſe Men to think ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily and reverently of him, to love him, delight in him, &amp;c. who by reaſon of the guilt of ſin cleaving to them, were apt before to hate him, as Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors do their Judg,] <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe God, the ſins of Men being perfectly expiated and attoned thereby, freely offereth them, and upon their Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, aſſureth them, the Pardon and Forgiveneſs of their Sins. See to this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. largely opened by us formerly <note n="u" place="margin">Cap. 5. Sect. 28, 29, &amp;c.</note>. So then, the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> being a proper means (as hath been ſhewed) for the <hi>reconciling</hi> of Men unto God, it muſt needs be a means ſemblably, and by way of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of reconciling them unto Angels alſo, who had no other quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but onely for their hatred, and enmity againſt God. Now this Reconciliation between Men, and Angels, when actually effected, putteth them into a capacity of being fellow-members in one and the ſame body, and ſo of uniting mutually under one and the ſame Head. For as <hi>two cannot walk together, except they be agreed;</hi> ſo neither can a plurality of Perſons kindly, and to the contentment, either of themſelves mutually, or of their Head, incorporate into one and the ſame community, or walk in ſubjection under the ſame Head. In which reſpect, the reconcilement of Men alſo, to, and amongſt themſelves, as <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Jews</hi> unto <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> unto <hi>Jews,</hi> who through diverſity of Religions, Opinions, and outward Forms of worſhiping God, were at enmity the one againſt the other (and there is the ſame reaſon of other men diſtanced in affection, whether upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, or otherwile) was as neceſſary as that of Men unto Angels, in order to the accompliſhment of the ſaid great Deſign of God. Now Chriſt by His Death, and by the general Promulgation of the Goſpel throughout the World, which depended thereon, and was a fruit thereof, both took away the Ceremonial Obſervations of the <hi>Jews,</hi> with their Notions and Opinions hanging thereon, as alſo the Idolatrous and Superſtitious Rites and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> with ſuch conceits as they built hereon, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made (as it were) a double <hi>partition wall</hi> between them; thus endevor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an high Hand of Grace, to reduce both the one and the other of them, into one and the ſame way of worſhipping God, <hi>viz.</hi> that preſcribed in the Goſpel; as alſo both to think, and ſpeak the ſame things concerning God, and ſo to cauſe the enmity and alienation of minde between them, to ceaſe, that by this means they might be prepared and fit to make, as fellow-members,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:94900:238"/> one body. See the Apoſtles Diſcourſe to this point, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. The ſame or the like courſe, he hath taken alſo by his Death, and the Publication of His Goſpel thereupon, to reconcile all other Perſons of Mankinde among themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> by calling them into communion in one Spirit, in one Faith, in one Hope, in one Baptiſm, in one God, in one Saviour, &amp;c. that ſo there might be no occaſion of any ſuch differences, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtes between them, but that they might be every ways meet to aſſociate in one and the ſame ſpiritual Body, and live ſweetly together under one and the ſame Head, <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> This then is one conſideration, wherein the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was neceſſary for the bringing about the glorious Projection of God, I mean, the <hi>gathering of all things, whether in Heaven, or on Earth,</hi> under, or <hi>into, an Head,</hi> the ſame <hi>Head, Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did accommodate the ſame Deſign of God, in another reſpect alſo; <hi>viz.</hi> as his voluntary ſubjection hereunto was an equitable foundation, or conſideration, whereon God might, as He did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exalt Him to the the tranſcendent Honor of that Glorious Headſhip, and Principality. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, meaning, becauſe <hi>being in the form of God,</hi> an eſtate wherein <hi>He counted it no robbery,</hi> as he had no reaſon to do, <hi>to be equal with God, He made Himſelf of no reputation,—but humbled Himſelf, and became obedient unto the Death, even the Death of the Croſs;</hi> in conſideration of this wonderful Humiliation, and Condeſcenſion, ſaith he) <hi>God hath even highly exalted Him, and given him a Name above every name, &amp;c. Philip.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. Hence it is that the Scriptures ſtill mention that glorious inveſtiture of his which we ſpeak of, Headſhip over Men and Angels, as conferred upon him, not till after his riſing again from the dead.—<hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the working of His mighty Power, which He wrought in Chriſt, when He raiſed Him from the dead, and ſet Him at His right Hand in Heavenly places, Far above all Principality, and Power, and Might<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Dominion, and every name that is named, not onely in this world, but in that alſo which is to come, And hath</hi> PVT ALL THINGS UNDER HIS FEET, <hi>and</hi> GAVE <hi>Him to be the</hi> HEAD <hi>over all things to the Church, &amp;c. Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21, 22. From theſe laſt words, <hi>And hath put &amp;c.</hi> it is obſervable, that though God hath by a ſtrong hand <hi>ſubjected</hi> all things whatſoever under, and unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet He hath GIVEN <hi>Him to his Church,</hi> and to His <hi>Church</hi> onely, conſiſting of Men and Angels, (<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 10.) for an <hi>Head.</hi> From whence it follows, 1. That neither Men, nor Angels, are neceſſitated or compelled by God, to accept of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for their <hi>Head,</hi> or in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lation of an <hi>Head,</hi> though they be neceſſitated and compelled, with all other Creatures, to ſubject to his will and pleaſure in the exerciſe of his Power. For that which is properly <hi>given</hi> to a man, he is not forced to accept, or take, but receives it freely. If Men, or Angels be unwilling, or ſhall refuſe, to be, or to continue, Members of his Church, as they are at liberty to do (for their Wills in this kinde are not compell'd, or neceſſitated by God) they ſhall diſcharge themſelves, though to their infinite loſs and miſery, from their relation, or ſubjection unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as their Head. 2. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtands in the relation of an <hi>Head,</hi> and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Offices of an <hi>Head,</hi> onely unto ſuch, whether Angels, or Men, who are Members of that Body, which is called his <hi>Church.</hi> So that though the nature, and compaſs of Gods great Projection by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Death, was (as we heard the Apoſtle expreſſing it) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to <hi>head,</hi> or <hi>rehead, all things</hi> whatſoever (<hi>viz.</hi> that are headable, as we inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted) <hi>whether in Heaven, or on Earth, [i. e.</hi> all Men without exception,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:94900:238"/> and all ſtanding Angels,] yet it doth not follow from hence, that all Men without exception, ever will, or ſhall, be actually <hi>headed</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> (and ſo be ſaved by him,) becauſe many will not accept of, or ſubmit unto, thoſe terms, upon which onely the declared Will and Purpoſe of God is, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs his Creature actually in ſo great and bleſſed a Priviledg. For though Gods Purpoſe and Deſign was to <hi>head</hi> All Men without exception, with, or in, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well as <hi>all</hi> his good Angels, [<hi>i. e.</hi> ſo to give, and contrive his Chriſt, that all of both ſorts of theſe Creatures without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>xception, might be put into a capacity, and have opportunity, of being brought into the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Members under ſo glorious an <hi>Head,</hi>] yet it was no part of either, that any one particular, whether of the one kinde of creature, or of the other, ſhould actually come into this relation, otherwiſe then by a free and voluntary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for their <hi>Head.</hi> So that as the <hi>Phariſees and Lawyers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Counſel,</hi> or Projection, <hi>of God</hi> [intended by him for good unto them] in Baptiſm, <hi>againſt themſelves [i. e.</hi> to their own great damage and loſs] in refuſing to be <hi>baptized by John</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n like manner the greateſt part of Men voluntarily <hi>reject</hi> that great Counſel of God for the reducing of them under ſo infinitely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſirable an <hi>Head,</hi> as the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, to their own unconceivable miſery, by refuſing to ſubject themſelves unto him, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Members.</p>
            <p>Nor doth it follow from ſuch a rejection of that Counſel of God we ſpeak of, by Men, that therefore this Counſel of his, or his Intention in it, ſhould be fruſtrated, or made voyd: becauſe (as hath been ſaid) the tenor, frame, or import of this Counſel was, not that all Men without exception ſhould abſolutely, and without condition, be actually inveſted with the benefit or bleſſing therein intended unto Men; but that all ſuch Men without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch onely, who ſhould beleeve in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and freely ſubmit unto him as an Head, were they all without exception, or were they never ſo few, or never ſo many, ſhould actually partake of the ſaid benefit. Therefore from neither of the two Paſſages of <hi>Scripture</hi> cited towards the beginning of this Section, can any ſuch concluſion be evinced, That all men without exception ſhall firſt or laſt be ſaved by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> becauſe it cannot be evinced from either of them, that all Men without exception will beleeve in him firſt, or laſt, without which there is no Salvation ſuppoſed in either of them.</p>
            <p>That neither of the places ſpeak of any ſuch <hi>Reconcilement of all things</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, which was actually to take place in any Perſon of Man, without the intervening of Faith; nor yet again that either of them ſuppoſeth an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, that all Men, or that any Man, ſhould beleeve, ſo as to be actually and compleatly <hi>reconciled</hi> unto God, by means of the projected Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation here ſpoken of, is evident from this applicatory diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, ſubjoyned to the latter of them; <hi>And you that were ſometime alienated, and enemies in your minde by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, In the body of his fleſh through death, to preſent you holy and unblameable, and irreprovable in his ſight, If ye continue in the Faith grounded and ſetled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel. &amp;c.</hi> In this clauſe, <hi>If ye continue in the Faith ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c.</hi> he clearly ſuppoſeth, 1. That their preſent Reconciliation unto God, was obtained by the intervention of their Faith: And, 2. that the perfecting and compleating of it in Glory, did depend upon their Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in this Faith unto the end. Which latter clearly implyeth, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that Reconciliation which God made of all things to himſelf by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet they might very poſſibly not have been reconciled unto him,

            <p n="2">2. For thoſe words (in the former of the ſaid places) <hi>that in the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fulneſs of times he might gather together all &amp;c.</hi> they no ways import any ſuch time yet to come, wherein all Men ſhould be actually <hi>gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one,</hi> or be ſaved, by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but onely that God made choyce of the moſt convenient time, as <hi>viz.</hi> when many ages and generations of the World had firſt paſſed, to bring his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> into the World, to ſuffer death, and ſo to raiſe him again from the dead, and upon this to anoint him with that precious <hi>oyl of joy and gladneſs,</hi> by which he was conſecrated into the great Honor and Dignity of that Glorious Headſhip we ſpeak of, and whereof he ſtands poſſeſſed at this day; and that for this end, and with this intent on Gods part, that all Men without exception, that ſhould for the time to come be born, and live in the World, ſhould by beleeving in him, and ſubmitting to him, have the opportunity to enjoy him in the bleſſed rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Glorious Head, by whom they might be preſerved and kept in peace and bleſſedneſs for ever.</p>
            <p>If it be yet demanded, how God (in the latter of the ſaid Paſſages) may<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> be ſaid <hi>to reconcile all things [i. e.</hi> as well Angels, as Men, as we former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expounded] <hi>unto himſelf, by Chriſt,</hi> when as between him, and his Elect Angels there was no enmity, or diſtance; I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not neceſſary, upon the account of any expreſſion here uſed by the Apoſtle, to ſuppoſe that the Angels were in particular <hi>reconciled unto</hi> God by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but thoſe words, <hi>whether they be things on Earth, or things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> may be taken emphatically, and import onely ſuch a ſence as this, that as Gods Project in <hi>Chriſt</hi> was for <hi>Reconcilement,</hi> ſo was it ſo gloriouſly vaſt and comprehenſive in this kinde, that it compaſſed and took in, not onely the inferior World, the Earth, and <hi>all things therein,</hi> but even the ſuperior alſo, <hi>the Heavens</hi> themſelves, and <hi>all things herein, viz.</hi> as far as they were reconcilable, or ſtood in need of reconcilement unto him: So that in caſe there had been any diſtance, more or leſs, between God, and His Angels, the courſe which God had taken by his <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was abundantly ſufficient and proper to have healed it. When the ſame Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> in <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel,</hi> to <hi>be inſtant, in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon,</hi> he doth not ſuppoſe, or imply, that there is any time <hi>out of ſeaſon,</hi> or unſeaſonable, for the work; but the expreſſion is emphatical, and imports, that he need not be curious or ſolicitous to diſtinguiſh, between times and times, for the preaching of the Goſpel, as if there were any danger that he might preach it unſeaſonably, or at any time, or times, that were not fitting for ſuch a work; meaning, that all times were ſeaſonable for it. The two expreſſions (I conceive) do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what parallel one the other. Yet,</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a ſence, and this not altogether unproper, wherein the Angels themſelves may be looked upon as <hi>reconcilable</hi> unto God, yea and as actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconciled unto him by Chriſt. For, 1. (as <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place well obſerves) The Obedience which the Angels perform unto God, is not in every reſpect ſo compleat or abſolute, as to ſatisfie God, without a Pacifier com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between. And to this Point he citeth that of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in <hi>Job:—and his Angels he charged with folly</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Job 4. 18.</note>: He reads the words, <hi>In his Angels he will finde iniquity,</hi> [agreeable whereunto is that other ſaying of the ſame Author,

               <note n="a" place="margin">Job 15. 15.</note>,] which he is <hi>confident cannot be meant of</hi> the evil Angels, or <hi>Devils.</hi> Again, 2. He obſerveth further (and that with more unqueſtionableneſs of truth) that <hi>the Angels, being Creatures, are not out of all danger of falling,</hi> and ſo have need of <hi>confirmation by the Grace of Chriſt.</hi> From whence he concludes, that <hi>there is not ſo much Righteouſneſs in the Angels</hi> themſelves, <hi>which ſufficeth for their</hi> perfect and <hi>full conjunction with God:</hi> but that <hi>they</hi> alſo <hi>ſtand in need of a Peace-maker, by whoſe Grace they may throughly</hi> and entirely <hi>cleave unto God</hi>

               </note>. When he aſcribeth their obnoxiouſneſs to fall, unto their <hi>being Creatures,</hi> He plainly ſuppoſeth that they have no ſuch confirmation by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but that they are in a poſſibility (at leaſt) of falling, this notwithſtanding, in as much as they are <hi>Creatures</hi> ſtill, as well as they were before, or ſhould have been without this confirmation by Him; though it is true, their condition is eminently bettered by that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of confirmation, which they have by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being hereby become out of danger, though not out of poſſibility, of falling. But this by the way. Whether the preſent Righteouſneſs or Obedience of Angels be every ways ſo abſolute, as to ſatisfie God without any further ſatisfaction from another, or no; in caſe without that confirmation, which now they have received by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they had been liable to offend God, and make Him their Enemy, but are by means thereof delivered from this danger, they may properly enough be ſaid to be <hi>reconciled</hi> unto God, by Him. For as ſuch a receipt, which is taken to prevent a diſeaſe, may be as properly called Phyſique, as that which is uſed to recover a man out of ſickneſs: in like manner I ſee no Reaſon, but that that gracious and friendly act, by which a breach, likely to happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two, is prevented, may be called an act of Reconcilement, as well as that, whereby actual enmity between them is healed.

This Expoſition differs not
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:94900:240"/> much from that of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> in Cap. 61. &amp; 62. <hi>Enchirid. ad Laurentium.</hi> By what hath been argued upon the two Paſſages, it appears (I preſume) ſufficiently, that there is nothing to be found in either of them, from which the Salvation of all Men, can with any colour of Reaſon be concluded.</p>
            <p>Much leſs can any ſuch Concluſion be regularly drawn from that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, thou ſhalt by no means come out thence</hi> [meaning, out of the <hi>priſon</hi> of Hell] <hi>till thou haſt payd the uttermoſt farthing</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Matt: 5. 26.</note>. For threatening men that they ſhall not <hi>come out</hi> of Hell, <hi>till they have payd &amp;c.</hi> He no ways ſuppoſeth, that in proceſs of time they will ſuffer to the <hi>uttermoſt</hi> of what they have deſerved in Puniſhment by ſinning againſt God, and that then God will deliver them. The emphaſis of the expreſſion rather carryeth a ſence of a contrary import, <hi>viz.</hi> that they muſt never expect to come out from this Priſon, in as much as they will never be able to <hi>pay</hi> in Puniſhment, what they owe to the juſt ſeverity of God for ſinning againſt him, eſpecially after ſuch a rate, as they have done. For they are onely obdurate and finally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> impenitent ſinners that are caſt into this <hi>Priſon.</hi> A Promiſe of receiving any thing, being made, or implyed, upon the performance of an unpoſſible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is equivalent to a threatening that a man ſhall never receive it. When God expreſſeth himſelf thus to <hi>Jeruſalem, When thy ſiſter Sodom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and her daughters ſhall return to their former eſtate, and Samaria and her daughters ſhall return to their former eſtate, then thou and thy daughters ſhall return to your former eſtate</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ezek. 16. 55.</note>, He rather threateneth this City with a <hi>non-returning to her former eſtate,</hi> then promiſeth any ſuch thing to her. So in caſe our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhould promiſe unto thoſe, that are caſt into the Priſon of Hell for the debt of their ſins, that when they have payd the full debt, they ſhall be releaſed, and come forth, it would rather have the import and force of a threatening, that they ſhould never be releaſed, then of a Promiſe of releaſement after any time whatſoever. Yea ſuch Promiſes as theſe are more emphatically intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, or threatening, them plain and formal Threatenings themſelves. The Reaſon is, becauſe a plain and bare Threatening, onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mports the Purpoſe of Him that threateneth, to bring the evil mentioned in the Threatening, upon the Perſon threatned; whereas ſuch Promiſes as we ſpeak of, wherein deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from evil is promiſed upon the performance of an impoſſible Condition, the reaſon or cauſe why the evil threatened ſhould be executed or inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Perſon threatned, commonly is implyed. As when our Saviour promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth (for the words in hand have a kinde of Promiſſory import) that they, who are caſt into Hell, ſhall <hi>come forth,</hi> when they <hi>have payd</hi> the <hi>uttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, [i. e.</hi> diſcharged the full debt,] he plainly intimates the reaſon, or cauſe, why they ſhal never come forth out of this Priſon, to be, becauſe they will never make ſuch Payment. Now a Threatening upon an equitable and juſt ground for the execution of it, is much more piercing and convincing, then when it is ſimply, and without any mention, or intimation, of ſuch a ground, denounced.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded, But why ſhould not men, who are caſt into Hell for<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> ſin, be able, in continuance of time, to pay the <hi>uttermoſt farthing,</hi> and ſo be delivered from thence at the laſt? Or how can it ſtand with the Juſtice or Equity of Gods Proceedings againſt Men for ſin, to inflict everlaſting Puniſhments upon them, for ſinning onely for a ſhort time? I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sin, eſpecially ſuch ſin, for which men are ſent to Hell, being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, or baſe affront<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> offered to an infinite Majeſty and Goodneſs, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of it muſt needs be great, and indeed unconceivable. The reviling of a Magiſtrate, or the ſmiting of a Prince in the face, are miſdemeanors of an
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:94900:240"/> higher nature, and juſtly more puniſhable by men, then the like injuries done to meaner men. Yea it is the ſence of all men, that the greater the Perſon is in Dignity, eſpecially when His worth and merit is every ways anſwerable, to whom an injury or indignity is offered, the greater proportionably is the offence committed, and obligatory to the greater Puniſhment. When the ſtanders by ſaid to <hi>Paul, Revileſt thou Gods High Prieſt</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Acts 23. 3.</note>? they clearly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that the ſin of <hi>reviling</hi> a Perſon inveſted with ſo great a Dignity as the High-Prieſthood, was ſignally demeritorious, and deſerving exemplary Puniſhment. Now then allowing proportionably for the incomprehenſible and endleſs Dignity, Soveraignty, Majeſty of God, all in conjunction with eminency of worth and goodneſs every ways commenſurable to them, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury which men offer unto Him by voluntary ſinning againſt Him, and His Laws, plainly appears to be of infinite demerit, and ſo binding over the ſinner to an infinite Puniſhment; infinite I mean, either intenſively, in reſpect of the nature, or quality; or extenſively, in reſpect of the duration of it. Now the Creature not being capable of ſuffering Puniſhment infinite in the former conſideration, the juſt ſeverity of God impoſeth upon Him that, which is infinite in the latter. To ſpeak, or think, ſlightly or lightly of the guilt or demerit of ſin, or to look upon the Puniſhment of Hell fire as exceeding the proportion thereof, proceedeth either from a profound ignorance of the Nature, Majeſty, infinite Goodneſs and Sweetneſs of God, or elſe from a profane neglect of an intenſe and due conſideration of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The infinite Purity of the Divine Nature, and moſt perfect Hatred of ſin ruling and reigning therein, may well be conceived little leſs then to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate Him, 1. To the denunciation and threatening of that moſt ſevere Puniſhment we ſpeak of, for the reſtraint and prevention of it; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the execution hereof, when the ſinner ſhall deſpiſe His Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and neglect to waſh himſelf in that <hi>Fountain,</hi> which He hath moſt graciouſly opened <hi>for ſin and uncleanneſs [i. e.</hi> for men to purifie and waſh themſelves in, from the defilement of ſin, and whatſoever polluteth] unto the World. In what degree the Nature of a Man abhorreth any thing, and apprehendeth a contrariety in it, either to its Being, or well-being, He riſeth proportionably in His care, and uſe of means, for the prevention of it. The Devil (it ſeems) had made obſervation of this Principle in Men, when He ſaid, <hi>Skin for skin</hi> [or rather, <hi>skin,</hi> after <hi>skin] yea all that a man hath will he give for his life</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Job 2. 4.</note>. Death being (as <hi>Bildad</hi> ſtileth him) <hi>the King of Terrors</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Iob 18. 14.</note>, [<hi>i. e.</hi> a thing which men generally are more afraid of, then any thing, then all things in the World beſides] engageth the generality of men proportionably to withſtand His approaches, and to do the uttermoſt they are able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves out of His Hand. Now that which Death is to Men [in Point of abhorrency] Sin is unto God: and therefore it ought not to ſeem ſtrange unto, or offend any man, that He ſhould make the ſtrongeſt and ſharpeſt bridle He could, for the reſtraint of it in the World: or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that He ſhould impoſe by Law, a Penalty as deep and dreadful as <hi>the vengeance of Eternal fire</hi> it ſelf, upon the Perpetrators of it. Any thing beneath this doth not anſwer the degree, or rather the degreeleſs Infinity of His Hatred and Abhorrency of Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſeverity of that Puniſhment of ſin, which is now under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will be found the more equitable and juſt, if we conſider on the one hand, how graciouſly and bountifully above meaſure God dealeth with men, in order to their eſcape and deliverance from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on the other hand,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:94900:241"/> how wilfully, how deſperately, and with what ſenceleſs irrationality, men muſt go to work, and act, to bring themſelves into the ſuffering of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God hath diſcovered unto men, as by a Viſion of the Noon day, the<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> great deformity, foulneſs, filthineſs, and moſt deteſtable abominableneſs of Sin. The <hi>Devil</hi> was never preſented to any mans ſight, minde, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, in any ſuch monſtrous, uncouth, horrid, affrighting form or ſhape, as Sin is exhibited to the Judgments and Conſciences of men in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath diſcovered likewiſe upon the ſame terms, that moſt viperous, violent, that moſt pernicious and keen antipathy which Sin carryeth in it againſt the Peace, Comfort, well-being, and ſoveraign Bleſſedneſs of men. Poverty, Shame, Sickneſs, Pains, Tortures and Torments in the fleſh, Death, the Grave, Putrifaction, Rottenneſs, &amp;c. are but as the hummings of a gnat, or bitings of a flea, of light and inconſiderable enmity to the Comfort and Happineſs of men, in reſpect of that moſt enormous, execrable, devouring, and confounding contrariety thereunto, which the Word of God informeth the World to be in Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As concerning thoſe accommodations to the Nature of Man, as in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Profits, or Contentments otherwiſe, by the Promiſe whereof Sin is wont to commend Her ſelf and Her ſervice to the Children of Men, and to draw them aſide into folly, God hath undertaken and engaged Himſelf, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Promiſe, partly by Oath, to confer the ſame, either formally, or emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, upon them, in ways of Righteouſneſs and of Honor, if they will be perſwaded to walk in them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In caſe Men, either through ignorance (in any degree hard to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and expelled by coming to the knowledg of the Truth) or through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, or incogitancy, ſhall be prevented with ſin, or intangled in any ſinful courſe, God hath (as it were) at the coſt and charge of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in moſt bitter Sorrows and Sufferings, reared up a golden Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar (I mean that of Repentance) for them to flee unto, and to take hold of: from whence He hath moſt magnificently promiſed never to take, or pluck, any man to deſtroy him; how unrighteous, wicked, or unworthy ſoever His ways have been.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That Law, by the obſervation and keeping whereof, Men may, and ſhall, be free from ſinning, and ſo from guilt contracted hereby, is, in all the reſpective branches and parts of it, <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>good: Holy, i. e.</hi> Honorable to thoſe that keep it: it requires nothing, no act of obedience from men, which is any ways ignoble, ſervile, baſe, or reflecting diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them. <hi>Juſt, i. e.</hi> tempered, framed, and fitted to ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which God hath planted in the Natures of Men: ſo that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing commanded in it, which either croſſeth or thwarteth any impreſſion, diſpoſition, or inclination, which is natural to them, or which God hath planted in them; or which requireth any other, any further ſtrength, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, then what God either hath actually conferred upon them, or is ready to confer, upon ſuch an application of themſelves unto Him for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereof, of which they are very capable. Laſtly, The ſaid Law, is (in all parts of it) <hi>good</hi> alſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> commodious and beneficial to the Obſervers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>David, In keeping of them there is great reward</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 19. 11.</note>. So that Sin, eſpecially ſuch ſin, or ſins, which in the end bring the vengeance of Hell fire upon them, if men be not extreamly careleſs, negligent and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, may very well be prevented.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:94900:241"/>6. God hath plainly forewarned men of that eternal Wrath and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which He is determined to bring and execute upon all Perſons, that ſhall be found finally impenitent: whereby He hath taken a very gracious and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual courſe, not onely to bring ſin, eſpecially continuance in ſin, out of credit and requeſt with the hearts of men, but to make it as the ſhadow of death unto them, the dread, and firſt-born of abhorrings to their Conſciences and Souls.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Unto all thoſe, who ſhall be found obedient unto His Laws, refraining ways of ſin and of unrighteouſneſs, He hath promiſed, and that upon ſuch terms, that men may very well come to be fully ſatisfied upon clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent grounds, of the reality and truth of theſe Promiſes, the moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, bountiful, and glorious reward, of life and immortality, and all the deſirable and great things of the world to come. By this He hath taken a like gracious and effectual courſe to exalt righteouſneſs, and ſinleſſneſs of life and converſation, in the Hearts and Souls and Conſciences of Men.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To put Himſelf into a capacity of making ſuch Promiſes as theſe, as alſo of performing and making them good, unto Men, and ſo generally of treating with them ſo graciouſly, as now He doth, about the great things of their Peace, He hath delivered up unto Death, the moſt bitter and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Death of the Croſs, His onely begotten Son, in whom His Soul great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted. Hereby He hath given all poſſible evidence and aſſurance unto men, with what height and ardency of affection and deſire He ſeeketh their Salvation and eternal Happineſs, how tranſcendently great his Love, how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der above meaſure his Compaſſions are towards them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. (And laſtly) Over and beſides all theſe gracious Adminiſtrations and expreſſions of himſelf towards them, he vouchſafeth unto them the monitory, aſsiſting, and ſtrengthening preſence of his Infinite Spirit with them, and that upon ſuch terms, that if they regard and comport with him in his firſt and lower motions, they ſhall have an advance and increaſe of ſuch his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and be ſtirred up and ſtrengthened by him <hi>mightily</hi> to oppoſe tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto ſin, to walk in paths of righteouſneſs, and generally to act in due and regular order, as to the eſcaping of the Wrath and Vengeance which is to come, ſo to the obtaining of that life and glory, which God hath promiſed to thoſe that love him. Now the conſideration of theſe Particulars (with ſome others of like import, that may be added) maketh it fully evident, That Men have, 1. All the real engagements upon them, and 2. All the moſt effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious means vouchſafed unto them, that they are capable of, to refrain from Sin, and to love and practiſe Righteouſneſs: in which regard, the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Puniſhment that can be inflicted upon them for a wilful obdurateneſs in ways of Sin, is but equitable and juſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) Concerning the pretended diſproportion between the<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> Practice of Sin, as being but for a ſhort time, and the Puniſhment of Hell fire, continuing for ever, it hath been ſufficiently attoned, and the ſeeming hardneſs thereof taken off, by the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>miſed conſiderations. The demerit of a ſin, which may be ſuddenly, and in the twinkling of an eye, committed, may be ſuch, and ſo enormous, as to deſerve Puniſhment of a long continuance. The act of Murther, is, or may be committed (almoſt) in an inſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet all men judg it but equitable that the Murtherer ſhould have his life taken from him; which, in truth and ſtrictneſs of conſideration, is a perpetual Puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perpetual deprivation of that, which is, or was, moſt dear to the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And generally the Law of retaliation, which requireth <hi>an eye for an
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:94900:242"/> eye, a tooth f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r a tooth, &amp;c.</hi> is (I ſuppoſe) judged by all men moſt reaſonable and equal. And yet this Law, in the ordinary proceſs and execution of it, inflicteth Puniſhments very diſproportionable, in reſpect of continuance, to the time wherein, or whileſt, the tranſgreſſion was in acting. A man may in an inſtant of time (well-nigh) ſtrike out the eye of another; and yet the loſs of one of his own eyes, which according to the exigency of the Law we ſpeak of, he muſt ſuffer for ſuch a miſdemeanor, would be a Puniſhment to him, whileſt he live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. When a Laborer receives his hire, or wages, for his days work, there is no proportion between the time of his labor, and the time wherein, or whileſt, he receiveth his wages: the proportion which in this caſe, is, in equity, to be conſidered, is not between the time, or continuance, of the one, and the other, but between the value, or worth, of the one and the other. A man may receive in the fourtieth part of an hour, the full value of his twelve hours labor. In like manner, the proportion, which Reaſon and Equity requireth to be obſerved between ſins and Puniſhments, conſiſteth not in an equality of time between the committing of the one, and the inflicting, or ſuffering of the other, but in an equality between the degrees of demerit, in the one, and of ſuffering, in the other. Now it hath been clearly proved, that ſuch an equality as this is to be found between ſin, which is practiſed, or committed, but within a ſhort ſpace of time (comparatively) and between the Puniſhment of Hell fire, though continuing for ever. And let me here add this; that the ſhortneſs of the time, wherein men are, and know themſelves to be, in a capacity, or poſſibility of ſinning, knowing withall that their Puniſhment for ſinning, will be ſore and endleſs, is, in juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of account, rather an aggravation, then extenuation, of the demerit of their ſinning. For of the two, it is much more irrational and unworthy of men, knowingly, and voluntarily, to bring an Eternity of moſt grievous Puniſhment upon their own heads, by ſinning for a ſhort ſpace onely, then it would be to incur the ſame miſery, upon the account of a larger time of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: as it is a point of greater folly and indiſcretion, for a man to waſte a fair Eſtate, and to bring <hi>Poverty,</hi> or Beggery, <hi>like an armed man</hi> upon him, by the vain luxury and exceſs of one day, or one hour, onely, then it would be to continue in a ſpending poſture for ten, or twenty years together, and to come to Beggery at the laſt. The Holy Ghoſt in Scripture, frequently inſinuates the irrationality of ſinning, by the conſideration of the ſhort and inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able continuance of the accommodations accruing unto men thereby. <hi>Wilt thou</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? [i. e.</hi> the Being whereof is inconſiderable, and next to that <hi>which is not,</hi> or which hath no Being at all, for the ſhort continuance of it;] <hi>for Riches certainly make themſelves wings, they fly away as an Eagle towards Heaven</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Prov. 23. 5.</note>. Now every whit as certain it is, that the fruits or contentments which accrue unto men by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways and means of ſinning, are every whit as periſhable, of as ſhort and uncertain a continuance, as <hi>riches,</hi> which are the birth, that Covetouſneſs travelleth with, and is pained to bring forth. So that all Particulars relating to the buſineſs in hand, being put to account, and truly ſummed up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, amount to this, that there is no unrighteouſneſs, or hardneſs in it at all, that God, for the ſins, which men impenitently, and with wilful obdurateneſs of heart, commit within the ſhort compaſs or ſpace of mortality, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a Puniſhment of an everlaſting continuance. Nor is this his ſeverity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin any whit the more obnoxious, or diſparageable, becauſe He Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuffers no inconvenience thereby in the leaſt, His eſtate in Bleſſedneſs
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:94900:242"/> and Glory being liable to no breach, or diſaccommodation. This rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the equity of ſuch His Proceedings againſt ſin and ſinners, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinceth, that what He doth in puniſhing the one and the other with that ſeverity of Puniſhment, which hath been oft mentioned, He doth not out of any ſpirit of revenge (properly ſo called, or as it is frequently found in men) nor out of any deſire of ſelf-reparations, but out of the moſt abſolute and perfect Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, and Purity of His Nature, in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with that moſt exquiſite, ſedate, and diſpaſſionate knowledg which he hath of the juſt demerit of ſin.</p>
            <p>Whereas, in the Explication of our Doctrine concerning <hi>Chriſts</hi> dying<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> for all Men (Sect. 1. of this Chapter) we ſignified, that Intentions, and ſo reality of intention, are not competible unto God, in all and every reſpect, wherein they are aſcribed unto men; though we have ſufficiently accounted for our ſence and meaning herein formerly <note n="m" place="margin">Cap. 3.</note>, yet we ſhall here, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſatisfaction, briefly review that account, that ſo it may clearly appear, how, and in what ſence, we affirm and hold, that God intended, or intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the Salvation of all Men, in, or by the Death of Chriſt. The actions of men (and ſo of Angels, and of any Creature whatſoever) as well imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as tranſient, inward, as outward, not being really the ſame things, with their reſpective Natures, Eſſences, or Beings, have their peculiar and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate forms really diſtinct from their ſaid Natures and Beings, ſo that they may be actually ſeparated from theſe, and yet theſe continue and remain. As for example, <hi>David</hi> once had a Purpoſe or Intention, to build God an Houſe, or Temple: but upon a diſcovery made unto Him by God, that His Will was otherwiſe, and that, not He, but his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſhould do it, His Purpoſe and Intentions that way expired, and had no longer a Being: yet <hi>David,</hi> after this Purpoſe and Intention of his were fallen, continued the ſame Perſon, for Nature and Eſſence, which He was before. Now becauſe that which we call an Intent, or Intention, in created ſubjects, as Men, hath a peculiar Nature, or form, really diſtinct (as hath been ſaid) from the ſubject and Nature thereof; and Names and words were at firſt impoſed upon things, according to what men generally knew, or apprehended to be in them, hence it is that theſe words, <hi>Intent, Intention, &amp;c.</hi> properly, and in ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between men, ſignifie ſuch an act of the Minde, or Will, of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature, which is in his Power as well to let fall and lay aſide, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or raiſe up within him; yea and which falleth and ceaſeth conſtantly and of courſe, when the thing <hi>intended</hi> is effected. Therefore in this ſtrict and formal ſignification of the word, <hi>Intentions</hi> are altogether inattributable unto God, in as much as all His Acts, and Actings, in one kinde or other, are <hi>diviſim, &amp; conjunctim,</hi> joyntly and ſeverally, one and the ſame thing with His Nature, Eſſence, and Being (as we have heretofore demonſtratively proved, and that from the expreſs Principles and conſtant aſſertions of our Adverſaries themſelves, as likewiſe from the Doctrine concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, generally received amongſt us <note n="n" place="margin">Cap. 3. Sect. 7, 8, &amp;c. Cap. 4. Sect. 5. 12, &amp;c.</note>,) and conſequently are not periſhable, or liable to any expiration, fall, or change, upon any events, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, or effectings of things whatſoever, more then Himſelf, or His ſimple Eſſence and Being. So that when with the Scriptures we aſcribe <hi>Intentions</hi> unto God, our meaning (with theirs alſo) is, that God, in, and by, that one great indeſinent, unintermittable, unconceivable Act of his, which is Himſelf, and wherein He put forth Himſelf from Eternity, and by which He gave, and gives, Being, to all Creatures, Motions, and Actings of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:94900:243"/> whatſoever ſucceſſively <note n="o" place="margin">See Cap. 4. Sect. 12, 13, 14, &amp;c. 22, &amp;c.</note>, acteth and expreſſeth Himſelf in order to the effecting, or obtaining, of ſuch ends, or things, as He is ſaid to <hi>intend,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome ſuch manner, as men do, when they <hi>intend</hi> the effecting, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of what they project, or deſire. Therefore as men, when they <hi>intend</hi> ſuch and ſuch ends, are wont to levy, and uſe means proper and likely (at leaſt in their Judgments) to effect and bring them to paſs: in like manner God is ſaid to <hi>intend</hi> ſuch and ſuch things, when He providentially acteth in due order towards, and with a ſufficient proportion of ſtrength in acting for, the effecting and procurement of them. And thus, and in this ſence, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be underſtood, when we affirm and hold, that God <hi>intendeth</hi> the Salvation of all Men without exception, in, and by, the Death of <hi>Christ; viz.</hi> that upon the account of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death, He vouchſafeth a ſufficiency of means unto all Men [conſidered as men, and before their wilful ſinning that moſt heinous and unpardonable ſin] whereby to be ſaved: ſo that if any particular Perſon, man, or woman, periſh, or be not ſaved, the cauſe, or Reaſon hereof is not any want of ſufficient means from God for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but their own voluntary neglect, or non-improvement of the means vouchſafed unto them in order thereunto; yea ſuch a neglect, which they were no ways neceſſitated unto, neither by any Decree of God, nor by any ſtrength, or ſubtilty, of temptation from the Devil, or from the World, nor yet by any weakneſs, or ſtrength of corruption in themſelves, but which they might, all theſe notwithſtanding, very well have prevented, and not have incurred the guilt, or danger of it.</p>
            <p>When in the premiſed Explication of our Doctrine, we ſay that God did<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> onely <hi>antecedently</hi> intend the actual Redemption and Salvation of all Men, in, and by, the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not <hi>conſequently;</hi> our meaning is, that He ſo far, and upon ſuch terms, intended the Salvation of all Men without exception, as to vouchſafe unto them all, ſufficient grace and means for their Salvation, not purpoſing, or intending to interpoſe by any Providence of His, either poſitive, or privative, but that every man without exception, may, or might, ſo improve or uſe, the grace and means vouchſafed unto them, as to obtain Salvation thereby; This (with the ancient Fathers <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcene</hi>) I call, His willing, or intending the Salvation of all Men, <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently.</hi> Of this Intention, or Will of God, the Apoſtle ſpeaks plainly, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 4. Who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledg of the Truth.</hi> But this <hi>antecedent</hi> Intention of His notwithſtanding, He may, and doth, intend and will likewiſe, that whoſoever ſhall not uſe the ſaid grace and means ſo graciouſly vouchſafed unto them, ſo as by them truly to repent, and beleeve, yea and perſevere thus repenting, and beleeving, unto the end, ſhould periſh everlaſtingly. So that according to this latter, this <hi>conſequent</hi> Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His, He intendeth the Salvation, onely of thoſe who ſhall beleeve, and perſevere beleeving unto the end, and the condemnation of all others: (we ſpeak now of Perſons actually capable of Faith, and Unbelief, not of Infants, who admit of a peculiar conſideration by themſelves.) This with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Authors) I call His <hi>conſequent</hi> Will, or Intention. The former of theſe is not called His <hi>Antecedent</hi> Will, or Intention, either becauſe it precedes the other in time, or in eternity, or in worth or dignity, or the like: no precedency in any of theſe kindes, hath place amongſt the Decrees, Wills, or Intentions of God, which are all equally eternal, equally honorable and worthy of him. But the reaſon of this denomination, is becauſe it is ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and cometh to paſs by divine Diſpenſation, that Grace and Means for
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:94900:243"/> the obtaining of Salvation, are always in the firſt place vouchſafed unto Men, before either Salvation be actually conferred upon any man, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, or any thing Penal (I mean, ſpiritually Penal) or any ways tending, either to obduration, or condemnation, be inflicted upon Unbeleevers, and much more before actual deſtruction is brought upon them. So that the latter of the ſaid two Wills, or Intentions in God, is therefore termed, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent,</hi> becauſe He never acteth in order to, or with any tendency towards, the condemnation, or deſtruction of men, but <hi>conſequently</hi> to, and after, ſuch gracious actings of his, which were of a ſaving tendency and import unto them, theſe being reſiſted, or rejected, by them. This Diſtinction of the Intention, or will of God, into <hi>Antecedent,</hi> and <hi>Conſequent,</hi> as it hath been now opened, is founded upon clearneſs and expreſſneſs of Scripture, in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, &amp;c. how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as an Hen gathereth Her Chickens under Her wings, and ye would not! Behold your Houſe is left unto you deſolate. For I ſay unto you, ye ſhall not ſee me henceforth, till ye ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 23, 37, 38, &amp;c.</note>. The Lord <hi>Christ,</hi> by His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Word, Spirit, Providences and Adminiſtrations of ſundry kindes, <hi>firſt</hi> endevored and ſought with much tenderneſs, and greatneſs of compaſſion, to put the <hi>Jews</hi> into an eſtate and condition of peace and ſafety, as well temporal, as ſpiritual, [<hi>viz.</hi> by attempting to bring them to Repentance, and to an holy and humble walking with their God.] So that His Intention, Will, or Deſire, of their Peace and Safety, were <hi>antecedent [i. e. antecedently</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, or put in execution] to His Intention, or Will, concerning their deſtruction; which were not expreſſed, or executed, but upon, and after thoſe gracious applications of God unto them in order to their Peace, and their rejection, and contempt of them, in thoſe words, <hi>and ye would not:</hi> in which reſpect theſe may properly be termed, <hi>Conſequent.</hi> The Scriptures abound with Paſſages of this kinde, I mean, which mention the gracious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſments of God unto men for their wealth, and ſafety, as exhibited unto them in the firſt place; and his penal inflictions upon them, afterwards, and not till their abuſe, or neglect, of the ſaid addreſſments of Grace. See upon this account, <hi>Revel. 2. 21, 22. 2 Chro. 36. 15, 16, 17. Iſai. 5. 2, 4, 5. Ezek.</hi> 16. 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. compared with Verſ. 35, 36, &amp;c. (not to mention other places, of like conſideration, without number,) all which are clear and pregnant for the juſtification of the ſaid Diſtinction of the Will of God into <hi>Antecedent,</hi> and <hi>Conſequent,</hi> according to the premiſed Explication. The <hi>Antecedent</hi> Will, or Intention, of God, is frequently in Authors (and with good propriety) termed His <hi>Primary,</hi> or <hi>Principal</hi> Intention, or Will: the other, His Secondary, or leſs Principal. That <hi>Antecedent</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of His we ſpeak of, is, in reſpect of the ſubject matter of it, or things intended, the exhibition of ſufficient means for Salvation, abſolute, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpended upon the actings and movings of the Creature: my meaning is, that a ſufficiency of Grace, and Means, for the obtaining Salvation, is always, and, without any reſpect or conſideration had, either of the merit, or demerit, worthineſs, or unworthineſs of men, vouchſafed unto them all by God. That which I call His <hi>Conſequent</hi> Will, or Intention, in this kinde, is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſubject matter thereof, or the things intended, as <hi>viz.</hi> the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of actual Salvation, and ſo the infliction of actual Condemnation, or of ſpiritual Judgments in order hereunto, ſuſpended upon the behavior of men: ſo that (for example) this Intention, or Will, of His notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:94900:244"/> Salvation is never conferred upon any man, but upon his beleeving, and continuance in beleeving unto the end; nor ſhould be conferred upon any man, in caſe no man ſhould be found ſo to beleeve. Nor is Condemnation, or Deſtruction, or any thing tending hereunto, inflicted upon any man, but upon his neglect, or abuſe of the means of Salvation exhibited unto him: nor ſhould they ever be inflicted upon any man, in caſe no man were found neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective, or abuſive of the Grace of God in the Means of Salvation vouchſafed unto them. So that the <hi>Conſequent</hi> Intention or Will of God, is of like Nature and conſideration, with the Politique Laws of men, which either aſſign rewards to thoſe that ſhall deſerve well of the State where they live, in ſuch or ſuch a way, or decree the infliction of Puniſhment upon Malefactors in ſeveral kindes. For as neither of theſe Laws, ſuppoſe any abſolute or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ive neceſſity, that there will be any either ſo deſerving, as to have right of claim to the rewards promiſed; or ſo wicked, as to incur the Puniſhments ordained by the ſaid Laws: ſo neither do the Conſequent Intentions of God ſuppoſe, a determinate neceſſity, either that there will be any, who ſhall have right to the great Reward of Salvation, intended by Him hereby unto thoſe that ſhall beleeve perſeveringly; or any, that will incur Damnation, by final Impenitency and Unbelief, although (it is true) the Scriptures o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſuppoſe, and declare, 1. That there will be ſome ſaved, by beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to the end. 2. That there will be many condemned for their final Impenitency and Unbelief. 3. (And laſtly) That all Perſons of Mankinde without exception, will either beleeve unto Salvation, or remain impenitent to Condemnation. But as the ſaid Politique Laws of Men, are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſeleſs, or impolitique, becauſe they ſuppoſe no abſolute neceſſity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there will be men found, to deſerve the Rewards propoſed in the one, or to incur the Penalties impoſed by the other, in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> much as the former ſerve to excite and ſtrengthen men to do worthily, and it's very probable that ſome will accordingly be provoked, to do worthily, by the Rewards promiſed therein; and the latter are uſeful and proper to prevent the Being of ſuch Perſons in the State, who are wont to practiſe ſuch Miſdemeanors, as are therein threatened: In like manner, though that <hi>Conſequent</hi> Will, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of God we ſpeak of, ſuppoſeth no neceſſity, either that ſome will beleeve to Salvation, or that any will remain unbeleeving and impenitent to Condemnation, yet is it, through the manifeſtation of it unto men, of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar benefit and bleſſing unto the World, becauſe in the former part of it, by means of the great recompence of Reward, Salvation, promiſed therein, it is of marvelous efficacy and force to quicken men to beleeve, yea and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue beleeving, unto the end; in the latter part of it, by means of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Puniſhment threatened therein, it is of like efficacy to awaken men out of the deep ſleep of impenitency and Unbelief.</p>
            <p>Nor do we all this while, in diſcourſing the <hi>Antecedent</hi> and <hi>Conſequent</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> Intention, or Will of God, ſuppoſe that there are two Wills, or Intentions, in God, properly ſo called (no, nor yet ſo much as one,) much leſs that there are two contrary Wills in him, the one unto the other: but Intention, and Will, are (as hath been already ſaid) aſcribed unto God in reſpect of His Adminiſtrations or Efficiencies, which have ſome kinde of likeneſs with thoſe actings, which proceed from men, when they intend, or will any thing, by vertue of ſuch their Intendments. So that to ſay that God willeth, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendeth, one thing, with one kinde of Will, or Intention, and another, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to it, or differing from it, with another kinde of Will, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:94900:244"/> amounts to no more (truly interpreted) then to this, that ſome of His Diſpenſations have a tendency towards the producing of ſuch and ſuch ends; and others, towards the producing of ſuch and ſuch other ends, either differing from them, or contrary to them. Nor doth it follow from Gods acting in order to differing, yea or contrary ends, that he is therefore divided in himſelf, or inconſiſtent with himſelf; no more then it follows, that he that mourns at one time, and upon one occaſion, and rejoyceth at another time, and upon another occaſion ſuitable to ſuch a Paſſion, or expreſſion, is inconſtant, or any ways contradictious to himſelf.</p>
            <p>For a cloſe of this Chapter, I ſhall endevor the aſſoyling of a ſpecial dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty (at leaſt as it ſeems to ſome) concerning the Intentions of God. It hath been ſaid, that <hi>God in Scripture is ſaid to purpoſe, or intend a thing, when He affordeth means that are proper and ſufficient to bring it to paſs (eſpecially if He commands them to be uſed accordingly) this being a Diſpenſation of like conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with the deportment of men, who are wont to provide a ſufficiency of means (at leaſt ſo apprehended by them) for the effecting of what they purpoſe, or intend</hi>

                  </gap>
               </note>. Upon this Explication of Intentions in God, this Queſtion is moved, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the purport hereof, it may not be ſaid that He intended the offering up of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by death; becauſe, 1. By His Providence He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>Abraham</hi> with all things ſufficient and neceſſary hereunto: And 2. gave an expreſs Command unto him, that he ſhould offer him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Now if he did not intend the oblation we ſpeak of, which by his Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of it by an Angel, before it was performed, and by means whereof it never came to be performed, he ſeemed not to have done, then cannot the ſaid Explication ſtand; nor are the Intentions of God to be judged of by his vouchſafement of means proper for the production of an effect, no not though he commands them to be uſed in order thereunto. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Intention of God, in commanding <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> having otherwiſe furniſhed him with means ſufficient hereunto, was a through Tryal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Love and Faith, not the actual offering up of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by death. This is evident from <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 22. 1. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 17, &amp;c. compared.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In order to the accompliſhment of this his Intention, He commands <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>take His Son, His onely Son Iſaac, whom He loved, and to offer Him for a burnt offering</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 22. 2.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Command of God unto <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning the offering of his Son, is none otherwiſe, nor in any other ſence, to be underſtood, as direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God unto him, then as <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience, or diſobedience to it, was, or might be, a ſufficient Tryal, either of the ſoundneſs, or unſoundneſs, of his Faith and Love towards God. So then,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſoundneſs and ſincerity of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith and Love, being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently tryed and diſcovered by a diſcovery of his readineſs and willingneſs to obey the ſaid Command of God, and to offer up his Son, and this diſcovery being ſufficiently made by that which <hi>Abraham</hi> did, towards the offering up of his Son by death (though he was not actually thus offered by him) it roundly follows, that the meaning of the Command given unto <hi>Abraham</hi> in the caſe in hand, was not that He ſhould actually offer up his Son by death, but that he ſhould proceed ſo far towards the offering him up in that manner, until his willingneſs thereunto were ſufficiently manifeſted, and himſelf (God, I mean) take him off, and ſtay his hand, from acting further herein. Such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:94900:245"/> ſtructions, or forms of ſpeech, wherein the <hi>Conſequent</hi> is put for the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> and ſo again, where the end, or effect is named, to ſignifie the means proper for the procurement of either, are familiar and frequent with the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures. An inſtance of the former we have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 26. in this clauſe, <hi>They that ſeek the Lord, ſhall praiſe Him; i. e.</hi> they ſhall be graciouſly entreated by him, and receive good from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hereby be occaſioned or provoked to <hi>praiſe</hi> him. So <hi>Deut. 10. 17. taking rewards,</hi> is put for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unjuſtly, which commonly follows upon <hi>taking rewards.</hi> So again, to <hi>make the firſt-born,</hi> ſignifies the conferring of the inheritance, or a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon a Perſon, this being an uſual conſequent of Primogeniture, to carry the inheritance, or a double portion: <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 16. So to <hi>be wicked, or vile,</hi> ſignifies to be, guilty, or liable to Puniſhment: 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 21. guilt, or obnoxiouſneſs unto Puniſhment, being a conſequent of wickedneſs. (To paſs by many other places of like conſtruction.) Inſtances of the latter, are frequent alſo. Thus, <hi>Salvation,</hi> is put for the Scriptures, or knowledg of God, as being the means of <hi>Salvation: Joh. 4. 22. For Salvation is of the Jews.</hi> Upon a like account, <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth men to <hi>count the long-ſuffering of the Lord</hi> towards them, <hi>Salvation; i. e.</hi> a means of <hi>Salvation: 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 15. See more places of like character: <hi>Rom. 14. 20. 1 Tim. 4. 16. Deut.</hi> 13. 5. (according to the Original, &amp;c.) According to either of theſe conſtructions, the Command of God unto <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>offer up His Son Iſaac for a burnt offering,</hi> may import onely a doing of ſuch things, which were precedane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly neceſſary to an <hi>offering Him up</hi> after ſuch a manner, as <hi>viz.</hi> to provide wood and fire for the burning of him, a knife, for the ſlaying of him, a coard, or the like, wherewith to binde him, an Altar, on which to lay him; and ſo again, actually to lay the wood provided upon the Altar, for the burning of him, actually to binde him, to take the knife into his hand, to ſtretch forth his hand with the knife in it with an intent to ſlay him. All theſe things with the like, being requiſite to the actual offering up of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by death, might well be ſignified, and doubtleſs were ſignified, yea and were all that was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or meant, by that Command of God (ſo oft mentioned) unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> concerning the offering up his Son. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Look what God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to do, about the offering up of his Son, that he really intended he ſhould do, yea and <hi>Abraham</hi> did it accordingly. He commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his Son: and in ſuch a ſence as he commanded, <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed, the Scripture teſtifying thus of him, in theſe words: <hi>By Faith Abraham when He was tryed, offered up Iſaac: and He that had received the Promiſes, offered up His onely begotten Son</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="margin">Hebr. 11. 17.</note>. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> no other kinde of offering up <hi>Iſaac<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> then that which <hi>Abraham</hi> performed, and what himſelf really intended that he ſhould perform. Whether <hi>Abraham</hi> at firſt underſtood the Command of God in ſuch a ſence as that, wherein we have now interpreted it, is not material. By that inhibition which was ſerved upon him by the Angel, to ſurceaſe all further Proceedings in, and about the offering up of his Son by death, before he was thus offered, he clearly enough underſtood that to have been the ſence and minde of God in the ſaid Command, which we have aſſerted. So that,</p>

(And laſtly) It is a clear caſe, that the Explication and account, given formerly in this Treatiſe, concerning the Intentions of God, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Ground and Reaſon, why Intentions are attributed unto Him, is no ways incumbred or diſabled by the Inſtance of Gods Command given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:94900:245"/> 
               <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning the offering up of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Iſaac's</hi> non-oblation by death. There is nothing in this Example, to prove, that God doth at any time vouchſafe means competent and proper for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing to paſs, eſpecially when he commands that theſe means be uſed accordingly, but that he truly and really intends (as he is capable of intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing) the coming to paſs thereof.</p>
            <p>Nor can it here (with any face of Reaſon) be replyed, that, by ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as we have put upon the words of God in His Command unto <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning the offering up of his Son, when He vouchſafeth means of Salvation unto Men, and commandeth them to uſe them accordingly, it cannot be concluded from thence, that therefore He really intendeth the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Men, but onely that they ſhould uſe the ſaid Means to obtain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Becauſe, though God, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> caſe, did in His Intentions, ſeparate the Means of offering up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> from the actual Oblation of Him, this not being the end of His Command given unto Him (as was ſaid,) yet He did not ſeparate between the ſaid Means, and that which was His true end in the Command, which was the Tryal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, and for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting whereof the ſaid Command, and all that which was meant thereby, was as natural and proper a means, as it was for the actual oblation of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by death. In like manner when He vouchſafeth Means of Salvation unto Men, and commandeth the uſe of them accordingly, He cannot be ſuppoſed to divide or ſeparate, in His Intentions, between the uſe of theſe Means, and their proper end, Salvation; there being no other end proper to be effected by the uſe of the Means of Salvation, but Salvation it ſelf, or at leaſt none, but in conjunction with Salvation. And certain it is, that there is no man of wiſdom, who intends the uſe of ſuch Means, which are determinately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to the production of one end, and no more, or however, of no more, but onely by, and through, the production of that one, but that He intends the production of this end peculiarly. How God may intend the Salvation of Men, and yet Men never come to be ſaved, hath been already explained <note n="t" place="margin">Cap. 3. Sect. 7, 17.</note>, and that (as I remember) more then once; and may be yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opened, upon occaſion.</p>

               <p>Exhibiteth ſeveral Grounds and Reaſons, whereby the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality of Redemption by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or Christs dying for All Men, without Exception, is Demonstratively evicted.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ALthough Scripture-Authority be greater then all Demonſtration other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> for the Eviction and Confirmation of any Doctrine or Tenet in matter of Religion, as ſimply and in it ſelf, ſo alſo with thoſe, whoſe Faith mainly or ſolely beareth upon the foundations of the Scriptures, yet have Arguments and Grounds of Reaſon, if they be pregnant and clear, a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable influence upon the Judgments and Conſciences of Men, when they are levyed and drawn up in the nature of Seconds, or Aſſiſtants, to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and plead the ſame cauſe with them. For when a Doctrine, or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is held forth as the Minde of God in the Scriptures, and Scripture-Authority produced and inſiſted upon, either ſingly, or in conſort, for the proof thereof; in caſe this Doctrine ſhall be found to have a fair and clear
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:94900:246"/> conſiſtence with the unqueſtionable Principles of ſound Reaſon, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no place in the Conſciences of Men for fear or jealouſie, concerning the Truth thereof. God Himſelf being the Author of thoſe noble endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Men, Reaſon and Underſtanding, muſt needs be conceived the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor alſo of whatſoever truly conſorteth with them. But in caſe the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures ſhall be urged and preſſed upon the Conſciences of Men in defence of ſuch a Doctrine, which grates, or bears hard upon the common and clear Dictates of that Light, which God hath planted in the Souls of Men, it is unpoſſible but that a conſidering Man ſhould much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſuch a ſence or interpretation, which is put upon the Scriptures in ſuch a caſe. The Reaſon hereof hath been given elſewhere <note n="a" place="margin">Epiſt. to the Reader.</note>. The Premiſſes conſidered, I judg it a matter of ſignal conſequence in order to the ſecuring the Judgments and Conſciences of Men about the truth of the main Doctrine maintained in this Diſcourſe, to demonſtrate the perfect and clear conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of it with Grounds of Reaſon, though ſubſtantially proved already from the Scriptures, yea and ſatisfactorily alſo (I truſt) unto thoſe, who ſo underſtand the Scriptures, as not to make either the Wiſdom, or Juſtice of God Sufferers by them. My Reaſons then for the Univerſality of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in reference unto Men, are theſe following.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Chriſt dyed not for all Men without exception</hi> (in the ſence formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared)<note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>Argum. 1.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>then is that Great Covenant of Grace, which God hath made with the World, and ratified in His Blood, made with unknown Perſons, and ſuch who are no ways expreſt in this Covenant, neither by Name, nor by any other Character, or qualification, by which they may, at leaſt, for a long time, be known, or diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this Great Covenant we ſpeak of is not ſtruck, or made with unknown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I mean with ſuch, who for a long time, if ever, neither can tell themſelves whether they be the Covenanted ones, or no, nor are capable of any reaſonable infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hereof by others. Therefore Chriſt dyed for all men, without exception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon of the former Propoſition, and the Conſequence therein, is this: becauſe the Elect (ſo called in the common Notion of Election) with whom onely this Covenant of Grace is pretended to be made, and for whom onely Chriſt is ſuppoſed to have dyed, are Perſons no ways diſtinguiſhable from others, neither before, at all, and very hardly (if at all) after their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Converſion unto God. That they are not at all diſcernable from others, before Converſion, is evident from ſeveral places. <hi>For we our ſelves</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> meaning, who are now ſo much altered and changed by a work of Grace and Regeneration in us) <hi>were ſometimes [viz.</hi> before our Converſion] <hi>fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Tit. 3. 3.</note>. Certainly theſe are no appropriate, or diſtinguiſhing characters of the Elect, but ſuch, which do evidently prove the Elect (in the common ſignification of the word) before Converſion, and the Non-Elect, to be indiſcernable the one from the other, as well by themſelves, as by others. We ſhall not need to cite any more places for the proof of this. You may peruſe the ſecond Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> at your leaſure, which ſpeaks, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt throughout, to this Point. Again,</p>
            <p>2. That after Regeneration it ſelf, the Elect (ſo called) are very hardly, if at all, diſcernable, either to themſelves, or others, from Hypocrites, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoſe that ſhall periſh, is no leſs evident neither. Firſt, That they are not at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll diſcernable from Hypocrites, in reſpect of others, at leaſt for a time, and many times for a long time, will (I ſuppoſe) readily be acknowledged. The
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:94900:246"/> Apoſtles did not know <hi>Judas</hi> to be an Hypocrite or a Traytor, no not after long acquaintance &amp; converſe with him. For then they would not have ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every man himſelf, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> told them, that there was <hi>one of them that would betray Him.</hi> Nor did <hi>Philip</hi> know <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to be in the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and bands of iniquity, when he Baptized him: nor <hi>Paul, Demas,</hi> whileſt he made him his Companion. And how ſhould others infallibly know who are Elect, and ſhall be ſaved, when as the Lord Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>many that are firſt, ſhall be laſt; i. e.</hi> many that for a time march in the Head of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and make a ſhew of more zeal and forwardneſs in the ways of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then other men, yet wheel off again to the World, and become like <hi>Salt which hath loſt the ſavor, and is good for nothing, but to be thrown upon the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil, and troden under foot by men.</hi> Again, 2. That ſuch Perſons as we ſpeak of, the Elect, I mean ſuch, who ſhall actually be ſaved, (at leaſt a great part of them) are not able always, no nor ordinarily, after the work of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in them, to diſtinguiſh, or diſcern themſelves, from thoſe who ſhall periſh, is abundantly confirmed, partly by the continual fears, jealouſies, and doubtings of their ſpiritual Condition, wherewith many of them are exerciſed even to their dying day; partly alſo by thoſe great and good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they have of others, as being worthy and ſound Chriſtians, who yet afterwards, <hi>turn back with the dog unto their vomit, and with the ſwine that hath been waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> So that the Truth of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Propoſition is unqueſtionable: <hi>viz.</hi> That if Chriſt dyed not for all Men, without exception, but for the Elect onely, then is the Covenant of Grace in His Blood, made with unknown Perſons, ſuch who neither can certainly ſay of themſelves, nor any for them, that they are the Covenanted ones.</p>
            <p>As to the Minor Propoſition, the truth hereof is evident alſo. The Tenor of it, was this; That <hi>the Covenant of Grace is not ſtruck, or made, with unknown Perſons,</hi> or ſuch, concerning whom it is either impoſſible, or next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, to know plainly, and certainly, who they are. It is contrary to the nature, and intent of a Covenant, eſpecially of a Covenant of Grace, that the parties intereſſed in it, and whom the Covenant concerns and relates unto, ſhould not be diſcernable or known from all other Perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; or that it ſhould miniſter any occaſion of controverſie, or debate, who theſe Perſons ſhould be. Look into all Covenants that are drawn up, and made, between man, and man, and you ſhall finde, for the moſt part, the Names of the Covenanted, as well as of the Covenanters, expreſſed in them; or howſoever, if all their Names be not expreſſed, yet are they ſufficiently declared otherwiſe, as <hi>viz.</hi> by ſuch and ſuch characters, relations, or the like, whereby they may be as plainly known, as if their Names themſelves were mentioned. As for example, When one man Covenanteth with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is named in the Covenant, and with his Heirs, Executors, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators, or Aſſigns; theſe words of relation do as plainly and clearly point out the Perſons intended and meant, as if they had been expreſſed by their Names. Yea (doubtleſs) the Reaſon why theſe Perſons are uſually expreſſed by ſuch terms of Relation, and not by their Names, in Covenants between men, is, becauſe neither of the Covenanting Parties, at the time of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Covenant, knew, or were able to call them by, their Names; which cannot be ſaid of God, in His Covenant of Grace, in as much as all Mens Names were known unto Him, when He made this Covenant with the World. Look into the Scriptures; in all the Covenants ſpecified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded here, you will finde the Perſons Covenanted with, either named, or
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:94900:247"/> elſe ſo deſcribed, that there is no place left for any doubt who they be. When <hi>Caleb</hi> made this Covenant, proffered theſe terms: <hi>He that ſmiteth Kiriath-Sepher, and taketh it, to Him will I give Achſah my daughter to wife;</hi> it is, and<note place="margin">Ioſh. 15. 16.</note> was, eaſie enough to conceive, who they were, with whom this Covenant was made, <hi>viz.</hi> all the People, or Men, that were with Him, expreſſed in that Pronoun, <hi>He;</hi> which in the dialect of the Scripture, hath the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and force, of the univerſal Particle, <hi>Whoſoever;</hi> As, <hi>He that beleeveth, i. e.</hi> whoſoever beleeveth, <hi>ſhall be ſaved: Mark</hi> 16. So in that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Joh. 6. Him that cometh unto me, i. e.</hi> whoſoever cometh unto me, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt out:</hi> with many the like. A like Covenant, or offer of Grace, it ſeems that <hi>Saul</hi> alſo made, upon occaſion of the affront which the Gyant-like <hi>Philiſtim, Goliah,</hi> put upon Him, and His whole Army. <hi>And it ſhall be, that the Man who killeth Him, the King will enrich Him with great riches, and will give Him His Daughter, and make His Fathers Houſe free in Iſrael</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 15</note>. It is evident likewiſe in this Covenant, who the Perſons were, that were Covenanted with upon the terms mentioned; <hi>viz.</hi> all the Perſons without exception in <hi>Sauls</hi> Army. I chuſe rather to give inſtance in ſuch Covenants as theſe, becauſe they are of the ſame form, and tenor, <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis mutandis</hi> (as Lawyers uſe to ſay) with the Covenant of Grace it ſelf, which is founded in the Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But the like is every whit as apparant in other Covenants alſo; as you may pleaſe to conſider at your leaſure.</p>
            <p>Again, 2. If we weigh the end, or intent of a Covenant, we ſhall clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde, that this requires a determinate and clear knowledg, or a diſtinct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of the Parties Covenanting, or Covenanted with. The principal and main end, or intent, of a Covenant, is, to inſure unto the Party, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Covenanted with, ſuch and ſuch terms, or things, as are ſpecified in the Covenant, according to the Tenor and Conditions thereof. Mark; The end of a Covenant, is not the ſimple collation, or donation of any thing, to a Perſon, one or more; but the ſecuring, or inſuring Perſons, that ſuch and ſuch things ſhall be given unto them, or conferred upon them, upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch and ſuch Conditions, as the Covenant ſpecifies. And this clearly, and without controverſie, is the end (I mean, the proper and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate end; for there are ſeveral ends beſides this,) of the Covenant of Grace, eſtabliſhed in the Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt; viz.</hi> to give Aſſurance unto the Sons and Daughters of Men, that upon their Faith and Repentance, and their Perſeverance in both unto the end, they ſhall have Salvation and Eternal Life conferred upon them. If ſo be a man hath an abſolute, unlimited, and right-out Purpoſe or Intent to confer ſuch, or ſuch things upon men, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is but an unſavory and ſuperfluous thing: becauſe a man may confer or give what he pleaſeth to another, without it. So if God had a ſimple and abſolute Intention to confer the Great things of Heaven upon Men (I mean, without the performance of ſuch and ſuch Articles, or Conditions as we ſpeak of) the making of a Covenant with them had been in vain. Therefore the proper end of a Covenant, is to aſſure, or to ſecure thoſe, that are Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with, that upon the performance of the Articles of the Covenant, the good things mentioned therein (if it be a Covenant of Good things) ſhall be exhibited and given unto them. Now then this being the end of a Covenant, if the Perſons intereſſed and concerned in it, or Covenanted with, ſhould not be known who they are, they cannot partake of this end, nor be any whit the better, or more ſecure in their mindes touching the enjoyment of the good
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:94900:247"/> things mentioned in the Covenant, upon any performance whatſoever: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the good things mentioned in a Covenant, cannot be claimed, or expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any, but onely by the Perſons Covenanted with; though they ſhould perform the terms, or conditions ſpecified in the Covenant, ten times over. <hi>If the Trumpet</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall prepare</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Himſelf to the Battel?</hi> In like manner if the Covenant of Grace ſpeaks unto Perſons unknown, both to themſelves and others, and holds forth Life and Salvation onely unto ſuch, both men, and women, as no man can ſay, or tell who they be, how ſhall any man, or woman, be excited, provoked, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, either by the tender of the Covenant unto them, or by the great and excellent things therein promiſed (conditionally) to <hi>take hold of the Covenant</hi> (as the Scripture ſpeaketh,) <hi>i. e.</hi> to perform the Conditions therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired?</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, Yes, the Covenant is to be preached, and tendered unto all,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> without exception of any: and aſſurance is therein given unto all, that upon performance of what is there required, the good things there promiſed ſhall be given unto them. So that there is ground and encouragement enough how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, for every man and woman, without exception, to beleeve. To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>It is true, the Covenant is to be preached and tendered unto all, without exception; and there is ground and encouragement enough for every man without exception, to beleeve: but both theſe clearly ſuppoſe, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is made with all Men, without exception of any; and conſequently that the Death or Blood of Chriſt, which is the ground work and foundation of this Covenant, extendeth unto all. No Covenant offereth any thing, inſureth any thing, upon what terms ſoever, but onely unto thoſe that are Covenanted with, and comprehended in the Covenant. When a man covenanteth with ſuch or ſuch a work-man, to give him ſo much, or ſo much, as ſuppoſe five or ten ſhillings by the day, this Covenant doth not binde him to give the like wages to another. What is the reaſon why the Covenant of Grace, or the Goſpel, doth not offer, or inſure Grace and Salvation to the Devils, as well as to all manner of men whatſoever, upon their beleeving? Doubtleſs becauſe the Devils are not within the number of the Covenanted ones, nor of thoſe, unto whom Grace and Mercy were intended upon the terms of the Goſpel: and this becauſe the Death of Chriſt, which is the ground of the Covenant, doth not in the attoning vertue of it reach unto them; the ſphere of whoſe activity (in this kinde) is limited and bounded by the Will and Pleaſure of God. And certainly, if Reprobates (ſo called, amongſt men) I mean ſuch who <hi>in fine</hi> periſh everlaſtingly, had no more intereſt then the Devils have, in the Death of Chriſt, there were no more ground or reaſon, why the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or the Grace thereof ſhould be more preached unto them, then to the Devils: nay there were leſs reaſon, of the two, why it ſhould be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, then why it ſhould be preached to the Devils (at leaſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Principles of that Opinion, which we oppoſe) becauſe, if preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Devils, though it did them no good, it would do them no harm, it would not increaſe their condemnation; whereas the preaching it to ſuch men as we ſpeak of, can onely encreaſe their miſery and torment. This for our firſt Argument. If Chriſt dyed not for all, then is the Covenant in his Blood made but with ſome men, and theſe altogether unknown even to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which (as hath been ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wed) is contrary to the nature, end, and ſcope of a Covenant.</p>
            <pb n="458" facs="tcp:94900:248"/>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble the Reader with that impertinent Objection, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth Notion, of Chriſt being the onely Perſon, with whom the Covenant is made. What other Covenant ſoever may be found to have been made by God with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> certainly that Covenant we ſpeak of, <hi>viz.</hi> wherein Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins, and Deliverance from the Wrath to come, are promiſed upon Repentance and beleeving in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was not made with Chriſt himſelf. God never ſaid unto Chriſt, Repent, and beleeve, and thou ſhalt have thy ſins forgiven, and be ſaved. Therefore the Covenant made with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if any ſuch thing be, or were, is altogether irrelative to our preſent Argument. Nor doth that of the Apoſtle <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 16. prove that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in a perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, is the onely Perſon, or (indeed) any perſon at all, with whom the Evangelical Covenant is made. The Tenor of the place is this. <hi>Now to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and his ſeed were the Promiſes made. He ſaith not, and to ſeeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt.</hi> Firſt, It is evident from this place, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not the onely Perſon, to whom the Promiſes here ſpoken of, are made; becauſe they are expreſly ſaid to be made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as well as to <hi>Chriſt. Now</hi> TO ABRAHAM <hi>and His ſeed were the Promiſes made, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, 2. The word, <hi>Chriſt</hi> (in the latter clauſe) is to be taken <hi>Metonymically,</hi> for thoſe who ſpiritually deſcend from him, and are born of him by Faith; in ſuch a ſence as the words, <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> frequently ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſeed, or poſterity, <hi>i. e.</hi> the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Old Teſtament. In ſuch a ſence the ſame word alſo, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is to be underſtood, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 12. For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that one body, being many, are one body: ſo alſo is Chriſt: i. e.</hi> ſo alſo is it with Beleevers, who in reſpect of their ſpiritual Being, are from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> meaning, that though they be many perſonally diſtinct, yet they make one ſpiritual, or myſtical body with <hi>Chriſt</hi> their Head. Now when <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>made to Abraham, and his</hi> ſpiritual <hi>ſeed,</hi> Beleevers; the meaning is not, as if they were ſo, or upon ſuch terms <hi>made to</hi> them, that none but they had any right to receive them, or beleeve them: for then it muſt follow, that men muſt, or ought to be Beleevers, before they receive, or beleeve the Promiſes, which is impoſſible. But <hi>the Promiſes are made to Abraham and his ſeed, i. e.</hi> the great Inheritance of Life and Salvation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by God, is promiſed, as touching the actual exhibition, or collation of it, unto Beleevers onely, ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was, and ſuch as thoſe, who deſire to be accounted his ſeed, muſt be. But this ſuppoſeth not but that the ſaid Promiſes are, in this ſence, made to <hi>Adam, and his ſeed, i. e.</hi> to all Mankinde, <hi>viz.</hi> that all and every Perſon of Mankinde, as well as <hi>Adam,</hi> yea or <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, have a right to beleeve them, ſo that in caſe they ſhould beleeve them, they ſhould do no unjuſt or unrighteous thing. Nay, they have not onely a right, but a grand neceſſity likewiſe lying upon them, to beleeve them, as well in reſpect of the Commandment of God, who commands no unjuſt or unrighteous thing, as of their own eternal Peace and Safety, whereof they will certainly make ſhipwrack, unleſs they do beleeve them.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Demonſtration, whereby Chriſt dying for all Men, is euinced,<note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>Argum. 2.</hi>
               </note> is this: <hi>If Chriſt dyed not for all Men, without exception, then He dyed for the Elect onely. But He dyed not for the Elect onely. Therefore for all M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n without exception.</hi> I preſume the former Propoſition will be granted without further Proof; becauſe they who deny that Chriſt dyed for all, generally ſuppoſe and grant, that He dyed for ſome, and by Name, for the Elect, and (indeed)
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:94900:248"/> for theſe onely. So that if it be proved, either that He dyed not for the Elect at all, or not for the Elect onely, then, according to their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and grounds, it follows, that He dyed for all. Now then, that He dyed not for the Elect, and much more not for the Elect onely, (which was the Minor Propoſition) appears thus. If the ſtate and condition of the Elect were ſuch, that Chriſt needed no more to dye for them, then He needed to dye for the Holy and Elect Angels, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed not for theſe, much leſs for theſe onely. But the ſtate and condition of the Elect was ſuch, that there was no more need that Chriſt ſhould dye for them, then for the Elect Angels. <hi>Ergo.</hi> In this Argument, I reaſon (I confeſs) upon my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries grounds, not mine own, concerning Election: but howſoever, ſuch a proceſs of arguing, as this, is very ſerviceable, for the confirmation of a Truth in oppoſition to an Error; and the Apoſtie <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſometimes<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 29</note> uſeth it in a like caſe, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29. The Major Propoſition in this laſt Argument, ſtandeth upon this ground: that there was no need that Chriſt ſhould dye for the Holy, or Elect Angels. I ſuppoſe this will not be denyed, or doubted of, by any: but however, it is clearly enough aſſerted by the Apoſtle, in that ſaying of his, <hi>Gal. 2. 21, I do not fruſtrate the Grace of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 21.</note> 
               <hi>for if Righteouſneſs (i. e.</hi> Juſtification) <hi>come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain, (i. e.</hi> without any neceſſity, or reaſonable cauſe moving thereunto.) But now, if there had been a neceſſity that Chriſt ſhould have dyed for the Elect Angels, it would not have followed, that His Death had <hi>been in vain,</hi> though men might have been juſtified by the Law. Therefore if there were no more reaſon, no more need, why Chriſt ſhould dye for the Elect of Men, then for the Elect Angels, certainly He did not dye for them, much leſs for them onely. But now that there was no more reaſon, no more need, why Chriſt ſhould dye for the Elect of Men, then for the Elect Angels, (which was the ſubſtance of the Minor Propoſition) appears by this double conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: 1. Becauſe God loved the Elect (I mean, the Elect of Men, and that as ſuch, as Elect, without any conſideration had of Chriſts dying for them) with as great a love, as He did the Elect Angels, yea with as great, as it was poſſible for him to bear to them. 2. Becauſe, Salvation and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory were decreed and adjudged to them (and conſequently were made truly and properly theirs) in, and by, Gods Purpoſe in Electing them. God in Electing them, without any conſideration or reſpect had unto Jeſus Chriſt dying, or to dye, for them, or unto their beleeving in him, did irreverſibly appropriate and conſign over unto them Eternal Life. From theſe two grounds it follows undeniably, that there was no more need for Chriſt to dye for the Elect of Mankinde, then for the Elect Angels. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If God loved the Elect of Men, with as great a love, as He loves the Elect Angels, or as He is capable of bearing towards them, what occaſion, what neceſſity was there, that Chriſt ſhould dye for the one, more then for the other? The ſame Love affords the ſame Favors, the ſame Priviledges, without any mediation to equalize it in this kinde. If God loved the Elect of Men, as much, as intenſely, as the Holy Angels, conſidered onely as Elect, or, before their Election (for this is the notion and ſence of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries in the Point in hand) then the offence, and diſtance, occaſioned by ſin between him and them, was wholly ceaſed, and taken out of the way, before the Blood of the Covenant was ſprinkled on them, before the Attonement came at them; as the <hi>Hebrew women</hi> (in the ſtory) <hi>were delivered of their</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 19.</note> 
               <hi>children, before the midwives came at them.</hi> And if ſo, if the offence and
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:94900:249"/> diſtance cauſed between God, and his Elect, by means of ſin, was ſwallowed up in the Love of Election, ſo that he loved them now, conſidered onely as Elect, or to be Elected, as much, as He did, or could do, upon their actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing into Chriſt, and participation of His Death, to what purpoſe ſhould Chriſt dye for them? or what profit is there in the Blood of Chriſt, as to them? God thought every whit as well of them, loved them as much, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do as much for them, yea irreverſibly decreed, adjudged as great things unto them, before, and without, all conſideration had of the Death of Chriſt, as He did, or could do, upon the conſideration of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God out of His Love of Election (as the Doctrine of Election is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taught, and received amongſt us) did in the very Act or Decree of His Election, freely, and of His meer good will and pleaſure, irrevocably aſſign, adjudg, make over, and give, to His Elect, Juſtification, Salvation, Glorification, and what not in this kinde? And if ſo, <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not dye to purchaſe, or procure theſe things for them: becauſe they were truly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and by right of free donation, theirs before. It were ridiculous for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any friend of mine, to go and lay down a great ſum of money to purchaſe or procure that on my behalf, which I have already aſſured unto me by the free, and ſtable, and irrevocable gift and donation of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hath a full right and power to give it unto me. Therefore whereas many amongſt us cry out of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> as a moſt dangerous Hereſie, and the great abomination of their Souls; the truth is, that themſelves teach and hold as rank and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> in their Opinion about Election, as the greateſt <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves can do. For what is the maſter-veyn in the body of this Hereſie, but to deny that <hi>Chriſt</hi> truly ſatisfied, or made any attonement for ſin, and that upon this ground, becauſe God freely, and of His meer grace, gives for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins unto men, without any ſatisfaction? And how little doth this differ from that Doctrine of Election, which paſſeth for currant amongſt us; teaching, that forgiveneſs of ſins, and all the great things depending hereon, are aſſigned and decreed unto men in their Election, without any conſideration had of Chriſts dying for them, or their beleeving in him?</p>
            <p>If it be here ſaid; that they who hold Election<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the moſt abſolute and<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> peremptory way, do not ſay or hold, that God intends actually to confer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, or eternal Life, upon the Elect, otherwiſe then for, and through the ſatisfaction made by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for them in His<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Death; though they hold, that He intends, without any reſpect had to the conſideration of Chriſts Death, actually to confer them upon them. They exclude the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt, from having any thing to do in Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Purpoſe of Election; not from having any thing to do in the execution of this His Purpoſe: here they acknowledg it to have much to do, to be upon the matter, all in all. To this we anſwer,</p>
            <p>That this Diſtinction, or Explication of the Opinion, doth no ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, but rather burthens it more and more. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Certain it is, that God doth not purpoſe, or project one way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and act, or execute, in another: but His executions do exactly anſwer the tenor, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and form of His Purpoſes or Intentions. Men who are ſubject to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights, and conſequently to repentance, may, and many times do, vary from their model or platform, when they come to action, becauſe ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing (it may be) hath come in their way, then they thought upon in the firſt projection of their work: But nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can come in Gods way either
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:94900:249"/> more ſatisfactory, or better pleaſing unto Him, then what was preſent with Him in the firſt contrivance or projection of His affairs. Therefore if in point of execution, He actually confers Remiſſion of ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and Salvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe of, and with reſpect unto, the Death and Satisfaction of Chriſt, it is a certain ſign, that He purpoſed this collation of them in His Purpoſe of Election<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon no other terms: and conſequently that in Gods very Purpoſe of Electing men unto Salvation, He had reſpect unto the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yea and to their ingraffing into Him by beleeving: and that He never purpoſed Salvation unto any, without inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2.

               </hi> this clearly ſhews, that Gods actings, His actual and preſent Diſpenſations, are adequately and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly conformable, unto His Purpoſes, or Projections.

Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> God is ſaid to have <hi>glorified</hi> thoſe, whom He intends, or hath decreed, to <hi>glorifie.</hi> Thus alſo, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. and again, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5.

               <hi>ſaved</hi> thoſe, who were not actually ſaved, but onely under His Purpoſe of ſaving them, (to omit many the like.)

Well, but what was the Nature, or Tenor of this Purpoſe or Decree of His concerning our <hi>Election?</hi> or how, and in what ſence it is ſaid, to have been <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> (as the Apoſtle here aſſerts it to have been?)

In this ſence the Prepoſition is uſed, a Verſe or two after; a place that will give light to the phraſe in hand. <gap reason="foreign">

               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>the praiſe of the glory of His Grace, whereby He hath made us accepted in His Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; i. e.</hi> hath made us dear, and neer, and precious to Himſelf, by means of the Death, Satisfaction, and Attonement made by His Beloved Son for us. By the way, if the <hi>Grace</hi> of God it ſelf (and that in the glory of it, in which conſideration the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of it) doth no other ways, upon no other terms, render us <hi>accepted</hi> with Him, but onely in, <hi>and through His Beloved, viz.</hi> as having made our Peace, by the Attonement of His Death for us, then were we not ſo highly accepted with Him through any <hi>Purpoſe of Election,</hi> (eſpecially if we ſhall conceive this <hi>Purpoſe of Election</hi> to have been conceived in God, before, and without all conſideration of the Death of Chriſt) as the common Notion of Election ſuggeſteth. So then, God is ſaid to have <hi>purpoſed our</hi> Election, or <hi>chuſing, in Chriſt,</hi> becauſe His Purpoſe was to ſeparate, elect and chuſe thoſe, who ſhould beleeve in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for his ſake in whom they beleeve, to Salvation. This Interpretation might be much cleared and confirmed, by the opening of theſe words (which we had not long ſince in hand,) <hi>Rom. 9. 11. That the Purpoſe of God according to Election,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 11.</note> 
               <hi>might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth.</hi> The Purpoſe of God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Election, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Purpoſe, Counſel, or Decree of God, according unto which, or, in conformity whereunto, He ordereth and manageth His <hi>Election</hi> of Perſons in time, is here deſcribed, 1. Negatively, <hi>not of works.</hi> 2. Affirmatively, in theſe words, <hi>but of him that calleth.</hi> When the Apoſtle denies <hi>the Purpoſe of God according to Election,</hi> to be <hi>of works,</hi> his meaning clearly is, that God did not <hi>purpoſe</hi> to <hi>elect,</hi> ſeparate, or chuſe thoſe men to eternal Life, who ſhould ſeek their Juſtification by <hi>the works</hi> of the Law. Again when he affirmeth, this <hi>Purpoſe of God according to Election,</hi> to be <hi>of him that calleth,</hi> (meaning, of God himſelf, who calleth Men to Juſtification and Salvation,) his meaning as clearly is, that the Tenor of Gods <hi>Purpoſe,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto which he means to elect and chuſe Men and Women to eternal
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:94900:250"/> Life, is this; <hi>viz.</hi> to make choyce of thoſe for this bleſſed end and purpoſe, who ſhall beleeve in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, or ſeek their Juſtification by Faith. This Purpoſe is ſaid to be <hi>of Him that calleth,</hi> in oppoſition, to a Being <hi>of Works:</hi> becauſe <hi>a Purpoſe according to Election,</hi> which ſhould be <hi>of Works,</hi> is the <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of them that are <hi>called, viz.</hi> Men; they conceive and think, that God ſhould <hi>purpoſe</hi> and intend to <hi>chuſe</hi> thoſe only unto life, who ſhould be diligent Obſervers of the Law, and ſeek their Juſtification that way: but now <hi>the Purpoſe of God according to Election,</hi> is not formed or ſhaped accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſence, or Notion, of thoſe that are <hi>called,</hi> who generally pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Works;</hi> but according to the ſence and minde of God Himſelf, <hi>who calleth;</hi> who, as we know, hath declined <hi>Works,</hi> for ſuch a purpoſe, and hath choſen, <hi>Faith.</hi> So that the Apoſtles meaning in this Antitheſis, <hi>not of Works, but of Him that calleth,</hi> is plainly this, <hi>not of Works,</hi> but of Faith; Faith, and Works, being famous Antagoniſts or Competitors in the writings of this Apoſtle, for Juſtification, the one, as ſet up by God; the other, by Men. The ſame Interpretation of the phraſe, <hi>who hath choſen us in Chriſt,</hi> may be yet further ſtrengthened, by that in <hi>Peter. Elect according to the Foreknowledg of</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>God the Father, through Sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Firſt, he ſaluteth them as perſons <hi>Elect,</hi> or choſen, <hi>according to the Foreknowledg</hi> [or Pre-approbation, as we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved the word frequently to ſignifie] <hi>of God the Father; i. e.</hi> as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo qualified, or, as having obtained ſuch an eſtate and condition, wherein <hi>God the Father</hi> from Eternity judged it meet to <hi>Elect</hi> or chuſe the perſons of men unto Salvation, or to eſtimate and account men meet, or worthy eternal Life. In this ſence he terms them <hi>Elect according to the Foreknowledg,</hi> or Fore-approbation, <hi>of God;</hi> meaning, that their preſent condition in beleeving, did, according to the Tenor of the eternal Counſel and Purpoſe of God in that behalf, ſeparate between them, and the generality of the world, who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their unbelief, were looked upon by him, and adjudged as the refuſe of Men, in compariſon of them, and, in their preſent poſture, unmeet to have Salvation conferred upon them.</p>
            <p>2. He particularly deſcribeth, what that qualification, or condition, is, which God foreknew, or <hi>fore-approved,</hi> as meet for Him to regulate His Election of the Perſons of Men by, and wherein now they were inveſted, and conſequently, <hi>Elected,</hi> in thoſe words; <hi>through ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and the ſprinkling, &amp;c.</hi> His meaning is, that they, through the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and gracious co-operation of the Spirit of God, were now brought to yeeld Obedience unto the Goſpel, to beleeve in <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> as he who by his Death had purchaſed Remiſſion of ſins for them, &amp;c. implying, that ſuch an eſtate and condition, as this, <hi>Sanctification by the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> is that very eſtate, wherein what perſon, or perſons of men ſoever, ſhould at any time be found, God in his eternal Counſel judged it meet to confer the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable title of <hi>Elect,</hi> or choſen, together with the Grace and Priviledg of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, upon them. So that to <hi>chuſe us in Christ,</hi> doth not ſignifie, to <hi>chuſe us</hi> perſonally conſidered with <hi>Christ,</hi> or, in the ſame act of Election, wherein, or wherewith, <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>choſen,</hi> or the like; but to intend, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or decree to <hi>chuſe us,</hi> as being, or when we ſhould be <hi>in Christ,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. Having once obtained this Being, a Being in <hi>Christ</hi> by Faith, we may truly, and in good propriety of ſpeaking, be ſaid to be <hi>choſen,</hi> by means, or by vertue, of that Purpoſe, or Decree of Election, which was in God <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundations of the world,</hi> whereby he decreed to <hi>chuſe</hi> all thoſe unto

In ſuch a ſence likewiſe all thoſe of <hi>Aarons</hi> Poſterity, who came to be Prieſts, though many generations after, may be ſaid to have attained this Office and Dignity, by vertue of the Law concerning Perſons admitable into this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was enacted and made by God long before. The Scripture it ſelf aſcribeth a vertue, or power unto the Law to make <hi>Priests. For the Law</hi> MAKETH MEN HIGH PRIESTS, <hi>which have infirmity</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 7. 28.</note>. In like manner, that Law, Purpoſe, or Decree of Election, wherein, and whereby, God, before the foundations of the World, determined to chuſe all thoſe that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt, may be ſaid to make all thoſe Elect, or choſen, who do thus beleeve: yea and God himſelf, by means of this his Purpoſe, or Decree, may be ſaid to have Elected, or <hi>choſen,</hi> all thoſe who do at any time beleeve, <hi>from before the foundations of the World.</hi> Thus we have done with our ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; wherein we have fairly and clearly proved, 1. That Chriſt needed not to dye at all for the Elect, in the common Notion of the word, Elect. 2. That He did not dye for the Elect onely, in any ſence or Notion of the ſaid word whatſoever: and conſequently, that He dyed for all Men.</p>
            <p>A third Demonſtration of the Point, is this: <hi>If Christ dyed not for all</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 6. <hi>Argum. 3.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Men, then are not all Men bound to beleeve in Him, or on Him, for Salvation, or, as a Saviour: But all Men are bound to beleeve on Him, for Salvation. Ergo.</hi> The Reaſon of the Major Propoſition is clearly this: No man is bound to lay out his ſilver, for that which is not bread; nor to ſtay himſelf, with any confidence or aſſurance, upon any perſon whatſoever, for help or ſuccor in any kinde, concerning whom he knoweth not whether he hath wherewith to help him, or no. Therefore except all Men had a ſufficient ground to beleeve, that there is Redemption and Salvation for them in Jeſus Chriſt, they were not bound to beleeve on Him as a Saviour, or to depend upon Him for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if Men have a ſufficient ground to beleeve that there is Redemption and Salvation for them in Chriſt, and that if they come unto Him for it, they ſhall partake of it, then muſt it needs be a Truth that He hath theſe things for them indeed; and conſequently that He dyed for them: becauſe no man can have a ſufficient ground to beleeve that which is not, or that which is falſe. This Propoſition is ſo plain, ſo obvious to every mans capacity and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, yea to common ſence it ſelf, that I cannot well ſuſpect the leaſt queſtion or doubt in any about the Truth of it; If Chriſt dyed not for all Men, then are not all Men bound to beleeve on Him for Salvation.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding if any ſhall object and ſay; It is true, if Chriſt dyed not ſufficiently for all Men, all Men were not bound to beleeve in Him for Salvation: but we grant that in this ſence, <hi>viz.</hi> ſufficiently, He did dye for all Men. And this is a ſufficient ground to oblige all Men to beleeve on Him for Salvation, though He dyed not intentionally for them. To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By demanding, what men mean in ſaying, that Chriſt dyed ſufficiently for all Men, in oppoſition to His dying intentionally for them? If they ſay, they mean, that the Death of Chriſt, ſimply and in it ſelf conſidered, was, or is, ſufficient to redeem and ſave all Men, as well as thoſe, who are redeemed
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:94900:251"/> and ſaved by it; but was not intended by God, or by <hi>Christ,</hi> for any ſuch end or purpoſe as the Redemption of all: I anſwer; If ſo, then was that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy or over-plus of merit or attonement in the Death of Chriſt, which remains over and above what is neceſſary for the Redemption of thoſe, for whom it was intended, and who are actually redeemed by it, ſuffered by God to run to waſte, and to be <hi>like water ſpilt upon the ground.</hi> And if ſo, then was there but a very ſmall quantity or proportion of the worth and value of the Death of Chriſt intended by God for uſe, or to do either Himſelf, or his Creature, any ſervice, in compariſon of what vaniſheth into the ayr, and is thrown behinde his back, as good for nothing. For if there be a ſufficiency in it for all thoſe who are not redeemed by it, theſe being a far greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, then thoſe, who are, or are ſuppoſed to be, actually redeemed by it; it muſt needs follow, that if that proportion of it, which was ſufficient for them, was not deſigned or intended by God for them, that far the greater part of it was deſigned by him unto vanity, and to no more honor, then that which is not. Thus we ſee how they that deny the Death of <hi>Christ</hi> for all Men <hi>intentionally,</hi> and yet grant it <hi>ſufficiently,</hi> count <hi>the blood of the Covenant,</hi> at leaſt the far greateſt part of it, <hi>as an unholy thing,</hi> as that which is conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to no holy uſe, end, or purpoſe; yea, and that which is yet worſe, make God himſelf, and <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> the drawers, or makers up of this account to their hand.</p>
            <p>If they reply and ſay; that that remainder of the value and price of the Death of Chriſt, though it was not intended by God for the Salvation of thoſe, who are not actually redeemed by him, yet it was intended for their condemnation, and ſo not loſt; I anſwer, that this is yet worſe, and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, then the other. For, 1. might not men as reaſonably ſay, that God made the Sun, and put him into the midſt of the Firmament of Heaven, to bring night and darkneſs upon the world, as that he gave his Son Jeſus Chriſt unto Death for the Condemnation of the World? <hi>For God ſent not his Son</hi> (ſaith Chriſt himſelf) <hi>into the World, to condemn the World; but that the World through him ſhould be ſaved</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 3. 17.</note>. And elſewhere; <hi>I came not to judg the World, but to ſave the World</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 12. 47</note>. And <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt clearly expreſſeth the end and intent of Chriſts Death: <hi>Joh. 1. Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the World</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 1. 29</note>. Men may as well ſay, that the end and intent of the Sacrifices offered up by the Prieſts under the Law, was, not to make at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for men, or to purge them, but to bring more guilt upon them, as ſay, that the intent of. Chriſt in ſacrificing himſelf was not to ſave, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn men. 2. It is not the manner of God, nor is it agreeable either with his Wiſdom, or his goodneſs, to make things proper and fitting for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to paſs of good and gracious ends, and then to conſign them over to the effecting of ends of a quite contrary nature and import: as (<hi>v. g.</hi>) to create wholeſom and ſavory meats, which are apt and proper to nouriſh, and make the lives of men comfortable to them; and to deſign theſe, being thus created, to the deſtruction, or diſcomfort of the lives of men. Indeed when men abuſe their <hi>Tables,</hi> and are unthankful to him, that ſpred them for them, it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with his Wiſdom, and no ways diſagreeing with his goodneſs, to make them to become <hi>ſnares</hi> unto them. And in this ſence onely are all thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and expreſſions in the Scriptures to be underſtood, where any thing penal, or that is contrary to the peace and comfort of men, is preſented, as the end of Chriſts coming into, or going out of, the World by Death. As where he ſaith, that he <hi>came not to bring peace, but a ſword;</hi> and to <hi>put fire on Earth;</hi>
               <pb n="466" facs="tcp:94900:252"/> that he <hi>came for judgment into the World;</hi> that he <hi>was ſet, as well for the falling, as for the riſing, of many in Iſrael:</hi> with the like. All ſuch ſayings as theſe, import onely the event, or ſecondary Intentions of God in ſending <hi>Christ</hi> into the World, not thoſe which were primary and predominant in him: or to ſpeak more properly, they do not import any Intention at all on Gods part, in, or about the ſending of <hi>Christ</hi> into the World, but onely ſhew, partly how unworthily ſome men will, or poſſibly may, behave themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being come into the World; partly, what the Intentions of God are concerning thoſe, who ſhall behave themſelves thus unworthily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. See what hath been formerly delivered in upon this account, and ſubſcribed by <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, Cap. 5. Sect. 22.</p>
            <p>If it be yet further ſaid; yea but if God had had an intent to ſave, though<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> but a ſmaller number, then now he intends to ſave, yet he could not have ſaved them by a Sacrifice of leſs value and merit, then that, by which he now intendeth to ſave thoſe, who ſhall be ſaved by <hi>Christ;</hi> and conſequently, not by a Sacrifice of leſs value, then that, which hath in it a great ſurpluſſage, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy of merit, above what was barely neceſſary or ſufficient to ſave thoſe, whoſe Salvation was intended. Therefore this over-plus of merit, cannot be ſaid to be loſt, or to be caſt aſide by God, as unſerviceable; in as much as it is eſſential unto, and abſolutely inſeparable from that Sacrifice, which was ſimply neceſſary for the Salvation of thoſe, whom he intended to ſave. As ſuppoſe two or three men were in ſuch a ſtraight for meat to eat, being ready to periſh through extremity of hunger, and could make no proviſion for their lives, but onely by ſlaying of an Ox, or a Sheep, that came in their way, and when they had ſlain them, could not tell what to do with nine parts of ten of them; in this caſe ſo much of the fleſh of this Ox, or Sheep, as theſe men knew not how to diſpoſe of to any ſerviceable end, cannot properly therefore be ſaid to be loſt, or to be caſt aſide by them, as good for nothing; becauſe it was a natural part of that beaſt, which they were neceſſitated to ſlay for the preſervation of their lives. To this Objection alſo we anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of conceſſion, It is true, if God had intended to ſave, but the one half (or had it been a far leſs proportion then ſo) of thoſe perſons, men and women, who now ſhall be ſaved, he could not have done it, in that way of Wiſdom and Juſtice, wherein he now intends to ſave men, by any Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or Attonement of leſs value, then hath now been offered for thoſe, who ſhall be ſaved: and conſequently, which ſhould not have had an over-plus and redundancy of merit in it, ſufficient to ſave many millions of perſons, beſides thoſe, who in ſuch a caſe, and under ſuch a ſuppoſition, ſhould be ſaved by it. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I anſwer further (by way of exception) that notwithſtanding this, if God ſhould have given ſuch a Sacrifice or Attonement for the ſaving of a few onely, which was ſufficient to ſave more, yea all (without exception) and not intended the ſaving of all thoſe, who were capable of Salvation by it, he ſhould voluntarily, and without any neceſſity at all, nay contrary to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate cries of the extream miſery of ſo many thouſands in his ears, have made fruſtrate and voyd the far greateſt and richeſt part of that Sacrifice or Attonement. As ſuppoſe in the inſtance given of the men, that in an exigent were neceſſitated to ſlay the Ox, or Sheep, ſpoken of, for the preſervation of their lives; it is true, they could not be charged with ſpoyling or making waſte of that which remained of the fleſh of either, beſides what was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for themſelves, ſimply becauſe they ſlew the Ox for their own neceſſity,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:94900:252"/> being in a condition of imminent danger of their lives otherwiſe; but ſuppoſe there had been many poor Souls hard at hand, in as much danger of ſtarving as themſelves, in caſe they had refuſed or neglected to have given unto them of the remaining fleſh we ſpeak of, and would rather have buried it under ground, where they might not finde it, or make it any ways unfit for meat and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto them; in this caſe they might juſtly be charged with making ſpoyl and waſte of that fleſh, which remained unto them, when themſelves had eaten, and that upon terms of the greateſt unmercifulneſs and unworthineſs. In like manner do they, who acknowledg the Death of Chriſt ſufficient for all, and yet affirm it to be given or intended by God onely to ſome few, charge him, and that upon terms of much unworthineſs, and very diſhonorable to him, to evacuate, or make of no uſe or effect the far greateſt part of this Death, there being ſo many Millions of Souls before him in the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of miſery, to whom it might, and that with double and treble honor both to his wiſdom and goodneſs, be diſpoſed. Therefore certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the Death of Chriſt was ſufficient for all, it was intended by God for all. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe it were granted, that Chriſt dyed ſufficiently for all, yet unleſs it be granted withall, that he dyed intentionally for all, the ſufficiency of His Death, is no ſufficient ground for all Men (nor indeed for any man) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on Him, or to caſt themſelves upon Him, for Salvation. <hi>Nabal</hi> was a rich man, and had ſufficient to have relieved <hi>David</hi> and his men in their neceſſity, and his ſheep-ſhearers too. But yet <hi>David</hi> and his men had no ſufficient ground to depend upon him for relief in their extremity: nor is it like they would have repaired to him for relief, if they had known his churliſh and inhumane diſpoſition before. In like manner, that Opinion which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents God as minding onely, and intending the Salvation of a few peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relating to Him by a Purpoſe of Election, in the Death of Chriſt, but altogether averſe from ſo much as hearing of the ſaving of all others thereby, what doth it elſe but diſſolve and looſe all bonds of engagement, or obligement upon men, to beleeve on Chriſt, or on God through Chriſt, for Salvation? For who is bound to ſeek water from a flint, or to repair to <hi>thorns</hi> in hope <hi>to gather grapes</hi> from them? For they, who deny that God intendeth the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all Men by <hi>Christ,</hi> repreſent him to the generality of men upon no better terms of compariſon, then of a flint to him that wanteth water, and of thorns, to him whoſe Soul luſteth after grapes.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, Yes: there is reaſon and ground ſufficient for all Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> exception to beleeve on Chriſt for Salvation, though it be not ſuppoſed that He dyed for all Men. Becauſe the Promiſe of God howſoever is general and free unto all: Whoſoever beleeves on Him, ſhall be ſaved. To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p>It is true, the Promiſe is general and free unto all: and this generality and freeneſs of the Promiſe plainly ſheweth the generality and freeneſs of the Salvation promiſed to all Men, to be commenſurable with the Promiſe, and extenſible to as many, as it. Otherwiſe the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhall be found lyars, and falſe witneſſes. For if they ſhall promiſe Salvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Men, in caſe they ſhall beleeve, when as there is no Salvation for far the greateſt part of men, whether they beleeve, or not beleeve, or in caſe they ſhould beleeve (for their beleeving, or not beleeving, do not alter the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God in the Death of Chriſt, nor multiply Salvation) do they not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake more in the behalf of God, then God himſelf, according to their
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:94900:253"/> Notion, is able or willing to perform? But this Point we have debated more liberally in the ſeventh Chapter of this Book.</p>
            <p>If it be yet ſaid; yea but God who orders and frames their Commiſſion, may without danger will them to preach and promiſe Salvation, to all that will beleeve, though Salvation be not purchaſed for all Men: becauſe He knows beforehand that thoſe onely will beleeve, for whom there is Salvation purchaſed in the Death of Chriſt. To this I anſwer:</p>
            <p>If God had kept His Intentions in this kinde to Himſelf, and had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that He intended Salvation onely to a few, there might be ſome more colour or pretence for ſuch a Plea. If He had not let the World know any thing, but that He really intended the Salvation of them all, though He ſhould in the mean time have intended but the Salvation of a very few, He might with far leſs diſhonor (at leaſt for the preſent) cauſe the Heralds of His Grace (His Miniſters I mean) to make ſuch a general Proclamation, as now He hath given them in charge to make, throughout the World, of Grace and Salvation prepared for all fleſh, for all Comers whatſoever. But to imagine and ſuppoſe, that firſt He gives the World to know and underſtand, that He intends to ſave but a very few of them; and yet this notwithſtanding, and (as it were) in the very face of ſuch a Declaration, to cauſe the great year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> to be proclaimed throughout the World, eternal Liberty and Redemption to be offered unto all fleſh, unto all perſons without exception, muſt needs be moſt unlike unto Him, and unworthy of Him, yea and have a direct tendency to make Him (that which a reverential ſence of His Majeſty makes hard to be uttered) the hatred and abhorring of all his Creatures. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to preſent his hollow-hearted and treacherous friends hateful both to God and Men, deſcribes them thus; <hi>The words of his mouth were ſmoother then butter, but war was in his Heart: His words were ſofter then oyl, yet were they</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 55: 21.</note> 
               <hi>drawn ſwords.</hi> And doth not that Opinion <hi>turn the Glory</hi> of the ever-graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>God,</hi> that great Lover of Mankinde, <hi>into the image</hi> of ſuch a vile and abominable creature as <hi>David</hi> here deſcribes, which ſaith of Him, that He comes indeed unto men, and opens the Boſom of Love unto them, ſpeaks ſweet and loving and gracious words unto them, offers them, yea and that with much importunity of urging and preſſing them to an acceptance, terms of Mercy and great Compaſſions, Forgiveneſs of Sins, Adoption, Life, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Glory, the great things of the World to come, and yet all this while, under all theſe ſweet droppings of His Lips, hath in His Heart that moſt bloody and irreconcilable War of Reprobation, a Purpoſe and Reſolution taken up and conceived within Him from the days of Eternity, never to be altered upon any terms whatſoever, of caſting them into Hell, and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the vengeance of eternal fire? Certainly that Opinion, which repreſenteth God unto men upon ſuch terms, in ſuch a ſhape as this, flatters, or rather befriends the Devil, and makes Him to have much of God in Him. And if God ſhould conceal for the preſent that Intention of His we ſpeak of, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſaving onely a few, and of deſtroying the generality of men, and yet proceed in that method which now He doth, in inviting the whole World to Grace and Favor with Him, except He ſhould conceal it to the days of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whenſoever it ſhould break forth and be diſcovered, it would occaſion the ſame reflexion of diſhonor upon Him; yea and doubtleſs would comfort and eaſe the damned in Hell, if ever the knowledg of it ſhould come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. But this for the proof of the Major Propoſition in the Argument propounded; If Chriſt dyed not for all Men, then
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:94900:253"/> are not all Men bound to beleeve on Him for Salvation.</p>
            <p>The Minor (I conceive) needs little proof, being this: <hi>But all Men are</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> 
               <hi>bound to beleeve on Him, for Salvation.</hi> However, the Truth of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is as clear as the light at Noon day, partly from the Commandment of God directed unto all Men, to beleeve on him: partly from the Threatenings of God denounced againſt all Men, that ſhall refuſe to beleeve in him: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Promiſes made unto all Men, who ſhall beleeve on him: partly alſo from the encouragements which are adminiſtred by God unto all Men to beleeve in him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is evident, that God commands all Men without exception to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Chriſt. And the times of this ignorance</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> preaching to the Idolatrous <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Athens) God winked at: but now He commandeth</hi> ALL MEN EVERY WHERE <hi>to Repent</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 17. 30.</note>: if to <hi>repent,</hi> then certainly to beleeve in <hi>Christ;</hi> without which there is no true Repentance. The Reader for his further ſatisfaction in this Point (if he be in any degree yet unſatisfied) may at leaſure peruſe and ponder the Scriptures noted in the Margent <note n="b" place="margin">1 John 3. 23. Mat. 16. 5. Rom. 10. 16. 3. Luke 14. 23.</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As God commandeth all Men to beleeve on <hi>Christ</hi> (which is indeed ſufficient to prove that they are bound to beleeve on Him) ſo doth He ſeverely threaten all thoſe that ſhall not beleeve on Him.—<hi>But He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not, ſhall be damned</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Mark 16. 16</note>. The Scriptures likewiſe abound with Paſſages of this import: a firſt-fruits whereof are preſented in the Margent <note n="d" place="margin">John 8. 24 3. 36 Acts 3. 23</note>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As God commandeth all Men to beleeve on Chriſt, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth all with Death, which ſhall not beleeve; ſo He promiſeth Life and Salvation unto all without exception, who ſhall beleeve on Him. This aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion (I conceive) is no mans queſtion, the Scriptures being ſo particular and expreſs in the frequent delivery of it <note n="e" place="margin">John 3. 16 11. 25, 26 1 Pet. 2, 6</note>.</p>
            <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) As God commandeth all Men to beleeve on Chriſt; threateneth all with Death, who ſhall not beleeve: promiſeth Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unto all who ſhall beleeve; ſo doth He encourage all to beleeve on Him; my meaning is, He tendereth and ſuggeſteth Reaſons and Motives of an encouraging and ſweetly-perſwading nature and import unto men, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. For otherwiſe, the Commands, and Promiſes of God, made unto thoſe who ſhall beleeve, are grand encouragements (in a large acception of the word) unto Men, to beleeve; and his Threatenings are more engaging to the ſervile tempers and diſpoſitions of Men, to beleeve, then any encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whatſoever. But my meaning in the Particular in hand is this; that beſides Commands and Promiſes, God lays before the Hearts of Men ſuch Conſiderations, which are apt and proper in a ſweet and encouraging way to induce Men to beleeve on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or on Himſelf through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. As for example: Sometime He preſents them with his great Love to them, as <hi>Joh. 3. 16. Tit.</hi> 3. 4, &amp;c. ſometimes with his Mercy and his Compaſſions, the greatneſs and tenderneſs of theſe, as <hi>Exod. 34. 6. Luk.</hi> 1. 72, &amp;c. ſometimes with his delight, or pleaſure-taking in ſhewing Mercy, as <hi>Mica. 7. 18. Ezek.</hi> 33. 11, &amp;c. ſometimes with his Faithfulneſs, as <hi>Hebr. 10. 23. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 13, &amp;c. ſometimes with his Oath for their greater ſecurity in his Promiſes, as <hi>Heb. 6. 17, 18. Luk.</hi> 1. 72, 73. otherwhile, with his deſire of their Salvation, as 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 4. Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while again, with the grief and trouble of his Soul at their ſtubborn courſes, and that becauſe they are, and will be, deſtructive unto them; as <hi>Ezek. 18. 31. Jerem.</hi> 44. 4. Sometimes with the abundant proviſion He hath made for their Salvation and Peace, as <hi>Mat. 22. 4. Heb.</hi> 9. 14. Sometimes likewiſe
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:94900:254"/> (to omit many other Particulars in this kinde) with the conſideration of that ſpecial glory which will accrue unto himſelf, and to his Grace, by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, and Salvation thereupon, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6, 12. and elſewhere. Now to think or ſay, that under all theſe, Commands, Threatenings, Promiſes, and all this great variety of encouragements directed unto all Men to beleeve, yet all Men are not bound to beleeve, is to me the thought and ſaying onely of ſuch a man, who is reſolved to ſtand by his own thoughts and ſayings, againſt any light or evidence of Truth whatſoever.</p>
            <p>A fourth Argument, evincing the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for all Men, is this.<note place="margin">§. 10. <hi>Argum. 4.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>If God really and unfeignedly intends, or deſires, the Salvation of thoſe who periſh, then He really intended the Death of Chriſt for all Men.</hi> This Propoſition we ſhall not need to prove, but onely by this brief account. All Men (without exception) are either ſuch, who are ſaved, or ſuch who periſh: and that God really intended the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for thoſe that are ſaved, is no mans doubt, or conteſt. Therefore if He really intended the Salvation of thoſe alſo, who periſh, in, or by, the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> He intended this Death of Chriſt for all. This Propoſition then being undenyable, I proceed, and aſſume thus: <hi>But God really &amp; unfeignedly intends or deſires the ſalvation, of thoſe who periſh. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he intended the Death of Chriſt for all Men.</hi> This latter Propoſition, That God really and unfeignedly deſires the Salvation of thoſe that periſh, is clearly proved by this conſideration; <hi>viz.</hi> that God ſo frequently, ſo fervently and pathetically in the Scriptures profeſſeth his deſires of the Peace and Salvation of ſuch men, yea and an holy regret of Soul in Himſelf, when they will ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly run courſes deſtructive to their Salvation, contrary to his deſires and endevors with them in this kinde. Let us give inſtance in ſome Paſſages of ſuch an import, as we ſpeak of. <hi>O that there were ſuch an Heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever</hi>

So again by <hi>David, Pſal. 81. O that my people had harkened unto me, and Iſrael had walked in my ways, I ſhould ſoon have ſubdued their enemies, and turned my hand againſt their adverſaries</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pſa. 81. 13, 14</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the Lord ſpeaks concerning thoſe, <hi>whom</hi> (as he had immediately before ſaid) <hi>He had given up to their own hearts luſts, and who walked in their own counſels.</hi> That expreſſion alſo of the Lord in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is of the ſame character. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Iſrael, I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way thou ſhouldſt go; O that thou hadſt harkened unto my Commandments, then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteouſneſs as the waves of the Sea</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Iſai. 48. 17</note>. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto this alſo in the ſame Prophet may be joyned: <hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts, a people that provoketh me to anger to my face, that ſacrificeth in gardens</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Iſai. 65. 2</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By <hi>ſpreading forth the hands</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> Engliſhed upon the place) he <hi>ſignifies a dayly ſummoning of them,</hi> and that TO DRAVV AND UNITE THEM UNTO HIMSELF. A little after; <hi>The Lord never ſpeaks unto us, but He there with all ſtretcheth forth His Hand to unite us unto Himſelf, and cauſeth us to feel that He is neer unto us. Yea He ſo manifeſts His</hi> FATHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY LOVE, <hi>and ſo willingly accepts of us, that if we yeeld not obedience unto his voyce, we ought juſtly to impute the ſame to our own frowardneſs.</hi> So that <hi>Calvins</hi> Judgment clearly is, that in this, and ſuch like places, God profeſſeth a reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Intention and Deſire in Him <hi>to draw and unite unto Himſelf [i. e.</hi> to

            <p>Add hereunto onely two places more (for the preſent) though there be many others to be found. The former of theſe ſhall be that in <hi>Jer. 44. 4, 5.

               <note n="a" place="margin">Jer. 44. 4, 5</note>. The latter place is in the New Teſtament. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as an Hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!

Is it a thing of any reaſonable reſentment in the leaſt, that God ſhould poſitively and peremptorily determine and decree from Eternity, that which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to His Will of Approbation? Or is not the deſtruction of thoſe, who periſh, contrary to their Salvation? Therefore if God approveth of their Salvation, and yet peremptorily decreeth their Condemnation, (whether poſitively, or permiſſively onely, as theſe men count Permiſſion, is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, as we formerly obſerved <note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 2. §. 20</note>) doth He not decree that from Eternity, which His Soul hateth, or abhorreth, or (which is the ſame) which is contrary to His Will of Approbation? And who ever decreed ſuch a thing, which is contrary to what he approveth, taketh pleaſure, or delighteth in? No man ever yet, being in poſſeſſion of his Senſes, though but common and ordinary, decreed his own Sorrow, or any thing contrary to what he approveth.

Or could the ſame ſubject, or matter of truth, which they hold forth, have been delivered with more grace, or with better advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the underſtandings of men, in other terms, or forms of expreſſion, then thoſe ſpecified? Yea the truth is, that very little, if any thing at all, concerning God, can be conveyed by words unto the mindes and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:94900:256"/> of men, but by expreſſions which are figurative, (the Reaſon whereof, hath, I remember, been formerly obſerved by us.) And for the Scriptures, queſtionleſs there is in them more of the Knowledg of God, and of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, taught by <hi>Anthropopathies,</hi> and that kinde of dialect, which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth things proper unto men to make known unto us things proper unto God, then by all other kindes of phraſe or expreſſions whatſoever. Now then this I would demand of thoſe, who of the <hi>Anthropopathies</hi> found in the Scriptures under preſent conſideration, think to make ſhields and Bucklers againſt the dint and force of the Argument drawn from them, I would, I ſay, willingly demand of theſe men, what other ſence, or what other matter of information, inſtruction, edification, they can make of the ſaid places, but onely this, or that which is equivalent to it, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is that eminently, or tranſcendently, in God, or in the Divine Being, which relateth unto the Salvation of thoſe, who notwithſtanding <hi>in fine</hi> periſh, after the ſame manner, wherein the earneſt wiſhes, and moſt ſerious and cordial deſires in men, relate unto their reſpective objects, or things ſo wiſhed and deſired by them.</p>

For be it granted, that God in the ſaid Paſſages, condeſcends to the infirm and weak apprehenſions of men, and teacheth them myſteries, <hi>as they are able to hear</hi> and underſtand, doth it follow from hence, that therefore He teacheth them nothing at all, ſpeaks nothing at all to their underſtandings in theſe places? If it be granted that in them he ſpeaks any thing at all to the underſtandings of Men, I demand (as lately) what can it elſe be, but that He truly, really, cordially, affectionately, wiſheth, willeth, deſireth, (in ſuch a ſence, as he truly, really, cordially, affectionately, wiſheth, willeth, deſireth any other thing) the Salvation of ſuch men, who yet through their own voluntary neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and unworthineſs, in concluſion periſh, and are not ſaved? And if ſo, then doth that Doctrine, either arraign the Moſt Holy and Bleſſed God of the fouleſt Hypocriſie and Diſſimulation, that lightly can be imagined, which affirmeth, that notwithſtanding the ſolemnity and frequency of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>tends to ſeparate and divide between the Creature, and His Creator bleſſed for ever, or to create and raiſe Jealouſies and hard Thoughts in the former against the latter, cannot be Evangelical, or Truth. But ſuch is the Doctrine, which denyeth that Chriſt dyed for all Men, without exception. Ergo.</hi> The Major Propoſition in this Argument, carryeth a ſufficiency of light in it for the manifeſtation of its own Truth. The clear and know Project, and Intent of the Goſpel, is <hi>to reconcile all things both in Heaven and on Earth into one,</hi> (as we lately heard from the Apoſtle) to ſlay and deſtroy that enmity, which is ſo apt to ariſe and work in the mindes and thoughts of men againſt God, through a conſciouſneſs of their ſinful lives and ways, in conjunction with thoſe ſtrong impreſſions upon their Conſcience of his infinite Holineſs and
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:94900:257"/> Majeſty; and ſo to create and plant in their ſtead worthy and honorable thoughts of God, full of love, ſweetneſs, and peace, in the inward parts of men, (as we argued and proved at large from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 5. Sect. 28, 29, &amp;c.</note>) Therefore that Doctrine, the face whereof is ſet a quite contrary way, as <hi>viz.</hi> to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, ſoment, and encreaſe thoſe evil and hard thoughts of God, which the ſenſe of ſin and guilt (as hath been ſaid) are marvelouſly apt to ingender in the hearts and ſpirits of Men, muſt needs be Anti-Evangelical, and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſpiration much differing from that, whereby the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was given unto the World. So that to <hi>cloath</hi> this Propoſition with light, we ſhall not need to <hi>labor, or ſpin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor need we be put to much trouble for proof of the latter Propoſition, had not the adverſe Doctrine gotten the advantage of poſſeſſion againſt the clear Truth, in the Judgments of Men. For what can be more apparant, then that ſuch a Doctrine, which manifeſtly importeth the cauſleſs, peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, irremediable, and unremovable hatred of God againſt far the greateſt part of Men, and this burning to the bottom of Hell; the Perſons alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom this Hatred is ſuppoſed to be lodged in Him, being unknown; What (I ſay) can be more apparant, then that ſuch a Doctrine as this, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with open face tends to a moſt ſad, horrid, and deſperate alienation of the Heart and Soul of the poor Creature, Man, from his dear, and ever-bleſſed Creator, God? Or is it poſſible that ſuch a Creature, ſhould truly, cordially, or entirely love, or delight in Him that made him, in caſe he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knows, or otherwiſe hath ſtrong grounds of jealouſie and fear, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made him, and without any offence taken at, or reſpect had unto, any of his future ſins, or unworthy carriages in the leaſt, he ſo far hated and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated him, as to reſolve, againſt all mediation whatſoever, to caſt him out of his ſight, to devote and doom him to ſuffer <hi>the vengeance of eternal ſire?</hi> Or doth not that Doctrine, which denyeth that God intended the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the Salvation of all Men, manifeſtly import and ſuppoſe, that <hi>God</hi> to ſuch a degree hated and abhorred, or however purpoſed and decreed to hate and abhor, the far greateſt part of Men from Eternity, as to reſolve, againſt all means poſſible to be uſed by them, or purpoſed to be uſed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for prevention, to pour out the fierceneſs of his Wrath upon their heads in flames of unquenchable fire? The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> teacheth us, that the Love of <hi>God [i. e.</hi> Love towards <hi>God</hi>] muſt, or ought to, be kindled in the Hearts of Men, by a ſenſe or apprehenſion of a precedency of this affection in him towards them. <hi>We love Him</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) becauſe He firſt loved us;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 19 <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</note> or (as the Original will indifferently bear, as <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf obſerves, and grants) <hi>Let us love Him, becauſe He loved us first.</hi> According to either of theſe conſtructions of the words, the intimation is pregnant, that the Love of <hi>God</hi> towards Men apprehended and beleeved, is, and ought to be, the proper ſeed of a reciprocal affection in Men towards Him. And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture moſt frequently conjures Men to love <hi>God,</hi> upon the account of his great Love towards them manifeſted by the gift of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> unto them. Now if Love declared and reſented be the natural and proper ſeed of the ſame affection in another, then Hatred diſcovered and apprehended, muſt needs be a ſeed of a contrary import, and of like aptneſs to beget in its own likeneſs alſo. For though <hi>God</hi> chargeth Men to <hi>love their enemies,</hi> and <hi>thoſe that hate them,</hi> yet he doth it upon the account of that great and ſignal Love, which he hath firſt ſhewed unto them in the gift of his onely begotten and dear Son. And we ſee, notwithſtanding this great Commandment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:94900:257"/> by <hi>God</hi> upon Men, and that upon the advantage of ſuch a rational and equitable ground, or motive, for the performance of it, yet with what diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and renitency of the fleſh, even in Men truly ſanctified, yea and with what rareneſs of example, it is effectually, if at all, performed. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible then muſt it needs be, that Men ſhould truly love <hi>God,</hi> whileſt they apprehend him as an Enemy, bent in an unplacable and unappeaſable manner, to deſtroy them, and that with the moſt formidable deſtruction they are capable of enduring, and this to the days of Eternity? Eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they have no advantage, or motive, of any love ſhewed unto them by another, any ways conſiderable, whereby to be ſtrengthened, or enabled to love him, againſt ſo ſore a ſtumbling block and obſtruction, in the way of this affection, as a Reprobating of them from Eternity. This Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſo pregnant of Proof and Conviction, that (certain I am) nothing can with any ſtrength, ſcarce with any face, of Reaſon, be alledged againſt it. But meet it is that the Poor ſhould be hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. To the Argument now urged, it may be replyed; That the Doctrine<note place="margin">§. 13. <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> which affirmeth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed onely for the Elect, and not for all Men in general, hath no ſuch tendency or aptneſs in it, as the ſaid Argument chargeth upon it, to ſeparate between <hi>God,</hi> and any of his Creatures; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it leaveth an hope to every Perſon of Mankinde, diſtributively conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they may be of the number of the Elect, and conſequently of thoſe, for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed. There is no man, or woman, but may, the ſaid Doctrine notwithſtanding, be of a good and comfortable hope, that <hi>Christ</hi> dyed for them; and ſo have no ground to conceive hardly of <hi>God,</hi> or to be alienated in their mindes or hearts from him. To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p>Be it granted, that the Doctrine we blame, leaveth a degree of hope to every <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> Perſon, that he is one of thoſe, for whom Chriſt dyed, yet it is an hope very faint and feeble, and which muſt needs be ſick at the heart, as being over-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced many degrees by contrary jealouſies and fears; and ſo can at no hand be termed a good or comfortable hope; or give any advantage by way of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unto the Creature, to think well and honorably of God. The truth is, it is rather a poſſibility of conceit, then any well-grounded Hope, that ſuch a Doctrine leaveth, or affordeth unto any man, being yet in his unregenerate eſtate, that he is one of thoſe, for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed. Suppoſe fourty, or an hundred men ſhould be arraigned and found guilty of High Treaſon againſt their Prince, and He ſhould declare, without naming any of their Perſons, that he would graciouſly pardon the Offence of one, or two of them, but was reſolved, againſt all poſſible interveniencies whatſoever, to inflict in the moſt ſevere manner, the Penalty of Death upon all the reſt, would ſuch an hope of eſcape, or of finding favor in the eyes of their Prince, as ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, or left, unto theſe men in this caſe, be any conſiderable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ground of motive unto them reſpectively, to conceive honorably of their Prince, for clemency, goodneſs, and mercy? Or would not the ſeverity and peremptorineſs of his reſolutions to take away the lives of the generality or far greateſt part of them, rather repreſent him to their mindes as a man of rigor and extremity againſt thoſe that provoke him? Much more ſhould theſe men, and all others, have juſt ground to judg this Prince to be a Perſon of an hard ſpirit, addicted unto cruelties and blood, in caſe they ſhould know, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from himſelf, and by his own profeſſion, that long before any of the ſaid Perſons were touched with the leaſt guilt, yea or thought, of Treaſon, he
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:94900:258"/> was peremptorily reſolved to have the blood and lives of them all, one or two onely excepted? And as for his granting Pardon unto this one, or two, there being no ground in Reaſon, or Equity, why he ſhould reſpect theſe, more then the other, may it not ſeem rather the working of a meer humor, or a conceited and groundleſs action, then any fruit of an habitual goodneſs or clemency of diſpoſition, or of any mature or conſiderate deliberation? And doth not the Doctrine which we condemn for that capital crime of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all Men, draw the portraicture of God reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in all the lineaments of his face the hard favor'dneſs of ſuch a Prince? Firſt, It repreſents him as engaged, and this againſt all poſſibility of relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea and this to the days of Eternity, in Counſels and Purpoſes of Blood, yea of the Blood of the precious Souls of Men. Secondly, It preſenteth him, as thus engaged againſt millions of millions of theſe Souls; yea againſt the whole maſs or element of Mankinde, a ſmall remnant (comparatively) onely excepted, and theſe for a long time, if not during the whole term of their Mortality, undiſcernable from the reſt; within the compaſs of which term notwithſtanding they muſt be prevailed with to love God, or elſe they are loſt for Eternity. Thirdly, The ſaid Doctrine portraitureth him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged as aforeſaid, before, and without, any conſideration or reſpect had, to any the future ſins, impenitency, unbelief, or any other, of thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt whom it ſuppoſeth him ſo implacably and unmercifully engaged. Fourthly (and laſtly) It holdeth Him forth unto the World, as purpoſing and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without any reaſonable or equitable cauſe, onely upon his peremptory and meer Will, to make that vaſt difference, between that ſmall remnant of men mentioned, and the numberleſs multitudes of them beſides, which conſiſts in the unmeaſurable bleſſedneſs of the former, and the unconceivable miſery and torment of the latter. Now whether this be to form the moſt Bleſſed God in the Mindes, Judgments, Souls and Conſciences of Men, as amiable and lovely, as attractive of their hearts and affections, as worthy to be delighted in, to be depended on, by all Perſons of Mankinde, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any, for all, and all manner of good, temporal, ſpiritual, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, I am not much afraid to make it the arbitrement of thoſe, that dare ſo much as pretend to ingenuity, fairneſs, and freedom of ſpirit, amongſt our Adverſaries themſelves.</p>
            <p>If it be here replyed, and ſaid, that our Doctrine alſo repreſenteth God, as<note place="margin">§. 14. <hi>Object. 1.</hi>
               </note> irreverſibly engaged, and this from Eternity, upon the ſame deſtruction or puniſhment, and this of the ſame numbers of men, with the other; in as much as it granteth, or ſuppoſeth, that God from Eternity unchangeably purpoſed the eternal Deſtruction of all thoſe without exception, that ſhall remain finally impenitent and unbeleeving, which are the ſame men, both for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and perſonality, which the other Doctrine (ſo much oppoſed by us) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth as the Objects of thoſe unalterable reprobating Purpoſes or Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of His from Eternity: and conſequently, that the one Doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth God as little lovely, or deſirable unto his Creature, as the other; To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though the Doctrine aſſerted by us, ſuppoſeth ſuch a Decree in God <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> from Eternity, whereby all Perſons that ſhould remain finally impenitent and unbeleeving, are decreed, or adjudged, unto the vengeance of <hi>eternal fire,</hi> yet doth it not adjudg to this account, any ſuch, who either through defect of years, as Children dying Infants, or defectiveneſs in diſcretion otherwiſe, are not capable of Faith, or Repentance: (of which we have already, in part,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:94900:258"/> given an account <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 6. Sect. 18, 19, &amp;c.</note>, and ſhall, God willing, account more fully in the latter part of this Diſcourſe.) Whereas the Doctrine impugned by us, includeth as well Infants of days, as Defectives of years (eſpecially the former) in that Decree of Reprobation, which it notioneth in God. So that this Doctrine doth at no hand engage God ſo deep in the Blood of Mankinde, as the other: and conſequently in this reſpect rendereth Him unto His Creature far more gracious, lovely, and deſirable, then the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Doctrine we plead, though it ſets the face of Gods Reprobating Decree againſt all finally impenitent and unbeleeving, and ſo materially, and in a conſequential way, againſt the ſame Perſons (capable of impenitency) which the other Doctrine ſubjecteth unto it; Yet, 1. It ſubjecteth no Perſon of Mankinde, as ſuch, or by Name, unto it, but ſuppoſeth all Men, as Men, in a capacity, and under a fair poſſibility, of being Elected, this Decree of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation notwithſtanding; though it concludeth from many Prophetical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures otherwiſe, that a very great number of Men will in time be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated for their Wickedneſs and Unbelief: whereas the Doctrine oppoſed bends this Decree againſt the Perſons of Men perſonally conſidered, and ſo leaveth ſuch and ſuch Men, from firſt to laſt, irrecoverably doomed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. 2. The Doctrine aſſerted by us, preſenteth God in His Decree of Reprobation, as truly and really intending the Salvation of Men, as in His Decree of Election it ſelf. Yea and queſtioneth not, but that His Decree of Reprobation, according to His gracious Purpoſe and Intendment therein, hath occaſioned, and doth occaſion dayly, the Salvation of many. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Intent of the Law, threatening ſuch and ſuch Malefactors, as Traytors, Murtherers, &amp;c. with Death, is not to take away the lives of ſuch Perſons, who ſhall commit theſe foul crimes and miſdemeanors, by Death, (this is but the ſubordinate intention, or end, of it,) but to prevent the perpetration of theſe crimes in all that live under this Law, and conſequently, their ſuffering of Death for them. Much leſs is it any part of the Intent of ſuch a Law, to make any Perſon, or Perſons by Name, Traytors, Murtherers, or the like, that ſo they may be cut off by Death. In like manner, we judg and teach, that the ſoveraign and primary Intent of this Decree of God, <hi>He (i. e.</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever) <hi>beleeveth not, ſhall be damned</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mark 16. 16</note>, beſides which, in reſpect of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and import of it (which may be expreſſed in other terms) we finde no Decree of Reprobation in God mentioned, no nor yet ſo much as intimated, in the Scriptures, is not to bring Damnation upon thoſe who ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, much leſs to expoſe any man, or numbers of men, to an unavoydable neceſſity of a non-beleeving, that ſo they may be damned, but to prevent the ſin of Unbelief in all Men, in order to their Non-damnation, and that they may be ſaved. 3. (And laſtly) The Doctrine which avoucheth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all Men, clearly reſolveth the Reprobation of all that are, or ever come to be, Reprobated, into themſelves, or their own voluntary and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate courſe of ſinning, or perſiſting in Unbelief, as the cauſe thereof; and ſo fairly diſchargeth God, and His Decree, as no ways acceſſary unto it: Whereas the adverſe Opinion, reſolveth it into the meer Pleaſure or peremptory Will of God in His Decree of Reprobation, affirming this to be the principal, if not the ſole and adequate, cauſe of it. So that there is a very vaſt difference between the one Opinion and the other, in their reſpective repreſentations of God unto his Creature, in point of Grace, Goodneſs, and Lovelineſs on the one hand, as of Rigor, Hardneſs, and Unlovelineſs on the other hand. It is true, God is very ſevere, terrible, and unrelenting, in the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:94900:259"/> Execution of His Penal Decrees, upon thoſe, who voluntarily expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the doom and dint of them; in which reſpect the Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth oft of His Severity: but in the framing of them, His Primary Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were (as hath been ſaid) gracious, no ways inconſiſtent with, or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to, the Peace and Comfort of any of His Creatures; but calculated with dueneſs of proportion and reſpects, for the advancement of them. Yet,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againſt the main Argument laſt inſiſted upon, it may be further object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;<note place="margin">§. 15. <hi>Object. 2.</hi>
               </note> They who deny that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for any, but for the Elect only, repreſent God altogether as gracious and lovely unto His Creature, as they, who affirm that He dyed for all. Becauſe the former hold and teach withall, that God really intends that all thoſe, for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed, ſhall be actually ſaved hereby: Whereas the latter hold, that though <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all, yet He dyed onely ſo, or upon ſuch terms for them, that notwithſtanding His dying for them, they may all periſh. Now doth it not argue as much, or more, grace and goodneſs in God, to provide certainly, and above all poſſibility of miſcarrying, for the Salvation of a few, then to provide a bare poſſibility onely of Salvation for all; or for the Salvation of all after ſuch a manner, and upon ſuch terms onely, that all, notwithſtanding this Proviſion made for them, may very poſſibly periſh? To this alſo I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they who teach that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all Men, do not teach, that <label type="milestone">

               </label> He dyed to make Proviſion onely for a bare Poſſibility that all may be ſaved, but ſuch a Proviſion which is fully and richly ſufficient for the Salvation of all Men; yea ſo ſufficient, that all Men, if they be not intolerably and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſably negligent and careleſs in a matter of ſo tranſcendent a concernment unto them, may, and moſt certainly ſhall, be ſaved. The Proviſion which God hath made by the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the Salvation of all, is ſo redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly plentiful, that there is no place, or poſſibility left for the miſcarrying of any man, but by a neglect of it onely.—<hi>How ſhall we eſcape</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>if we</hi> NEGLECT <hi>ſo great a Salvation</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Hebr. 2. 3</note>? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> clearly implying, that if they did not <hi>neglect</hi> it, but ſeriouſly and diligently minde and look after it, they ſhould <hi>eſcape [viz.</hi> the Wrath of God, and the vengeance of Hell fire,] and conſequently, be ſaved. Otherwiſe, in caſe their regarding or eſteeming of this <hi>Salvation,</hi> ſhould be accompanied with the ſame danger, or deſtruction, which their <hi>neglect</hi> would bring upon them, the Apoſtle might as well, or (indeed) rather, have ſaid, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape,</hi> whether we <hi>neglect this great Salvation,</hi> or no?</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no compariſon, for matter of grace, goodneſs, or bounty, between ſuch a Proviſion for the Salvation of all Men without exception, whereby all, and every Perſon, may, if they be not wilfully bent upon their own deſtruction, be ſaved; and between ſuch, whereby there is no poſſibility, ſave only for a few, a number inconſiderable, compared with the whole, to be ſaved. Nor is that certainty, or neceſſity, of the Salvation of a few, which is pretended to be conſulted, or intended, in this latter Proviſion, being accompanied with the expoſure of ſo many millions of millions of precious Souls to inevitable Damnation, any ways conſiderable, in point of Grace, with that great and Bleſſed Opportunity which by the former Proviſion is put into the hand of the World, and of every Perſon of Mankinde without exception, to eſcape the vengeance which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Suppoſe a man had a thouſand quarters of Wheat, or the like, which he knows not what to do with, or to what uſe to convert it, but onely to the relief of a company of poor indigent creatures ready to be affamiſhed and periſh through hunger: in caſe this man ſhould actually relieve onely two or three Perſons in this diſtreſs with part of this abundance, there being a thouſand before him in the ſame extremity, and in no poſſibility of being relieved from any other hand; but ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to caſt the reſidue of his grain into the Sea, or bury it under ground, or ſome ways or other deſtroy the ſerviceableneſs of it unto man, then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it towards the relief of any of the reſt, would not ſuch an act as this, by reaſon of the unnaturalneſs, and affectate unmercifulneſs of it, quite drown the grace and lovelineſs of his Charity in relieving thoſe few?

            <p>At this turn it is commonly pleaded, that God is no Debtor to any of His<note place="margin">§. 16. <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> Creatures; and conſequently that He is, and was, at perfect liberty, whether He would ſhew Mercy unto any, or make Proviſion for the Salvation of the ſmalleſt number of all. Upon which account, it could not have been termed an Act of unmercifulneſs in Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in caſe no Proviſion had been made by him for the Salvation of any, much leſs, that He ſhould not make Proviſion for all. As it argues no unmercifulneſs at all in Him, that He hath made no Proviſion at all for the Salvation of the Devils, becauſe He was no ways bound to it. Whereas upon Men, in caſe they have means and opportunity to relieve the neceſſities of thoſe that are in miſery, and neglect to do it, the imputation and charge of unmercifulneſs juſtly lieth, becauſe they are under a Law in this behalf. So that the Grace of God in his merciful Proviſion for the Salvation of a few, is no ways obſcured, or diſparaged by his non-providing for all. To all this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That neither the Argument yet in hand, nor the Anſwer given to the <label type="milestone">

<pb n="482" facs="tcp:94900:260"/> with the hardening of Himſelf againſt, and neglect of all the reſt, being incomparably far the greater number, in their greateſt extremity. And this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (I ſuppoſe) we have made good againſt all rational contradiction. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas we reflected upon ſuch an Act, which our Adverſaries ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to be in God, whereby they ſay, notwithſtanding a ſufficiency of merit before Him in the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the Salvation of all, as well as of a few, yet He rather ſuffered this precious ſufficiency (in reſpect of the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of it over and above the Proviſion made by it for a few) to vaniſh, or be ſpilt, then to intend any help or healing by it unto the generality of Men; whereas (I ſay) we cenſured ſuch an Act as this, as ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſiſting with, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuring the beauty and lovelineſs of that gracious Act of God in providing for the Salvation of a few, we did not herein reflect prejudice in the leaſt upon any liberty, or rightfulneſs of Power, truly competent unto, or veſted in, God, but onely ſhewed and aſſerted the deformity, or moral contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, between two Acts, which notwithſtanding our Adverſaries aſcribe, as well the one, as the other, unto God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Concerning that liberty of ſhewing, and denying, Mercy, where, and to whom He pleaſeth, which the Objection in hand aſſerteth unto God, we anſwer; that how abſolute ſoever this liberty in Him may be conceived to be, ſimply, or in reſpect of any engagement from Men, or any Creature, Yet 1. it is confined and ſubjected unto ſuch Declarations, and Promiſes, which Himſelf hath freely made: ſo that (for example) He is no more at liberty, nor hath He any more right of Power to withhold, or deny, Mercy from, and unto, any of thoſe, to whom He hath promiſed Mercy, or to whom He hath Declared that He will ſhew Mercy, however otherwiſe they may ſeem unworthy or unmeet Objects of Mercy; He hath no more liberty (I ſay) to do either of theſe, then He hath to lye, deal unfaithfully, unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the like. Upon this account the Prophet <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth it unto God, as a ſignal engagement upon him, to praiſe and worſhip Him, that He <hi>had</hi> [ſtill] <hi>magnified His Word above all His Name</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 138. 2</note>; meaning, that what ever Attribute of His (which is, either in whole, or in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>art, His <hi>Name</hi>) at any time ſeemed to oppoſe or ſtand up againſt the performance of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or Declaration of Mercy made by Him, yet he always <hi>magnified</hi> his Promiſe, by giving real, full, and ſeaſonable performance thereunto: He paſſeth not for the vailing or obſcuring any other part of his Name, ſo that his Truth and Faithfulneſs in his Word may be advanced. 2. As he hath no liberty (as ſome men count liberty) of ſhewing, or denying Mercy, contrary to his <hi>Word,</hi> ſo neither hath he any liberty of acting in one kinde or other, [and conſequently neither of ſhewing, or denying, Mercy] in oppoſition to his Wiſdom, which is (as it were) the ſteerage of all his Diſpenſations in one kinde or other, according to that of the Apoſtle formerly conſidered <note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 4. Sect. 36</note>, <hi>Who worketh all things</hi> ACCORDING TO THE COVNSEL <hi>of His Will</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 1. 11</note>: <hi>i. e.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exigency or requirement of that moſt abſolute, infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his, by which his <hi>Will</hi> [and conſequently his Power, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exerted, and moved into action, by, and according to his <hi>Will</hi>] is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and led forth in all the movings and actings of it. In ſo much that (as we lately argued, and proved <note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 16 Sect. 15</note>) God is at far leſs liberty to decline, in any his ways and actions, the moſt diſtrict Rules and Principles of the moſt accurate Wiſdom that is, then any Creature whatſoever, Man, or Angel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conceit or plead for ſuch a liberty in God of ſhewing, and denying,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:94900:260"/> Mercy, to whom he pleaſeth, which is inconſiſtent with that determination of himſelf in either kinde, which He hath declared in his Word, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and ſpeak unworthily of him; yea and to ſhake the foundations of that Hope, upon which the Saints and ſound Beleevers are built by the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> For if God be at liberty to deny Mercy, contrary to his Word, or Will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed therein, what aſſurance can the beſt Beleevers have that they either are, or ſhall be juſtified, or ſaved, by Him? So that until our Adverſaries have firſt proved, that God hath made no ſuch Declaration in the Goſpel, as that He hath made, and is ſtill willing to make, Proviſion for the Salvation of all Men without exception, by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (which hitherto they have not done) it is in vain for them to pretend a liberty in Him of denying Mercy to whom He pleaſeth, by way of proof or confirmation of their Opinion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though it would have been no Act of unmercifulneſs in God, but of<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> diſtrictneſs of Juſtice onely, in caſe no Proviſion had been made by Him, either by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or otherwiſe, for the Salvation of any, yet ſuch an Act as this would not have rendered Him ſo gracious and lovely in the eyes of his Creature, or ſo attractive of their Hearts and Souls, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not ſo Evangelical, as that Act of Grace hath now done, and doth, whereby He hath made that bleſſed Proviſion for them. And if a Providing for the Salvation of ſome, doth (in the Judgment of our Adverſaries) render Him more Gracious and Evangelical, then ſuch an Act, or courſe, would have done, whereby He had refuſed to make this Proviſion for any at all; certainly the greater the number ſhall be ſuppoſed, for whom this gracious Proviſion is made by Him, ſo much the greater, and more Evangelical muſt that Act of Grace neceſſarily be, by which ſuch Proviſion is made. And in caſe God had provided (whether by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or in any other way) but for the Salvation of one Man onely, and had left the whole Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> (this one man excepted) to have periſhed everlaſtingly, it could be looked upon but onely as ſuch an Act of Grace, which is next to none at all, and wherein little of that Evangelical Spirit, which abounds and reigns in God, could have been diſcovered, yea and would (doubtleſs) commend it ſelf unto the intelligent Creature, leſs for Wiſdom, then for Grace. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, the fewer or ſmaller number they are ſuppoſed to be, for whom Proviſion of Salvation is now made by God, the leſſer, and more contracted, and ſo the leſs Evangelical, muſt that Grace needs be concluded to be, by which this Proviſion is ſuppoſed to be made. For what proportion, one, or a ſingle perſon, beareth unto thoſe few, whoſe Salvation is (in the ſence of our Adverſaries) now provided for by God; the ſame do theſe few bear unto all, or unto the whole body of Mankinde. Therefore if they judg that God ſheweth more Grace in providing for the Salvation of that number of men, which they call the <hi>Elect,</hi> then He ſhould have done in providing for one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this number onely; they have Reaſon to judg alſo, in caſe God maketh this Proviſion, not onely for their ſmall number of Elect, but for them, and all others with them, that He ſheweth far more Grace in ſuch a Proviſion, as this, then in that, which their Doctrine confineth Him unto.</p>
            <p>Nor doth it from theſe debates any ways follow, that in caſe God had made<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> Proviſion for the Salvation of the Devils, He ſhould have manifeſted more Grace, or Evangelicalneſs of Spirit, then now (according to our Principles) he hath done, in providing Salvation for Men onely (though for all Men,) although (it is true) the number of thoſe, for whom Proviſion of Salvation
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:94900:261"/> ſhould have been made in this caſe, had been greater, then now we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be. The Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Grace,</hi> eſpecially <hi>divine Grace,</hi> is not to be meaſured or judged of ſimply or meerly by any beneficialneſs accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Creature of one kinde, or other, but by a beneficialneſs accruing in an honorable and prudential way, in reſpect of him, from whom, or by whom, this beneficialneſs is ſuppoſed to accrue. Acts of Prodigality are, or may be, beneficial to the Receivers of what is thereby given, yet are they no Acts of <hi>Grace:</hi> nor would it be any Act of <hi>Grace</hi> in a Judg, to ſpare the life of a Murtherer, or Traytor, though this Act of his, in the nature of it, is beneficial to him, whoſe life is ſpared, and may poſſibly turn to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit unto him. The Reaſon why theſe, and ſuch like Acts as theſe, though they may be very beneficial to their Objects reſpectively, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding not to be reputed Acts of <hi>Grace,</hi> becauſe <hi>Grace</hi> imports ſuch a Principle which is every ways regular, and ſavory; and as comely and honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the fruits and actings of it, unto him in whom it reſides, as beneficial, helpful, or refreſhing unto others: whereas Prodigality, and ſo Injuſtice, or Inconſiderateneſs in a Judg, though beneficial unto many, are yet unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Principles, and juſtly diſhonorable unto their Subjects. So then, in caſe it were not, or be not, well conſiſting with the Principles of true, and divine Wiſdom, and ſo would not have been truly honorable unto <hi>God</hi> to make Proviſion for the Salvation of the Devils, the making of this Proviſion for them would not have been any matter of <hi>Grace</hi> in him: and conſequently, upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, he ſhould have been never the more gracious, though in making Proviſion for Salvation, he ſhould have taken the Devils into part and fellowſhip with Men. And that it is no ways conſiſtent with his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Honor, to ſpread a Table of Salvation before the Devils, as he hath done for Men, may by this clear Argument (<hi>a poſteriori</hi>) be evinced, <hi>viz.</hi> that he hath not done it; it being reaſonable in the higheſt to conceive, that <hi>God</hi> never was, never will be, wanting to himſelf in point of honor, or glory.

Which diſtance imports a ſignal inconſiſtency with, or repugnancy unto, his Wiſdom, Honor, and glory. How, or in what conſideration, or reſpect, the providing for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the fallen Angels, or Devils, is, or would have been, repugnant to the Wiſdom, and ſo no ways conſiſtent with the honor, of <hi>God,</hi> is (haply) not unworthy a ſober enquiry. But becauſe it is ſomewhat eccentrical to the main buſineſs in hand, and the body of our Diſcourſe begins to ſwell to an unacceptable bulk already, we ſhall decline the pertractation of it, at preſent; onely offering to conſideration, whether their prodigious unnaturalneſs, or height of miſdemeanor in ſinning, above what is to be found in the ſin of Men, either as ſinning in <hi>Adam,</hi> or by actual and perſonal perpetrations (ordinarily) may not upon a very reaſonable account be deemed the Cauſe or Reaſon, why it was not honorable for <hi>God,</hi> or of any good conſiſtence with his Holineſs, or Wiſdom, to ſtretch forth an hand of Grace, or of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto them. We ſee in the caſe of men themſelves, that, if they ſin with an high hand, eſpecially after any conſiderable means of Grace vouchſafed, and turn head upon the light which hath ſhone clearly to them, or upon the
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:94900:261"/> ways of Holineſs, wherein they have ſometimes walked, that God <hi>taketh no pleaſure in them, i. e.</hi> that they are an abhorring to his Soul: and that againſt all ſuch men, who ſhall commit that moſt hideous and enormous ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>He hath</hi> as good as <hi>ſworn in His Wrath that they ſhall never enter into His</hi> eternal <hi>Reſt.</hi> Now if God judgeth it a matter unbecoming His Grace, Holineſs, or Wiſdom, and no ways conſiſtent with his Honor, to impart of that Salvation, which He hath provided in <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Men, unto thoſe for whom it was provided, in caſe their miſdemeanor in ſinning ſhall riſe to ſuch an height, as hath been mentioned, and as a total and perſevering Apoſtacy importeth; can it ſeem any ways improbable, the Devils having deſperately apoſtatized from a far greater light, from a richer and more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible experience of the Grace, Love, and Bounty of God, then Apoſtates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men lightly can do, that his Soul ſhould ſo far abominate them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſuch their ſtupendious Apoſtacy, as to judg it altogether unmeet for him, unworthy that <hi>inacceſsible Light</hi> of Wiſdom, Grace, Holineſs, and Glory <hi>wherein He dwelleth,</hi> to conceive ſo much as a thought within him in order to their Salvation?

Art. 2.</note>, it is a conſideration of ſtrength enough alone to carry the buſineſs under enquiry clear before it. For if this be an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential property of their Natures, not to be in any capacity of changing, when once they have choſen, it follows at once, that having now choſen Apoſtacy and Defection from God, they are by their own Act irrecoverably, and againſt all poſſibility of Redemption, concluded under Sin and Miſery for ever. And if this were the frame, and condition of their Natures, and themſelves conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and privy to it, (and conſcious doubtleſs they were to the Law and terms of their own Creation) it renders their ſin unmeaſurably ſinful and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, above the ſinfulneſs of the Sin, or ſins, of Men. For though <hi>Adam</hi> (and ſo all Men in him) knew not, in caſe he did or ſhould ſin, whether he ſhould obtain from God the Grace of a Redeemer, or no, yet neither did he know the contrary, but knew that he was capable of Redemption; ſo that though his ſin was exceeding great in many conſiderations otherwiſe, yet in this behalf it was the more rational, and ſo the more pardonable and excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>viz.</hi> that he knew himſelf in a capacity of being reſtored. Whereas the Angels, in caſe they underſtood the inflexibility of their Wills after an Election, and conſequently that they were ſimply and abſolutely unredeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able after ſinning, and yet preſumed to ſin, muſt needs be the more irrati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>onal,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:94900:262"/> and ſo the more inſufferable and inexcuſable in their ſin. But whether this Doctrine of the School, concerning the <hi>unchangeableneſs</hi> of the Wills of Angels, after their firſt determination, be ſquare and ſtable, or no, I am (at preſent) in a fitter poſture to query, then determine. Onely herein my thoughts are all made, that the Wills, of both ſorts of Angels, as well of thoſe who at firſt choſe Righteouſneſs, as of thoſe who made a choyce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hereunto, remain to this day <hi>unchanged;</hi> the one, in their adherency to the good, the other, to the evil, which they choſe reſpectively in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But this <hi>unchangedneſs,</hi> doth not neceſſarily flow from any <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi> in either of them; but may, in the former, ariſe from the native li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their Wills, which as they had Power at firſt to chuſe that which was good; ſo have they Power, and this with enlargement by means of the ſenſible experience they gain continually of the ſweetneſs of the good cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by them, to perſevere in this their choyce: and in the latter, partly from the juſt Judgment of God denounced againſt them, and made fully known to them, <hi>viz.</hi> that He will upon no terms whatſoever be reconciled unto them, to the days of Eternity; partly alſo from his abſolute and total withdrawing of his Spirit of Grace from them. Nor do I apprehend any thing conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to oppoſe my Belief, but that they will, both the one, and the other of them, remain upon the ſame terms unchanged to the days of Eternity. Yet were I to build, I had rather chuſe the former of theſe for my foundation: becauſe I conceive Scripture-evidence more pregnant and clear for it. To ſay, that the Will of a Creature ſhould, and will, remain <hi>unchanged</hi> in that which is good, is no elevation of it above that ſphere of excellency, which is made for it to move in: but to affirm that at any time it is, or ever will be, thus UNCHANGEABLE, is to make it a Companion of his, who in the height of his Pride ſaid, <hi>Ero ſimilis Altiſsimo,</hi> I will be like unto the Moſt High.</p>
            <p>But concerning the unredeemableneſs of the Devils, I much rather approve<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> another Reaſon, which the forementioned Authors (the Schoolmen) give of it. <hi>Diabolus</hi> (ſay they) <hi>peccavit in termino: Homo, in via:</hi> i. e. <hi>The Devil ſinned, being at his journeys end: Man ſinned</hi> [onely] <hi>by the way.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the Devil ſinned in an eſtate of perfect Bleſſedneſs, under a full fruition of <hi>God;</hi> in which reſpect, his Sin was provoking in the higheſt. Whereas Man, when he ſinned, was but in his progreſs towards ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and was not as yet poſſeſſed of it: and in this reſpect, ſinned, though at a very high rate of provocation, his ſin ſimply conſidered, yet at a far lower rate then the Devil, becauſe againſt a far lower Light, and leſs <hi>Grace</hi> Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But of this enough, if not more then enough, our main buſineſs being no more intereſſed in it, then we formerly intimated it to be. Nor did the difficulty layd in our way, exact of us any thing more, then onely to prove, that it had been no Act of <hi>Grace</hi> in <hi>God</hi> to provide for the Salvation of the Devil; which (I ſuppoſe) hath been done with meaſure heaped up.

            <p n="5">5. (And laſtly) To the Plea made for a liberty in <hi>God,</hi> to ſhew, and to deny Mercy, as, and to whom, he pleaſeth, I anſwer yet further; that in caſe it be found a thing utterly and clearly inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom of <hi>God,</hi> or with the goodneſs and graciouſneſs of his Nature, having provided means of Salvation, as ſufficient and proper for the Salvation of all, as of a few, (which our Adverſaries, neither do, nor with any face of Reaſon, can, deny) to limit himſelf in the conſignment, or deſignment, of them, to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:94900:262"/> of a few, with a diſſerviceabling of them as to all the reſt, then hath he no liberty to confine or limit himſelf after any ſuch manner, nor to evacuate the uſefulneſs or beneficialneſs of theſe means in reſpect of the generality of Men. This conſequence hath been ſufficiently argued and proved already: and however, is of it ſelf lightſom enough to make every denyer, yea or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioner of it, aſhamed. Therefore I aſſume: For <hi>God</hi> to limit himſelf in the conſignment of thoſe means of Salvation, unto a few, which He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a ſufficiency and aptneſs for the Salvation of all, or to diſ-intend the Salvation of the greateſt part of Men by them, is a thing clearly and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom of God, and graciouſneſs of His Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therefore He hath no <hi>liberty</hi> in the caſe ſpecified, to <hi>ſtraiten</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within the narrow bounds of ſuch a conſignment, as that mentioned. In this Argument we ſuppoſe, and take for granted, that the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a means as ſufficient for the Salvation of all Men, and as proper and meet for the Salvation of all, as of a few. And in this (I preſume) we have no Adverſary; or however, the generality of thoſe, who are Adverſaries in the main of the Controverſie depending, accord with us therein. The Reaſon of the aſſumption (in the Argument now propounded) is (as to the former part of it) becauſe it is notoriouſly repugnant to the Principles of ſound Wiſdom, to make waſte of any thing, which is ſerviceable or uſeful for any honorable or worthy end and purpoſe: And the more precious and difficult of procurement a Means is, the more honorable and excellent, the end or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is, for which it is appropriately and peculiarly ſerviceable, the more repugnant it is to all Principles of Wiſdom, to ſacrifice it upon the ſervice of vanity, and to do nothing with it at all. Now (queſtionleſs) the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is a means moſt choyce and precious; not another of like preciouſneſs, efficacy, or worth to be procured, or levyed by God himſelf: the end for which this Death of Chriſt is moſt appropriately ſerviceable, is the Salvation of the whole World, which is an end moſt honorable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Therefore it muſt needs be notoriouſly inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom of God to diſpoſe of this means onely in order to the procurement and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an end far leſs honorable, as namely the Salvation of a few: the ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taining whereof the excellent worth and weight of the ſaid means doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably over-ponderate and tranſcend. So that a non-diſpoſal of it to wards the obtaining of the juſt and adequate end, for which it is appropriately uſeful and ſerviceable, is to evacuate and make uſeleſs, though not in whole, yet in part, the ſuper-tranſcendent excellency, worth, and vertue thereof. But of this lately.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of the latter part of the ſaid Aſſumption, is, becauſe it is<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> every whit as repugnant to the Nature of Grace, Goodneſs and Bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Diſpoſition, not to relieve the miſerable, who are every ways capable of relief, and this with Honor to Him that ſhall relieve them, when a man hath abundantly in his hand wherewith to relieve them, eſpecially when withall he hath no other end or uſe, whereunto to diſpoſe what he hath in this kinde, but onely towards the relief of ſuch Perſons. And as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> argueth, and demandeth, concerning men; <hi>Whoſoever hath this Worlds</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 3. 17</note> 
               <hi>good, and ſeeth His Brother hath need, and ſhutteth up His Compaſsion from Him, how dwelleth the Love of God in Him?</hi> in like manner we may well rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and demand concerning God; If God, having the good of the World to come, means of Salvation for his poor loſt Creature, Man, and yet ſhutteth up his Compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the Love of Man in him? And
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:94900:263"/> yet the Scripture (as we formerly heard) ſpeaketh very excellent and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things of His Love unto Men, no where confining it within the narrow circle, or ſphere of the Elect, or ſome few Particulars. Nor (indeed) can He, with any congruity of expreſſion, be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Lover of Men, [or, of Mankinde] in caſe He loveth ſome few particular men onely: as He is no where in Scripture called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Lover of Angels, although He loves a very conſiderble number of this kinde of Creature, (as <hi>viz.</hi> all His Elect, or Holy Angels) becauſe He loveth not all Particulars. But of this more largely in the Premiſſes <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 16 §. 3, 4, &amp;c.</note>. To the point in hand; Certain it is, 1. That God hath no other uſe, or occaſion of contrivement, of the Death of Chriſt, ſave onely for, and in order towards, the glorifying of himſelf, in, and by, the Salvation of Men; or at leaſt none other, but what would be as effectually promoted, and attained by it, though it ſhould be intended by Him for the Salvation of the generality of Men. 2. That this Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is every whit as proper, and as ſufficient, a means to bleſs the whole generation of Mankinde with Salvation, as thoſe few, whom our Adverſaries ſuppoſe to be onely bleſſed by it in this kinde. 3. That it would be no ways diſhonorable unto God, nor of any harder conſiſtence, with his Juſtice, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Hatred of Sin, or with any other of his Attributes whatſoever, to intend the Salvation of any others, or of all Men, by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then it is to intend the Salvation of thoſe few, whom our Adverſaries grant to be the Objects of his Intentions in this kinde. 4. That the generality of Men, or thoſe, whoſe Salvation our Adverſaries ſuppoſe, not to be intended by God, in, or by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are every whit as miſerable, and ſtand altogether in as much need of Salvation, as thoſe, whoſe Salvation they ſuppoſe to have been intended thereby. By the light of theſe grounds layd together, it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, that it is a thing ſignally inconſiſtent with the Grace, Goodneſs, Mercy, Bounty of the Divine Nature, or Being, to conſign the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Salvation onely of a few, and to ſuffer the far greateſt part of Men, being in every reſpect as ſalvable, and this by the ſame means, and with the ſame proportion to any end whatſoever, as they, to remain miſerable, and periſh everlaſtingly, for want of a like conſignment unto them for the ſame end.</p>
            <p>To reply and ſay, that God gains the manifeſtation of his Soveraignty, or Prerogative of ſhewing Mercy, and denying Mercy, to whom He pleaſeth, by intending the Salvation onely of a few, which He could not have gained by intending the Salvation of all; is to flee to a polluted Sanctuary, and which hath been in this very Chapter (and formerly <note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 4. Sect. 36, 37, &amp;c.</note>) raz'd to the ground, and not ſo much as one ſtone thereof left upon another, that hath not been thrown down.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all Men without exception of any, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate<note place="margin">§. 21. <hi>Argum. 6.</hi>
               </note> further, by the light of this Argument. <hi>That Doctrine, whoſe tenor, frame, and import, are of a direct and clear tendency to promote, and advance Godlineſs amongst Men, is</hi> (queſtionleſs) <hi>Evangelical, and the Truth. But ſuch is the tenor, frame, and import of that Doctrine, which teacheth, that Chriſt dyed for all Men without exception. Therefore</hi> (queſtionleſs) <hi>this Doctrine is Evangelical, and none other but the Truth.</hi> The Major Propoſition in this Argument, needeth no more proof, then the Sun needs a Candle whereby to be ſeen, when he ſhineth in his might. Yet if a proof be required, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes in this Diſcourſe will afford it liberally <note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 12. ſect. 1. 20. &amp; Cap. 11. Sect. 26</note>, where we opened that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal character, or deſcription of the Goſpel, delivered by the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1.
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:94900:263"/> where he calls it, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>d advancement of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> in the World (as we formerly interpreted.) So that what particular Doctrine ſoever is found to be of the ſame tendency, muſt of neceſſity be a member of the ſame body, a branch of the ſame Truth; or however, clearly and fairly comporting with it, and ſo a Truth. For there is nothing accordable with Truth, but Truth.</p>
            <p>The truth of the Minor Propoſition alſo hath been ſet before the Reader in a clear and perfect light, in the precedure of this Diſcourſe <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 16 §. 7, 8, &amp;c.</note>, where we evinced above contradiction, that the Doctrine of our Adverſaries, aſſerting onely a limited Redemption by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> leaveth no Hope at all, or at moſt but a very cold, feeble, and faint Hope, to any <hi>ungodly,</hi> or unregenerate man, of being ſaved by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and conſequently hath nothing in it much quickening or provoking unto <hi>Godlineſs</hi> (at leaſt in reſpect of ſuch Perſons, who are, at preſent, <hi>ungodly,</hi> who are the far greateſt part of the World) but is full of a ſpirit of antipathy, and oppoſition hereunto; in as much as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is of a deſtructive, or diſcouraging import to any mans Hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, upon endevors, is obſtructive and quenching to theſe endevors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Whereas the ſpirit and <hi>genius</hi> of the Doctrine maintained by us, is to fill all Men whatſoever with the richeſt and greateſt aſſurance of Hope they can deſire, that upon their diligent and faithful endevors to Repent and to Beleeve, Repentance and Faith ſhall be given unto them by God: and that upon the like endevors to perſevere in a courſe of Repenting, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, they ſhall have Perſeverance alſo given, and ſo in the end be unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably ſaved.</p>
            <p>What is commonly alledged in defence of the Doctrine of limited Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, againſt the Argument now propounded, hath been fully anſwered in the place laſt referred unto, together with whatſoever (I conceive) can lightly be alledged further upon the ſame account. If I were conſcious unto, or could ſuſpect any thing, that with any competent ſhew of probability might be yet objected to the diſabling of the force of the ſaid Argument, I call God for a record upon my Soul, that I would not conceal or diſſemble it, out of any indulgence to mine own Opinion. This (in brief) for my ſixth Argument.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>If Chriſt dyed for the Elect onely, and not for all, and every Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 22. <hi>Argum. 7.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>then will there no man be found culpable of Judgment, or liable unto Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or periſhing, for, or through, Unbelief, or for not beleeving on Chriſt for Salvation. But there are many that will be found liable to Condemnation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> yea and will be actually condemned, for their Unbelief. Ergo.</hi> The Reaſon of the Conſequence in the former Propoſition, is pregnant and clear. Firſt, The Elect will not be found liable to Condemnation for Unbelief, becauſe they (according to the Principles of our Adverſaries) ſhall be all infallibly drawn, or brought to beleeve. 2. No Reprobate can be liable to Condemnation for not beleeving on <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Salvation, becauſe he tranſgreſſeth no Law or Precept of God by ſuch his unbelief. For (doubtleſs) God commandeth no man to beleeve on <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Salvation, but onely thoſe, for whom there is Salvation in Him: as He commandeth no man to <hi>gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles.</hi> Nay His conſtant manner and method, of teaching, charging, admoniſhing, and treating with Men in other like caſes, imports, that in
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:94900:264"/> caſe there were no Salvation for Men in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> He would be ſo far from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing of charging them to beleeve on Him, that He would take them off, and diſſwade them from beleeving, or depending on Him in that kinde. For if we ſearch the Scriptures, we ſhall ſtill finde that God upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions counſelleth and chargeth men, to take heed of uncertain, empty, and vain dependencies, and to ſeek for Help, Peace, and Safety, where they are to be found. Places of this import are obvious and frequent. <hi>And Samuel ſaid unto the People, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedneſs, yet turn not aſide from following the Lord, but ſerve the Lord with all your heart: And turn ye not aſide:</hi> FOR THEN SHOVLD YE GO AFTER VAIN THINGS, WHICH CANNOT PROFIT, NOR DELIVER, <hi>for they are vain.

               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 20, 21, &amp;c.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So again: <hi>Truſt not in oppreſsion: become not vain in robbery: if riches encreaſe, ſet not your heart upon them</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 62. 10</note>. Immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſpeaking of God) he had ſaid; <hi>Truſt Him at all times: ye People, pour out your Heart before Him: God is a Refuge for us. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 23. 5</note>. So alſo: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, curſed be the man, that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord. For he ſhall be like the heath in the deſart</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Jer. 17. 5, 6</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (To omit other paſſages of like conſideration without end.) It being then the conſtant manner of God in His Addreſſments unto men, to diſſwade them from begging their bread in deſolate places, from laying out their ſilver for that which is not bread, from leaning upon broken reeds, from expecting Rain from Clouds without water, from putting their truſt in things that cannot help, or profit, &amp;c. it is at no hand to be beleeved, that He will counſel or command any man to buy <hi>gold,</hi> or <hi>white rayment</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> unleſs He knew that He had both the one and the other for them; to depend upon Him for Salvation, unleſs this great and bleſſed commodity were in his Hand ready for them. Yea it is the manner of God (and ſo of the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo) to take men off, and turn their expectations and dependencies aſide even from himſelf, in reſpect of a receiving ſuch things from Him, which He finds them inclined to expect from him, and himſelf in no poſture of minde or will to give them. Upon this account He ſpeaketh unto <hi>Jeremy</hi> thus: <hi>Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry or prayer for them, neither make interceſsion to me: for I will not hear thee</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Jer. 7. 16</note>. The emphaſis of all this variety of expreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on, <hi>pray not, lift not up cry, nor prayer, make no interceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</hi> ſtandeth (I conceive) in this; <hi>viz.</hi> to declare, that when He is fully purpoſed and reſolved not to do a thing, He would not have any thing at all, little or much in one kinde or other, done by the Creature for the obtaining of it at His hand. He expreſſeth himſelf once and again to the ſame Prophet in words of like effect, and (almoſt) of the ſame tenor <note n="f" place="margin">Jer. 11. 14 14, 11</note>. So when He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that <hi>Amaziah</hi> and the men of <hi>Judah</hi> expected and depended upon his preſence with thoſe hundred thouſand men of valor, which they had hired with a great ſum of money out of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to aſſiſt them againſt the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and He was fully purpoſed not to be preſent with them, or to proſper them in Battel, He gave knowledg unto <hi>Amaziah</hi> and thoſe with him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by an expreſs from himſelf by the hand of a Prophet, adviſed him to diſcharge this Army, which accordingly he did, and proſpered <note n="g" place="margin">2 Chron. 25 6, 7, &amp;c.</note>. In like manner, our Saviour in the Goſpel, knowing that the <hi>Scribe,</hi> who came unto him with this profeſſion, <hi>Maſter, I will follow thee whither ſoever thou goeſt</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 8. 19</note>,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:94900:264"/> expected ſome great accommodations by him in the World, quenched his expectations in this kinde, with this water caſt upon them; <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the ayr have neſts: but the Son of man hath not where to lay His Head</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 8. 20</note>. That paſſage alſo of his to his Diſciples ſavors much of the ſame ſpirit: <hi>In my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions:</hi> IF IT WERE NOT SO, I WOVLD HAVE TOLD YOV <note n="k" place="margin">John 14. 2</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Clearly implying, that his diſpoſition and ſpirit ſtood to deal clearly and plainly with them about ſuch things, which they might, and might not, expect from him: and that he would not ſuffer them to look for more from him, then what he was fully able and provided of, and withall ready and willing, to confer upon them. And it being (as we all know) the determinate Counſel, and moſt fixed Will and Purpoſe of God, not to give Salvation unto final Impenitents and Unbeleevers, he hath openly and aloud proclaimed the thing accordingly in the hearing of all the World, that Men might not be deceived, fruſtrated, or undone, by any their expectations from him in this kinde. So that we may without the leaſt regret of minde or thought conclude, that God enjoyneth no man, requireth no man to beleeve on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for Salvation, or to expect Salvation by him, but onely thoſe, for whom he hath purchaſed, or provided Salvation, and is accordingly ready and willing to give it unto them. Therefore if the Doctrine of our Adverſaries be Orthodox, which teacheth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed not for all Men, but for the Elect onely; certain it is, that none but the Elect are enjoyned by God to beleeve on him for Salvation: and conſequently, no other Perſon, who beleeveth not on him, tranſgreſſeth any Commandment of God in this his non-beleeving, and ſo cannot be liable unto any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation at all thereby, much leſs to the Condemnation of Hell. This for Proof of the Major Propoſition in the Argument laſt propoſed.</p>
            <p>The Tenor of the Minor was this; <hi>But there are many that will be found</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 23.</note> 
               <hi>liable to Condemnation, yea that will be actually condemned, for Unbelief.</hi> This Propoſition hath (I conceive) ſuch pregnant affinity with the expreſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable letter of the Scripture, that the mention of a place or two, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the point, will be proof in abundance. <hi>He that beleeveth on Him, is not condemned: but He that beleeveth not, [viz.</hi> in caſe this Son of God hath been declared, or preached unto him: for it is a non-beleeving in this caſe onely of which he here ſpeaketh,] <hi>is condemned already, becauſe He hath not beleeved in the Name of the onely begotten Son of God</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 3. 18</note>. <hi>Is condemned already; i. e.</hi> his Sin in not beleeving, is ſo notorious, and ſo provoking in the ſight of God, that it carries <hi>Condemnation</hi> (as it were) in the very face of it, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Perſon guilty, as good as condemned, before the ſentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation paſſeth from the mouth of the Judg upon him; according to the ancient ſaying,</p>

So again: <hi>He that beleeveth not, ſhall be damned</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Mark 16. 16</note>; meaning, not onely (if ſo much) for his other ſins, as for his non-beleeving; as is fully evident from other places, where the high-provokingneſs of the ſin of Unbelief in the ſight of God, is very plainly and ſignificantly aſſerted. <hi>For if the Word ſpoken by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſsion &amp; diſobedience received a juſt recompence of reward, How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation, Which at firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord</hi>

Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Argument, I do not apprehend, what, according to the Principles of our Adverſaries themſelves, can reaſonably be denyed. The Conſequence in the Propoſition oppoſeth none of theſe Principles. For (doubtleſs) none of them gainſayeth any of theſe Poſitions; Either, 1. That it is a better and more deſirable condition, to be in a capacity, or under a poſſibility of being ſaved, then to be in an utter incapacity, or under an abſolute impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obtaining this Bleſſedneſs. Or, 2. That in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> all Men were alike ſalvable, being all furniſhed with gracious abilities for the doing of the Will of God, and for the obſerving of that Law, upon the obſervation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their Life and Peace depended, even as <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf was furniſhed in this kinde, with whom all Men ſtood in one and the ſame condition. Or, 3. (and laſtly) That the generality, or far greateſt part of Mankinde, are not brought into a capacity of Salvation by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:94900:265"/> or attonement being made for their Sins by Him. They who grant theſe three Concluſions, if they be willing to be led by their own light, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtumble at the Conſequence in the Major Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Nor can I conceive wherein the Minor ſhould offend them. For it is the uncontroverted ſence of all Divines (as far as yet I underſtand) that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> is far a greater Benefactor to Mankinde, then the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was, even whileſt his innocency remained with him: and that the condition of men in general, is much better under the ſecond Covenant, the Covenant of Grace, then it was under the firſt, the Law or Covenant of Works. Nor is it at any hand worthy belief, that God ſhould put the World into a better eſtate, or poſture of well-being in the firſt Man, who <hi>was from the Earth, earthy,</hi> then in the ſecond Man, who is <hi>the Lord from Heaven:</hi> eſpecially conſidering, that it is the conſtant method of the Almighty in His Works and Diſpenſations, to begin with that which is leſs perfect, to proceed unto that which is more, and to conclude with that which is moſt perfect of all.—<hi>Firſt the blade</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>and then the ear, and after that</hi> (in the laſt place) <hi>the full corn in the ear</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="margin">Mark 4. 28</note>. And the Apoſtle tells us (in another caſe) that <hi>when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part</hi> [or, unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect] <hi>ſhall be done away</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 10</note>. So that (it ſeems) that which is <hi>perfect,</hi> is ſtill hindmoſt, in the retinue of Gods Proceedings, as <hi>Rachel</hi> and her children were in <hi>Jacobs</hi> march, when He went to meet his Brother <hi>Eſau</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Gen, 33; 2</note>. Thus <hi>God, who at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake in time paſt unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by Prophets, in theſe laſt days hath ſpoken unto us by His Son</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 1. 1, 2</note>. But the path we now ſpeak of hath been ſo much occupyed, and beaten with the feet of the Providence of the moſt wiſe God, that it is viſible enough to all the World. As to the Particular in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Grace of God abounds to the World much more in the latter, the new Covenant which He hath ſtruck with it in <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> then it did in the former Covenant made with it in <hi>Adam,</hi> appears, as in general by thoſe glorious things that are every where ſpoken of the latter Covenant, above any thing ſo much as intimated concerning the former; ſo more particularly from that Conſideration which the Apoſtle ſuggeſts unto us in this Paſſage. <hi>And not as it was by one that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo is the gift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Judgment was by one unto Condemnation: but the free gift is of many offences unto Juſtification</hi>

            <p>At what door of evaſion an eſcape can be made from the hand of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> I cannot readily imagine. If the Cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we oppoſe be any ways defenſible againſt it, it is by ſome ſuch Plea as this. The World, or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, may be ſaid to be put into a better condition by <hi>Christ,</hi> or by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, then it was by <hi>Adam,</hi> and by the Covenant of Works, in as much as a conſiderable part hereof is by <hi>Christ</hi> put into ſuch a capacity of Salvation, which ſhall certainly be actuated, and ſo a great number of men certainly ſaved; whereas in <hi>Adam,</hi> though all Men were in a capacity, or under a poſſibility of Salvation, yet this capacity was ſo narrow, weak, or remote, that there was little Hope, or probability, that any man would be ſaved by the means or advantage thereof, which accordingly (as we know) came to paſs. Now is it not better for a Family, or other Community of men, to have good aſſurance, that ſome of their members ſhall have great matters of Honor and Eſtate beſtowed upon them, though all the reſt were made uncapable of ſuch Priviledges, then to be at an uncertainty whether any one of them ſhall be preferred in this kinde, or no? To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is at no hand to be granted, that the whole ſpecies, or generality of Mankind, were in <hi>Adam</hi> inveſted only with a narrow, faint, remote capacity of Salvation, or of Happineſs. For, 1.

For who deſireth any better terms of aſſurance for his life, or eſtate, then to be able to defend and make good the one and the other againſt all aſſailants, that can poſſibly invade, or endanger them; and withall to be in a ſufficient capacity of knowing or diſcovering, when any attempt or aſſault ſhal be made upon them? Such a Security as this had all Mankinde in <hi>Adam</hi> for the perpetuation of that good and happy condition, which was their Portion from the gracious and bountiful Hand of their Creator, in the day wherein He created them. They were endued with ſtrength every ways ſufficient to withſtand all Tempters, and Temptations unto Sin, yea and were in a regular capacity to have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the approach of any temptation, and of whatſoever might endanger them; and ſo to have preſerved the unſpont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The compariſon of the Family, or Community ſpecified in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, is altogether irrelative to the caſe in hand: and beſides it demands that, as reaſonable to be granted, which is nothing leſs. For it is not better for the generality of a Family, or greater Community of men, that ſome few of the members either of the one, or the other, ſhould have the greateſt aſſurance that can be given, of the greateſt things that can be enjoyed, all the reſt of their members being left to unavoydable beggery, torment, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then that all Particulars of either ſhould be put into ſuch a capacity, and way of being all honorable and happy, that by a regular, prudent, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful behavior of themſelves, and managing the opportunities which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, there ſhould none of them miſcarry, nor fail of ſuch enjoyments. For thus the Compariſon ought to be ſtated, to make it truly repreſentative of the great buſineſs, whereof we are in travel. Now it is not better for the generality of a State, or great Commonwealth, that ſome two or three, or ſome ſmall and inconſiderable number of the members or inhabitants thereof, ſhould be great Favorites of the Prince, or of thoſe in chief place, and have Riches, Honors, Offices and places of Power heap'd upon them without end, all the reſt being made ſlaves, and deveſted of all capacity, ſo much as of any tolerable ſubſiſting in the State, then it would be, that all and every of the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:94900:267"/> ſaid members, or inhabitants, ſhould be put into an hopeful and ready way, by their regular induſtry and honeſt demeanor of themſelves, to thrive, and lift up their heads, and live like men; although in the mean time they might, either through voluntary and ſupine careleſſneſs and ſloath, or through ſome vile practices otherwiſe, deprive themſelves of ſuch Happineſs. That can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better for the generality of any Community of men, which induceth an abſolute neceſſity of extream Miſery upon the far greater part of them, though attended with all imaginable advantages to ſome few, then that which is as an effectual door opened unto them all, unto all Happineſs, although it be not ſo opened, but that they may, through a ſupine negligence, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs to their own intereſt, ſhut it againſt themſelves. That which is worſe for the greater part, cannot be better for the whole. So then our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument laſt propounded remains ſtill in full force: <hi>Christ</hi> certainly dyed for all Men; becauſe otherwiſe the World, or generality of Mankinde, ſhould have been better, and more graciouſly delt with, and provided for by God, in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> then in the ſecond.</p>
            <p>The ſame Doctrine I confirm yet further by the ſeal and warrant of this<note place="margin">§. 26. <hi>Argum. 9.</hi>
               </note> Argument. <hi>If Chriſt dyed not for all Men without exception, then no man whatſoever, in his unregenerate eſtate, ſtands bound to beleeve in Him, or to depend on Him, at leaſt with any certainty of Faith, or Hope, for Salvation. But there are many Men who in their unregenerate eſtates, ſtand bound thus to beleeve in Him, and depend upon Him; yea all Men without exception (at least all, that have not yet ſinned the ſin unpardonable) ſtand bound thus to beleeve, and thus to depend.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of the ſequel in the former Propoſition, is, becauſe no man ſtands bound to do that, which he hath not a ſufficient ground, or reaſon to do; or (to ſpeak ſomewhat more warily) for the doing of which there is no ſufficient ground or reaſon. Yea the doing of any thing upon ſuch terms (I mean, without a ſufficient ground in Reaſon for the doing it) is an act ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, ſinful, and diſpleaſing unto God. <hi>That the Soul be without Knowledg</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) it is not good: and he that haſteth with his feet, ſinneth</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Prov. 19. 2</note>. The former clauſe was rendered ſomewhat more plainly in our former Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thus: <hi>Without Knowledg, the minde is not good; i. e.</hi> though a man in what he doth, means, or intends never ſo well, yet unleſs he knows, or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, a ſufficient Reaſon or ground for what he doth, his good meaning will not juſtifie him, or make him ſinleſs in his action: according to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the latter clauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>But he that haſteth with his feet, i. e.</hi> that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder in his affections, then in his Judgment, that falls upon action, before he knows a good cauſe why and wherefore he ſo acteth, <hi>ſinneth.</hi> Upon this account our Saviour reproveth the man, that ſaluted Him by that honorable and divine Title of, <hi>Good: Why calleſt thou me, Good? there is none good, but one, which is God</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 19, 17</note>. Doubtleſs the meaning of the man, in ſtiling Him, <hi>Good,</hi> was good, and proceeded from a reverend Opinion of Him: yea in ſtiling Him, <hi>Good,</hi> he ſpake nothing but Truth (and that according to our Saviours own Principles) in as much as He was (indeed) <hi>God.</hi> Yet becauſe the man had not this knowledg of him, and ſo no ſufficient Reaſon for what he did, or ſaid, in calling Him, <hi>Good,</hi> therefore He reproveth him for ſo doing, or ſpeaking. To this Point alſo lieth that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſin</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 14, 23</note>: <hi>i. e.</hi> whatſoever a man doth, not having a ſufficient ground in Reaſon, one, or more, on which to ground a Belief, or Perſwaſion, of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it, is ſinful; <hi>viz. quoad hominem,</hi> in reſpect of the doer, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:94900:267"/> or neceſſarily, <hi>quoad rem,</hi> or in the nature of the thing it ſelf. Yea to beleeve any thing, without a ſufficient ground in Reaſon to ſatisfie or convince a man of the truth of it, the Holy Ghoſt termeth the Belief of the ſimple, or fooliſh, according to that of <hi>Solomon, The ſimple beleeveth every word</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="margin">Prov. 14. 15</note>; or (as our former Tranſlation read it) <hi>The fooliſh will beleeve every thing, [i. e.</hi> as well that, for which there is good Reaſon why it ſhould be true, as that for which there is none,] which is a laſh, looſe, and unſavory kinde of Faith, and ſuch as God reliſheth not, regardeth not, no not when the object of it, or the thing beleeved, is a Truth. For <hi>God</hi> (as the wiſe man inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us) delighteth <hi>not in fools</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 4</note>. So that if there be no ſufficient ground in Reaſon, why any unregenerate Perſon ſhould beleeve or depend on Chriſt for <hi>Salvation</hi> with certainty of Faith, moſt certain it is that he ſtands not bound in duty hereunto. Now if <hi>Christ</hi> dyed onely for the Elect, and no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſon certainly knoweth, or can know, that he is one of the Elect, it is a clear caſe that he can have no ſufficient ground in Reaſon to beleeve or depend upon Him upon ſuch terms. That no unregenerate man certainly knoweth, or can know, that he is one of the Elect, hath been proved for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and that <hi>ex abundanti; viz.</hi> where it was fully evinced, that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Perſon hath ſo much as any probable ground, whereon to judg that he is Elected.</p>
            <p>If it be objected; Yes, an unregenerate Perſon hath the Command of God to beleeve, or depend, on <hi>Christ</hi> for Salvation: and this is a ſufficient ground in Reaſon for him to do accordingly; To this I anſwer, by granting the whole Argument; but retrench, that if unregenerate Perſons have the Command of <hi>God</hi> to depend on him for Salvation, it is upon the ground late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinced <note n="u" place="margin">Sect. 22. of this Chap.</note>, above all contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is Salvation in Him for them; and conſequently, purchaſed by him for them by his Death.

               <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 24. So that this Objection rather ſtrengtheneth, then weakeneth, the Doctrine we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>The Minor Propoſition, in the Argument laſt advanced by us, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmeth (as to the exigency of our cauſe) that <hi>many unregenerate Perſons ſtand bound in duty to beleeve on Christ for Salvation,</hi> is too rich in evidence to ſtand in need of Proof. For, 1. The Scripture ſaith expreſly, that <hi>God now commandeth all men every where</hi> (and therefore unregenerate men, as well as others) <hi>to repent</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Acts 17. 30</note>: if to <hi>repent,</hi> then to <hi>beleeve</hi> alſo; in as much as there can be no ſound <hi>Repentance,</hi> ſuch as God <hi>commandeth,</hi> without Faith. And if ſo be men yet unregenerate ſtand not bound in duty, or conſcience, to beleeve on Chriſt, then is it no matter of ſin in them, to <hi>make God a lyar. For He that beleeveth not God, maketh Him a lyar, becauſe he beleeveth not the record God gave of His Son</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">1 John 5. 10</note>; meaning, that whoſoever juſtifieth, or beleeveth God in the record he hath given of his Son, muſt needs beleeve on him; <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Tenor of this <hi>Record</hi> is, that <hi>whoſoever beleeveth on Him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlasting life.</hi> Now he that beleeveth this, can no more refuſe, or forbear, to beleeve on Chriſt, then he can be content eternally to periſh, or refuſe everlaſting life, as not worthy his beleeving for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. But (doubtleſs) it is ſinful in any man to <hi>make God a lyar, [i. e.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do, or to neglect to do, any act, by the doing, or neglect whereof, God is any ways repreſented as untrue of his Word, as he is by any mans non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving on <hi>Christ,</hi>] and conſequently every man (except the before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) ſtands bound in duty and conſcience to beleeve on <hi>Christ.</hi> Again,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:94900:268"/> ſecondly, If no unregenerate men had any band of Duty or Precept from God lying upon them, to beleeve on <hi>Christ,</hi> whoſoever of this ſort of men ſhould at any time beleeve on Him, ſhould ſuper-erogate, and do more then what he is by God commanded to do: and conſequently, all Beleevers, without exception, ſhould be Super-erogators, in their firſt act of Beleeving, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe until now they were unregenerate Perſons. But the Proof of this Propoſition is (I ſuppoſe) ſuper-erogatory, and more then any dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or doubtfulneſs in it, yea and (haply) more then our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themſelves, require. Therefore we paſs on to another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If God intended not the Death of Chriſt for all Men, and that in order to their</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 27. <hi>Argum. 10.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Salvation, then have not all Men a ſufficiency of means vouchſafed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto them, whereby to be ſaved: But all Men have a ſufficiency of means in this kinde vouchſafed unto them. Ergo.</hi> The Conſequence in the former Propoſition, is pregnant, without Proof. For it is greater then contradiction, that they, who have no Propitiatory Sacrifice offered up for them, nor Attonement made for their Sins, have no ſufficiency of means for Salvation. So that if God intended no ſuch Oblation, no ſuch Attonement for any man, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, moſt certain it is that ſuch men are in no capacity of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and conſequently can have no ſufficiency of means whereby to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>The truth of the Minor Propoſition, which avoucheth a ſufficiency of means vouchſafed by God unto all Men whereby to be ſaved, might be evidenced by ſundry Demonſtrations. But becauſe the compleat and full Demonſtration of this Propoſition, is one of the moſt conſiderable atchievements to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and managed in the ſecond Part of the Work in hand, I ſhall (for the preſent) onely propoſe ſome few Conſiderations for the proof of it, reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the through-arguing of them until that opportunity.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, If all Men have not a ſufficiency of Means vouchſafed unto them whereby to be ſaved, then God dealeth with men far more diſtrictly, and with greater ſeverity in the new Covenant, the Covenant of Grace, then He did in the firſt Covenant, which was a Covenant of Works. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof, is, becauſe in, or under, the Covenant of Works, Men were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted by God with ſufficient Means for the performance of that Covenant, and ſo for the obtaining of the great Reward promiſed, or covenanted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which was no leſs then eternal Life, though (poſſibly) not a life ſo rich in Bleſſedneſs, as that Covenanted with men in the Covenant of Grace. That all Men without exception, had a ſufficiency of Means in <hi>Adam,</hi> to have perſiſted in Innocency, and to perform all the Articles and Terms required of them in that Covenant, which was made with them in Him, is the ſence of all men learned in the Scriptures, as well Modern, as Ancient, that yet I have heard of: nor will it (I ſuppoſe) be denyed by our Adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If it ſhould, there is proof upon proof at hand to make it good: but what needs a levy of men to gain that by force, which is voluntarily offered? Now then, it being far greater rigor, and ſeverity, to impoſe ſuch terms or conditions upon a man, in order to the ſaving of his life, or for the obtaining of any deſirable good, which are of an impoſſible performance unto him, then to impoſe onely ſuch, which he hath competent abilities to perform; evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that God muſt needs be more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igorous and hard unto men in the Covenant of Grace, made with them, in, and by <hi>Christ,</hi> then He was in the Covenant of Works made with them in <hi>Adam,</hi> in caſe it be ſuppoſed,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:94900:268"/> that He required unpoſſible Conditions of them in the former, and onely ſuch which were poſſible, in the latter.</p>
            <p>But that God dealeth more graciouſly and bountifully with Men in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant, made with them in <hi>Christ,</hi> then He did in the firſt, which was made with them in <hi>Adam,</hi> is the pregnant reſult of all things (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) that God hath ſpoken unto the World by His Son in the Goſpel. Nor can our Adverſaries themſelves deny it without the loud reclamation of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Truth. To pretend, that God dealeth more graciouſly and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with His Elect, in the Covenant of Grace, then He did in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, but not with the generality of Men, is but a ſlim evaſion, and ſuppoſeth, either that the Covenant of Grace is not made with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Men (which is a notorious untruth, and hath been detected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly once and again already) or that this Covenant is not made upon the ſame terms, and conditions, with all thoſe intereſſed, or included in it; which is a conceit of no whit better an accord, either with Reaſon, or Truth.</p>
            <p>Secondly: If all Men have not a ſufficiency of Means granted unto them<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> by God, then God dealeth with the generality, or far greateſt part of Men, more rigorouſly, and with leſs mercy, and this under the Covenant of Grace, then He doth with the Devils themſelves. The Reaſon is plain: becauſe, in caſe Men have not a ſufficiency of Means whereby to be ſaved, they have onely Means given them whereby to increaſe their Condemnation; yea ſuch means, and ſo and upon ſuch terms given them, that they cannot but uſe them to their greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more heavy Condemnation, then that whereunto they ſhould, or could have been liable, had no ſuch Covenant of Grace been made with them, or tendered unto them. For if they be not enabled by God to Repent, and to beleeve the Goſpel, they muſt needs be ſubjected to an abſolute neceſſity of deſpiſing, or neglecting it, there being no <hi>medium</hi> between <hi>accepting</hi> the great Salvation brought unto them therein, which is done by Faith, and the neglecting of it, which is always accompanied with Unbelief. Now a neglect of the Goſpel, and of the great Salvation tendred therein by God unto men, is the firſt-born of Provocations in the ſight of God, and maketh men ſevenfold more the Children of Wrath, and of Death, then otherwiſe they would have been. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>if we</hi> NEGLECT <hi>ſo great a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 2. 3</note>? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> implying, that this ſin, is unqueſtionably more exaſperating, incenſing, enraging the Almighty againſt His Creature, Man, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin, or ſins, whatſoever. Yea, if a man by means of the Goſpel, and the Grace offered unto him therein, be not brought to Repentance, and to a forſaking of ways and practices of ſin, the ſins themſelves, which he ſhall commit under the Goſpel, will turn to a far deeper and more dreadful account in condemnation unto him, then the like ſins without the Goſpel would have done. So that it is clear on every ſide, that in caſe men be not enabled by God to Repent, and beleeve the Goſpel, the exhibition and tender of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel unto them muſt needs be an heaping of coals of fire upon their heads by God, a project and deſign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o render them two-fold, or rather an hundred-fold more the Children of Hell, Miſery, and Torment, then otherwiſe they had been. Whereas moſt certain it is, that God hath deſigned nothing, acted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in one kinde or other, to increaſe the Puniſhment or Condemnation of the Devils, eſpecially in any way of an unavoydable Neceſſity, above the demerit of their firſt ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If God doth not vouchſafe ſufficient means unto all Men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by<note place="margin">§. 29.</note>
               <pb n="500" facs="tcp:94900:269"/> to repent, beleeve, and ſo to be ſaved, then will He condemn, and deſtroy (or at leaſt increaſe the Condemnation and Deſtruction, of) far the greateſt part of Men, for that which is no ſin, (I mean, Impenitency and Unbelief.) For, 1. I ſuppoſe that it is no ſin at all in the Creature, not to perform or do any ſuch act, which is proper onely for God Himſelf to do, or which requires the lighting down of His Omnipotent Arm to effect it. 2. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (that which hath been both lately, and formerly proved) that God doth and will condemn and deſtroy men for Impenitency and Unbelief. So then if to Repent, and to Beleeve, be ſuch acts or works in the Soul, which cannot be produced, raiſed, or performed by men, by means of that ſtrength, or thoſe abilities which are vouchſafed unto them, but abſolutely require the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Power of God to effect them, it is no ways more ſinful in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not to exert or perform them, then it is, not to be God: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if God ſhould puniſh men for the non-performance of them, He ſhould puniſh them for that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in ſuch a caſe, and upon ſuch a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would be no ſin. Yea if God ſhould puniſh men for not endevoring, or not doing that which is in their power to do, in order to Repenting and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, He ſhould puniſh them for not attempting to make themſelves equal in Power unto God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If God hath not vouchſafed a ſufficiency of Power to beleeve<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> unto thoſe, who notwithſtanding do not beleeve, then did our Saviour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground or cauſe in the leaſt, wonder at the Unbelief of many in the Goſpel: yea, and at the Faith of others. <hi>And He could there do no mighty work, ſave that He layd His Hands upon a few ſick folk, and healed them. And He</hi> MARVFLLED BECAVSE OF THEIR UNBELIEF <note n="a" place="margin">Mark 6. 6</note>. On the other hand; <hi>When Jeſus heard it (i. e.</hi> the Anſwer of the <hi>Centurion) He</hi> MARVELLED, <hi>and ſaid unto them that followed, Verily I ſay unto you, I have not found ſo</hi> GREAT FAITH, <hi>no not in Iſrael</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 8. 10</note>. Firſt, there is not the leaſt cauſe, or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, why any man ſhould marvel, that Creatures, or ſecond Cauſes, ſhould not act above their ſphere; yea though there be the greateſt conjunction of ſuch means, which are proper and helpful unto them in order to ſuch actings, which lie within their ſphere. As for example: though the year be never ſo ſeaſonable and fruitful, yet there is not the leaſt occaſion to marvel, or think it ſtrange, that the Thorn ſhould not bring forth grapes, or the Thiſtle, figs. So in caſe there be twenty great lights ſhining in a room, it is no matter of wonder at all that a blinde man ſeeth nothing at all that is before him. In like manner, in caſe it be ſuppoſed, that men are utterly deſtitute of a Power of Beleeving, there is not the leaſt ayr, or colour of an occaſion, why any man ſhould think it ſtrange that they ſhould not beleeve, what helps, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ſoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> towards, beleeving, they have otherwiſe. So again: when cauſes, or means, which are known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o act neceſſarily, uniformly, and conſtantly in their way, do move and act accordingly, there is not the leaſt occaſion given why any man ſhould marvel or wonder at it. When the Sun ſhineth, or fire burneth, when birds fly, or fiſhes ſwim, no man is tempted, or provoked to the leaſt degree of admiration. Nor is there any whit more reaſon, or cauſe, of marvel, that any Perſon at any time ſhould beleeve, though under the greateſt diſadvantages for beleeving, in caſe it be ſuppoſed and known, that that Cauſe, which worketh, or produceth Faith in Men (as <hi>viz.</hi> the Power of God, by which Faith is always produced in Men, when they do beleeve) ſhould always work, or act, neceſſitatingly, or irreſiſtibly, in the production of it. Poſſibly the Grace of God, by which men under
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:94900:269"/> ſignal diſadvantages are (according to our Adverſaries Principles) neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to beleeve, may be juſt matter of admiration unto men: but the vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafement of ſuch grace ſuppoſed, the act of beleeving in men, is no ground of admiration at all; no more, then it was under the Law, to ſee a man making haſte to his City of Refuge, being hotly and cloſely purſued by the Avenger of Blood; or then now it would be to fee a young Infant a mile from Home, being carryed along in the Parents arms. However (to add this by the way) I incline to think, that the reaſon of our Saviours <hi>marv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lling</hi> upon the <hi>Centurions</hi> Anſwer, was not ſimply and abſolutely the excellency or greatneſs of his Faith diſcovering it ſelf thereby, but in part, the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſtupidity and unmanlikeneſs of ſpirit in thoſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which He was occaſioned to reminde and conſider, by the notableneſs of that Faith, which ſhined in a man who was (and had been, in all likelyhood) a Pagan, and a Soldier, and an Officer of rank amongſt Soldiers; all which, in their reſpective Natures, and according to common experience (which ſtill follows the Natures of things, and diſcovers them) are diſadvantages to Beleeving. The words mentioned have a breathing of ſuch an import: <hi>When Jeſus heard it, He marvelled, and ſaid, I have not found ſo great Faith,</hi> NO, NOT IN ISRAEL. If Beleeving depends upon the Omnipotent Exertions of God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any ſuch manner, as our Adverſaries imagine, our Saviour could have no competent reaſon to marvel, either that it ſhould be found, where it was; or not found, where it was not; unleſs this ſhould be a ground of marvelling unto Him, that God by His Omnipotency ſhould be able to work Faith, in whom He pleaſeth; or that Man ſhould not act and do more, then He hath Power to do, yea or then all the Creatures in Heaven, or in Earth, can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Him to do, I mean, beleeve.</p>
            <p>Fifthly: If they who beleeve not, have no ſufficiency of Power vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> by God to beleeve, then is the Faith of thoſe, who do beleeve, no reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or juſt matter of reproof, or ſhame, unto thoſe, who beleeve not. But the Scripture often puts thoſe, who beleeve not, to rebuke and ſhame, by mentioning unto them the examples of thoſe, who do beleeve. <hi>Ergo.</hi> This latter Propoſition needs no other Proof, but onely the ſight and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe and ſuch like Paſſages. <hi>For John came unto you in the way of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ye beleeved Him not: but the Publicans and Harlots beleeved him. And ye, when ye had ſeen it, repented not afterwards, that ye might beleeve him</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 21. 32</note>. <hi>The men of Niniveh ſhall riſe up in Judgment with this generation, and ſhall condemn it, becauſe they repented at the preaching of Jonas: and behold a greater then Jonas is here</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 12. 14</note>. <hi>By Faith Noah being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his Houſe, by which He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the World</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 11. 7</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From ſuch places as theſe it is evident, that the Faith, Repentance, and Obedience of the Saints, or of ſuch perſons who do beleeve, repent, and obey, are juſt matter of Condemnation unto thoſe, who beleeve not, repent not, obey not, and repreſent them as inexcuſable. But now (to make good the ſequel in the Major Propoſition) theſe worthy actings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments of thoſe, in whom they are ſound, would be no ways conſiderable for any ſuch end or purpoſe, as the ſhaming or condemning of unbeleeving, impenitent and diſobedient Perſons, unleſs it be ſuppoſed that theſe have, or had, or at leaſt might have had, and this upon the ſame terms with thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the like power and abilities, whereby to Beleeve, Repent, and Obey, as they did, or do. The caſting great matters into the Treaſury by rich men, was no diſparagement, or matter of ſhame to the <hi>poor widow,</hi> that caſt in
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:94900:270"/> two mites onely, becauſe theſe <hi>two mites</hi> were her <hi>whole ſubſtance,</hi> ſhe was not able to caſt in more: in which reſpect our Saviour Himſelf gives her this teſtimony, that <hi>ſhe had caſt in more then they all.</hi> Their caſting in great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, would have been matter of juſt diſparagement unto her, in caſe ſhe had been as wealthy as they, and ſhould have caſt in her <hi>two mites</hi> onely. Nor is the flying of a fowl in the ayr, any diſparagement to a man, in that he doth not the like: nor is the ſpeaking of Greek and Hebrew by him, who hath been ſeven years at School to learn theſe Tongues, and hath had the help of men expert and skilful in them to direct him, any matter of diſparagement to an Infant of days, who is not as yet capable of ſuch education, though he ſpeaketh them not. And generally where there is not an equality of ſtrength, means, and abilities for the performance of an action that is commendable, the performance of it by him, or them, who have the advantage of ſtrength and means in this kinde, doth no ways reflect diſparagement upon the others, though they perform it not. If thoſe who do beleeve, have the Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Heaven to aſſiſt them in beleeving, nay to neceſſitate them to beleeve, certainly their beleeving is no matter of diſrepute or diſgrace unto thoſe who beleeve not, eſpecially if it be ſuppoſed that they have no Power at all to beleeve.</p>
            <p>Sixthly; If Gods Purpoſe and Intent be to ſtop the mouths of all ſuch<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> Perſons, and to leave them without excuſe, who ſhall prove, wicked, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unbeleeving, &amp;c. then doth He vouchſafe ſufficiency of Power, and of Means to Repent, and Beleeve, and ſo to be ſaved. But the Conſequent is true, and moſt unqueſtionably evident from the Scriptures. Therefore the Antecedent is true alſo; <hi>viz.</hi> that God doth vouchſafe a ſufficiency of Power, or Means, unto all Men, whereby to beleeve, &amp;c. That Gods Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is, and that He maketh Proviſion accordingly, to ſtop the mouths of all wicked and ungodly men, ſo that they ſhall have nothing with any colour of Reaſon or Equity to plead for themſelves, why the Sentence of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death ſhould not paſs upon them, when they come to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Tribunal, is (for truth) as clear as the Light at Noon-day, from theſe and ſuch like places. <hi>For the inviſible things of Him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>to the intent they ſhould be without excuſe</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1. 20</note>: (as our former Tranſlators rendered,) [meaning, in caſe they ſhould neglect the <hi>glorifying of God</hi> by depending upon Him, ſerving, and obeying Him.] Our laſt Tranſlation maketh no difference, as to our purpoſe, rendering the words thus: <hi>ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> For if they [the Heathen] be <hi>without excuſe</hi> [by the means vouchſafed unto them by God, whereby to <hi>glorifie</hi> Him,] certainly it was His Intent to render or make them ſo, by the ſaid means. So again: <hi>Now we know that whatſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law,</hi> THAT EVERY MOVTH MAY BE STOPPED, <hi>and all the World [viz.</hi> of ungodly Perſons] <hi>may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty before God</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 3. 19</note>; or, ſubject to the Judgment of God, (as our former Tranſlation rendered the Original <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,) <hi>i. e.</hi> found guilty upon ſuch terms, that the Judgment of God in their Condemnation may appear eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ways equitable, and juſtifiable. I omit other places. Light enough ſhineth from theſe cited, to diſcover this for a certain Truth, that God intends the inexcuſableneſs of all Impenitent and Unbeleeving Perſons.</p>
            <p>Upon this foundation of Truth, I build this inference (in the Major Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) that therefore it muſt needs be, that He vouchſafeth a ſufficiency
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:94900:270"/> of Power, or Means, unto all Men, to Repent, and Beleeve. The Reaſon of this Conſequence is plain; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Plea of inſufficiency, or want of ſtrength, for the doing of what is commanded, is the firſt-born of apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies or excuſes, in the caſe of non-performance: yea it is an excuſe paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, not onely with all ingenuous and well-compoſed men, but even with thoſe that are of rough, ſtern, and ſevere Principles, if they be not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewitched or beſotted with the ſenceleſſneſs of expreſs Tyranny. The Perſon, whom the King found amongſt his gueſts without a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being demanded by Him, how he came in thither not having this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>was</hi> (ſaith the Parable) <hi>ſpeechleſs</hi>

            <p>To pretend, that Men are ſufficiently inexcuſable before God, for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not-doing many other things, which they have Power to do, though it be not ſuppoſed that they have ſufficient Power to beleeve, is to ſerve the glory of God with an <hi>inexcuſableneſs</hi> of their own deviſing, and which falls ſhort many degrees in reaching the Counſel and Purpoſe of God for the advancement of His glory in that behalf. For His Purpoſe is not to bring an inexcuſableneſs upon the heads of wicked and impenitent men, onely in reſpect of ſome leſſer, or lighter, whether omiſſions, or commiſſions, but in reſpect of that great and capital ſin alſo, Unbelief, yea mainly and chiefly in reſpect of this. Now men cannot appear before God <hi>inexcuſable</hi> upon the account of their Infidelity, or Unbelief, unleſs it be ſuppoſed that they had been ſufficiently furniſhed by Him with means, abilities, and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, for beleeving.</p>

All Men (they ſay) received ſufficient Power in <hi>Adam</hi> to beleeve: and upon this account God may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold them inexcuſable, if they do not beleeve. This Plea is like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity fetch'd from a far Country, which turns to no account when it is brought Home. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There hath nothing yet been brought upon any Stage, where I have been Spectator, that acted the part of a rational or probable Proof, that all Men were in <hi>Adam</hi> inveſted with a Power of beleeving. There is this Reaſon pregnant and ſtrong againſt it. If <hi>Adam</hi> yet innocent (for in this conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation onely we now ſpeak of him) had a Power of beleeving, then might he actually have beleeved, if he had pleaſed. But it was not poſſible that <hi>Adam,</hi> during his innocency, ſhould actually beleeve: becauſe all this while there was no word of Revelation from God concerning <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> without which there is no poſſibility of actual beleeving. To pretend, that <hi>Adam</hi> (and ſo all Men in <hi>Adam</hi>) had a Power, or Principle veſted in Him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:94900:271"/> He was able to beleeve whatſoever God ſhould at any time reveal unto Him, and conſequently to beleeve the Goſpel, in caſe it had been diſcovered unto Him, as now it is unto Men, is to ſpeak with no good accord to their own Principles, and with leſs accommodation to their Cauſe. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If there was a ſufficiency of Power given unto <hi>Adam</hi> whereby to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, then it is a plain caſe that beleeving requireth not the interpoſal of the Omnipotency of God in any extraordinary way, to procure, raiſe, or effect it. For (doubtleſs) this Omnipotency was not given unto <hi>Adam.</hi> And that which in one caſe, or at one time, cannot be effected without a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Omnipotency, neither can it be effected without the ſame at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither is a Power to beleeve whatſoever God ſhall reveal, a Power of beleeving ſavingly, or to Juſtification, according to the Principles of our Adverſaries, who generally term ſuch a Beleeving, (I mean, a Beleeving of what God hath revealed in the Goſpel) an Hiſtorical Faith, and make it ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically diſtinct from that Faith which juſtifieth, defining this to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency, reſting, or relying upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Juſtification. Therefore however, Men did not receive any Power in <hi>Adam</hi> to beleeve upon ſuch terms, or with ſuch a kinde of Faith, which now God requireth of them to their Juſtification. And to ſay, or prove, that <hi>Adam,</hi> or all Men in <hi>Adam,</hi> received Power to beleeve with any other kinde of Faith, then that, which now, in the lapſed eſtate of man, juſtifieth, is but to ſay or prove <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that which is broadly eccentrical, and irrelative to the buſineſs in hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſe that to beleeve the Goſpel, were juſtifying Faith (which my Faith beleeveth it to be) and that <hi>Adam</hi> had Power to have beleeved it (and ſo all Men in him) in caſe it had been revealed unto him, (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſo revealed, that He had certainly known, that the Revelation came from God: and that He ſhould have Power to beleeve it upon any other account of Revelation, then this, is an improbability of the firſt magnitude,) doubtleſs all Men now are inveſted with a Power of beleeving it upon ſuch terms, <hi>viz.</hi> in caſe it ſhall be revealed unto them ſo, that they ſhall certainly know that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation cometh from God. For though the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers under the Goſpel, as men that <hi>make God a lyar,</hi> in that <hi>they beleeve not the Record, that He hath given of His Son</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 John 5. 10</note>, yet his meaning is not to charge them with offering this indignity unto God, knowingly, wittingly, and (as it were) to His face, or as if they knew well enough this <hi>Record</hi> to have been given by Him, and yet would not truſt, or beleeve Him therein: but by their Unbelief at this great Point, they are ſaid to <hi>make Him a lyar,</hi> in this ſence, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they reject that as a fable, or untruth, which yet hath been ſpoken, and aſſerted by God Himſelf for Truth, yea and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch terms, that by a diligent and ſtrict enquiry they might come to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledg that it was ſpoken and aſſerted by Him. For otherwiſe the light of Nature, and force of Conſcience, are ſcarcely in any man (much leſs in the generality of Unbeleevers) ſo far waſted, or ſpent, with ſinning, as that they can, immediately and directly, or any otherwiſe then conſtructively, or in a conſequential, indirect, and remote way, call God, <hi>a lyar.</hi> Therefore (doubtleſs) if Men received no other Power in <hi>Adam</hi> to beleeve, then onely in caſe of ſuch a Revelation of the Goſpel made unto him, or them in him, by God, which he, or they, muſt needs know came from God, they received no other power of Beleeving, in him, whileſt he ſtood, then what they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receive by, or from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſince <hi>Adams</hi> Fall. So that to fetch the
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:94900:271"/> inexcuſableneſs of Men in the ſin of their Unbelief, from <hi>Adam,</hi> is to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to the <hi>Indies</hi> with extream hazard and expence, to bring the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity from thence, which a man hath, and this every ways as well conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and in ſufficient quantity for his purpoſe, at his own Home.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If all Men received power in <hi>Adam</hi> to beleeve ſavingly, or to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, then muſt <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf needs be ſuppoſed to have received this power. If ſo, then muſt it be ſuppoſed withall to have been ſome ways uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; beneficial, and ſerviceable for ſome end and purpoſe of concernment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. For to conceive that it was a meer impertinency, or ſuperfluity, is an unſavory Notion. If the power we ſpeak of were any ways uſeful unto <hi>Adam,</hi> then was it uſeful, either for the enabling him to beleeve unto Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, whileſt he remained yet innocent: or, in caſe he ſhould fall, to carry along with him into his lapſed condition, that in this he might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by it to beleeve accordingly. But that it was not uſeful to Him in the former conſideration, is evident; becauſe during His eſtate of Innocency, He remained under a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Works; in which caſe, He neither had any neceſſity of Beleeving, in order to His Juſtification, having not yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or if any Neceſſity in this kinde had been upon Him, His Beleeving could not have juſtified Him, in as much as the Law of Juſtification by Faith, was not yet given or publiſhed by God. Nor was it, or could it be uſeful unto Him in the latter conſideration: for (doubtleſs) He carried no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaving, or juſtifying with Him out of His eſtate of Innocency, into His lapſed condition, which was a condition of Sin, Miſery, and Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially until the Promiſe of a Saviour was given, and that Trumpet of the great Jubilee had ſounded; that <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe,</hi> or break, <hi>the Serpents Head</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15</note>.</p>
            <p n="5">5. (And laſtly, for this) It is no ways probable that Men received power in <hi>Adam</hi> to beleeve, or at leaſt that any ſuch power, though received in him, is of any account with God to render Men inexcuſable under the ſin of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, in the days of the Goſpel (which is of equal conducement unto our purpoſe) becauſe the Holy Ghoſt aſſigns other grounds and reaſons (as we lately heard) to aſſert this inexcuſableneſs, but no where gives the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, either of any ſuch power to beleeve (as we now oppoſe) received by Men in <hi>Adam;</hi> much leſs, of any relation, which this Power ſhould have to that inexcuſableneſs of unbeleevers under the Goſpel, which God hath projected, or provided for, upon other terms. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe it ſhould be granted, that Men generally did receive in <hi>Adam</hi> ſuch a power of Beleeving, which is ſo much contended for, yet <hi>God</hi> having made a ſecond, a new <hi>Covenant,</hi> a <hi>Covenant</hi> of much more <hi>Grace,</hi> Love, and Mercy with them (whereof ſubſtantial and large proof hath been made, in the Premiſſes) it is no ways conſonant either to the Wiſdom of <hi>God,</hi> or to the unſearchable riches of His <hi>Grace</hi> in this <hi>new Covenant,</hi> that He ſhould proceed in Judgment againſt them upon any advantage taken from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition under the firſt <hi>Covenant.</hi> If men will here be peremptory, and ſay, that ſuch proceedings in Judgment againſt men are conſonant enough both to His Wiſdom, and to His <hi>Grace</hi> (in the <hi>new Covenant</hi>) let them either, 1. produce ſome Scripture to evince ſuch a conſonancy: or elſe, 2. let them confeſs, and profeſs, that they are in a ſufficient capacity, by means of that light of Reaſon, Judgment, and underſtanding that ſhineth in them, to judg and conclude what is agreeable to the Wiſdom, or <hi>Grace,</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant and direction from the Scriptures. To decline both theſe, is (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:94900:272"/> interpreted) to profeſs Will and Obſtinacy under the Name of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The former (I am certain) they cannot do: if they do the latter, they ſin againſt the firſt-born of thoſe Principles, which they chiefly imploy in the defence and maintenance of their Cauſe. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly, for this alſo) The Scriptures themſelves, as they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſilent of any purpoſe or intent in <hi>God,</hi> to judg or condemn men upon any thing, for which they may ſeem accountable from the firſt <hi>Covenant</hi> made with them in <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo do they frequently mention, and aſſert, the Counſel and Purpoſe of <hi>God</hi> to proceed in the Judgment and Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men, by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and upon ſuch Articles relating to the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> of the neglect or breach whereof Men ſhall be found guilty. <hi>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the</hi> WORD THAT I HAVE SPOKEN, THE SAME SHALL JVDG <hi>Him in the laſt day</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">John 12: 48</note>. He doth not ſay, <hi>the Word that I have ſpoken ſhall judg Him, &amp;c.</hi> but, THE SAME <hi>ſhall judg Him, &amp;c.</hi> which (doubtleſs) hath this emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal import, that the Word, which He hath ſpoken [ſince His coming in the fleſh, or, in the <hi>Goſpel</hi>] and no other word whatſoever but this, ſhall <hi>judg Him, [i. e.</hi> be inſiſted upon to evict Him guilty, or worthy of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.] As for all that the Apoſtles ſpake in their preaching the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and what other Miniſters thereof ſpeak in theirs, ſo far as they preach the Truth of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or that, which being neglected will render men liable unto Judgment, is conſtructively, and in effect, but the ſame Word with that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> taught and ſpake in the fleſh. In like manner the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of himſelf, and his fellow-Apoſtles, and all Miniſters of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> expreſſeth himſelf thus: <hi>For we are unto God a ſweet</hi> [or, the ſweet] <hi>ſavor of Chriſt, in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 15</note>. How was the Apoſtle, or how are the faithful Miniſters of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>ſweet ſavor of Chriſt unto God, in thoſe who periſh? viz.</hi> as the effectual tender of <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto Men, in the Name of <hi>God,</hi> for their Salvation, rendereth them utterly inexcuſable, and every ways, and moſt juſtly, liable to the Judgment of <hi>God,</hi> if they accept Him not by beleeving on Him. So elſewhere He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts diſobedience to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as the great Article of Indictment againſt thoſe, that ſhall be <hi>deſtroyed</hi> by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, when He ſhall be revealed from Heaven with His mighty Angels, in flaming fire</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">2 Theſ. 1. 7, 8</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And moſt frequently the ſentence of Condemnation is bent againſt the ſin of non beleeving, and neglect of the <hi>Goſpel: Mark 16. 16. Heb. 2. 2, 3. Joh.</hi> 8. 24, &amp;c. So that there is no colour, but that which is very waſhy, for any power of Beleeving received in <hi>Adam</hi> by the generality of Men: and yet leſs colour is there for ſuch a conceit as this, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould bring the vengeance of eternal fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, for not beleeving with that Power, which they received in <hi>Adam:</hi> for other power to beleeve, beſides this, our Adverſaries allow them none. Queſtionleſs the Holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> who is ſo ſollicitous from place to place to vindicate the Righteouſneſs and Equity of <hi>Gods</hi> Proceedings in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of wicked and unbeleeving men, would have inſiſted more or leſs upon that ground, which our Adverſaries make the <hi>prora</hi> and <hi>puppis,</hi> the firſt and laſt of His vindication in this kind (I mean, their inveſtitute in <hi>Adam</hi> with power to beleeve) had there 1. been any ſuch inveſtiture; and, 2. had the conſideration thereof been of any value for ſuch a purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Seventhly: If all Men have power to beleeve, 1. That <hi>God</hi> is: 2. That<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> He is a Rewarder of thoſe that feek Him, then have they power to beleeve juſtifyingly, or to acceptation with <hi>God.</hi> But all Men have this power. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               <pb n="507" facs="tcp:94900:272"/> The Conſequence in the Major Propoſition the Apoſtle makes unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, where He ſaith: <hi>He that cometh unto God, muſt beleeve that He is: and that He is a Rewarder of thoſe that ſeek Him</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Hebr. 11. 6</note>. By <hi>coming unto God,</hi> it is clear by the whole carriage of the Context round about, that he meaneth a coming unto Him with acceptation, and ſo as <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The Minor Propoſition, is the ſence of learned men generally, eſpecially of ſuch, who have acquainted themſelves with the Writings of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and other ſtudious and learned men amongſt the Heathen.

This <hi>glorifying of God, as God,</hi> imports (amongſt other things) a beleeving, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, depending on Him, as <hi>a Rewarder of thoſe who ſeek Him.</hi> For they who do not thus beleeve, or depend upon Him, cannot be ſaid, whatſoever they ſhall meaſure unto Him beſides, to <hi>glorifie Him as God.</hi> 2. As certain it is, that had they not had a ſufficiency of power thus to have <hi>glorified Him</hi> (I mean, <hi>as God,</hi> and as <hi>a Rewarder of thoſe who ſeek Him</hi>) the neglect, or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of it, would have been no provocation in the ſight of <hi>God</hi> ſo ſignally exaſperating, or provoking, as to have kindled a fire of ſuch high indignation in His Breſt againſt them, which ſhould burn ſo neer to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Hell, as that ſpecified. <hi>The ſervant</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that knew not his Lords Will, and did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Luke 12. 48</note>. Yea (doubtleſs) had not this <hi>ſervant</hi> been in a capacity of knowing <hi>his Lords will,</hi> in caſe he had been duly inquiſitive after it, he had not been <hi>beaten with any ſtripes</hi> at all, though he had committed ſuch things, which had been <hi>worthy ſtripes</hi> in other men. This is evident from that great Principle of Equity, atteſted by our Saviour in the words immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: <hi>For unto whom ſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much required, [of him, i. e.</hi> of him onely,] and conſequently, not of others, to whom little hath been given. And if we ſhall go along with the ſaid Principle, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will directly lead us, we ſhall be brought by it to this Concluſion, <hi>that unto whom ſoever nothing is given, of him nothing will be required:</hi> as in the Parable of the Talents, we hear of no ſervant called to account, but onely ſuch, who had received <hi>Talents,</hi> one, or more. Therefore without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie the Heathen generally had, and have, power, means, and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities ſufficient to come to the knowledg of this gracious Property in <hi>God,</hi>
               <pb n="508" facs="tcp:94900:273"/> that <hi>He is a Rewarder of thoſe who ſeek Him;</hi> and conſequently of <hi>coming to Him</hi> with acceptation. And let me add this by the way: That He that hath a ſufficiency of power and means, to come to the Knowledg or Belief, 1. That <hi>God is:</hi> 2. That <hi>He is a Rewarder of thoſe, who ſeek Him,</hi> is not by this ſufficiency ſimply neceſſitated, either to beleeve the one, or the other. It is with the generality of men in this reſpect, as it is with <hi>God</hi> himſelf: as well the one, as the other, have power to do many things, which yet they do not; and therefore are not by a power of acting, neceſſitated unto action. Yea it is a Principle owned by our Adverſaries themſelves, that men general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have power to do, more then they do: and it is an unqueſtionable rule in the art of Reaſon, that <hi>à negatione actûs, ad negationem potentiae, non valet argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.</hi> So that in caſe it ſhould, or could, be proved (which I beleeve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>vicious, perverſe, corrupted, voyd and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all good, rich and abounding in evil. Nevertheleſs, the Lord of his Mercy (who doth not onely love, but is Himſelf Love and Charity) being yet willing by his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to love that which is not worthy of love, hath not altogether diſsipated, loſt, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed men, as their ſin did require; but hath ſuſtained and ſupported them in ſweetneſs and patience,</hi> giving them time and leaſure to return unto Him, <hi>and ſet themſelves to that Obedience from which they had ſtrayed. And though He did diſſemble and was ſilent (as if He would hide himſelf from them) ſuffering them to go after the deſires and wiſhes of their luſt, without Laws, without Government, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any correction by his Word: yet he hath given them warnings enough, which might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited them to ſeek, taſte, and finde him, for to know and honor him as it behoved them. For he hath lifted up every where, and in all
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:94900:273"/> places, and things, his Enſigns and Arms, yea ſo clearly and intelligibly imblazoned, that there was</hi> no one could pretend ignorance of the Knowledg of ſo ſoveraign a Lord, <hi>who had in ſo ample a manner exalted his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:</hi> viz. <hi>That in all parts of the World, in Heaven and in Earth, he hath written, and even engraven the Glory of his Might, Goodneſs, Wiſdom, and Eternity. Saint</hi> Paul <hi>therefore ſaith very true, That the Lord never left himſelf without witneſs; even towards them, unto whom he hath not ſent any knowledg of his Word. For as much as all the Creatures, from the Firmament to the center of the Earth, might be witneſſes, and meſſengers of his glory unto all Men, to draw them to ſeek him, and after having found him, to welcom him; and</hi> do him homage, according to the dignity of a Lord ſo good, ſo powerful, ſo wiſe, and eternal: <hi>And alſo did help each one in its place to this queſt. For the Birds ſinging, ſung God; Beaſts cryed aloud unto him, the Elements ſtood in fear of him, Mountains rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with him, Rivers and Fountains cast their eyes upon him, Herbs and Flowers ſmiled on him. Although that indeed there was no neceſsity to ſeek him very far: by reaſon that each one might finde him in his own ſelf, being that we are all kept up and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his vertue dwelling in us. In the mean while, for to manifeſt more amply his goodneſs and infinite clemency among Men, he hath not contented himſelf to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them all by ſuch documents, as we have expreſt: but hath ſpecially given to underſtand his voyce to a certain People, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Eightly (and laſtly) If wicked men, and ſuch who periſh in their ſins<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> through Impenitency and Unbelief, have not a ſufficient Power and Means to Repent and Beleeve, then when God, moſt graciouſly, moſt affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, moſt earneſtly invites them to Repent, and to Beleeve, and this in order to their Peace and Salvation, He rather inſults over them in their extremity of weakneſs and miſery, then really intends any thing gracious, or of a ſaving import to them. But to conceive thus of God is moſt unworthy of Him, and diſhonorable to Him, and not far from Blaſphemy. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:94900:274"/> Reaſon of the Connexion in the Major Propoſition, is, becauſe to profeſs love to a man that is in imminent danger of his life, and upon this account to perſwade, preſs, and be earneſt with him, to do that for the ſafety of his life, which the Perſwader in this caſe abſolutely knoweth to be unpoſſible for the perſwaded to do, (as ſuppoſe it were, to make him wings, and fly in the ayr beyond the Seas, or to turn himſelf into a fiſh, and live in the Seas, or the like) ſuch an addreſſment as this to ſuch a poor wretch, would be baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuſory, and inſulting, nor could it admit of any better interpretation. In like manner, if God, knowing that a natural and ungodly man is in the utmoſt danger of periſhing for ever, and withall, that he hath no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or beleeve, ſhall yet vehemently and affectionately urge, preſs, and perſwade ſuch a man to Repent and Beleeve, that he may not periſh, can ſuch an application as this bear any other conſtruction, then as deriſory, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from one, who doth not ſimply delight in the death of a Sinner, but to make the death of ſuch a miſerable Creature, as full of gall, and bitterneſs, and miſery, as He well knows how to do? Therefore certainly, when God <hi>ſtretcheth out his hand all the day long</hi> to wicked men; when he ſaith, <hi>turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways: why will ye dye, &amp;c.</hi> when He ſaith, <hi>Repent, and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſsions, ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>turn at my reproof,</hi> (with the like,) He knoweth that what He thus ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and affectionately requireth of them, and preſſeth them unto, they have power to perform: otherwiſe in ſuch expreſſions as theſe, He ſhould be like unto a Judg, or King, that having ſentenced a lame man to death for Treaſon, or ſome other crime, ſhould promiſe him his life, in caſe he would run twenty miles within an hours ſpace, and accordingly preſs him with much ſeriouſneſs unto it. I have met with nothing (to my beſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) from the Pen of any Defender of the contrary Faith, to obſtruct or check this Argument in the courſe of it: nor am I able to imagine what can with any face of Reaſon, or of Truth, conteſt with it.</p>
            <p>To ſay, that when God with the greateſt earneſtneſs of expreſſion, calls upon wicked men to Repent, He onely ſignifies unto them, what would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their deſtruction, were it found in them, but ſuppoſeth not any Principle or power in them to exhibit or perform it; ſuch an allegation (I ſay) as this hath neither ſalt nor ſavor in it. For to what account can it be brought, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould inform wicked men, how, or which way they may eſcape deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it be ſuppoſed withall that they are in no capacity, no not ſo much as under a poſſibility, of receiving any benefit by ſuch an information? Beſides, God cannot truly and cordially profeſs that He <hi>deſireth not the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> or, <hi>of him that dyeth,</hi> upon the account onely of an information directed to ſuch a man, concerning the way, or means of his eſcape, unleſs it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed withall that he is made capable by Him of benefit by ſuch an informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in a condition to make uſe of it in order to an eſcape. And (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude) meer informations are not wont to be given in exhortatory or precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive language, as, <hi>turn ye, turn ye, &amp;c.</hi> nor in ſuch pathetique ſtrains, as, <hi>Why will ye dye, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> nor with ſuch Promiſes annexed, as, <hi>ſo ſhal not iniquity be your ruine:</hi> nor (laſtly) where they are of no uſe, neither to thoſe to whom they are given, nor to Him that giveth them, nor to any others: which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſideration of particulars would plainly appear to be the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
            <p>To ſay that in ſuch affectionate Exhortations and Expreſſions as thoſe<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> under preſent conſideration, God onely expreſſeth His Will of Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:94900:274"/> ſignifying that Righteouſneſs, and Repentance after ſin, and ſo the Peace and Salvation of His Creature, upon, and by means of theſe, are things ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply agreeable to His Nature, Minde, and Goodneſs: but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oth not intend to ſignifie any Will or Purpoſe in Himſelf to work Repentance in the perſons to whom He thus ſpeaketh, nor yet that they have power to repent without Him; is an allegation as inconſiderable, and inconſiſtent with Reaſon, as the former. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Righteouſneſs, and Repentance after ſin, and the Salvation of the Creature hereupon, be ſimply agreeable to His Nature, Minde, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then why ſhould not the Repentance (and upon this, the Salvation) of thoſe perſons, to whom He particularly addreſſeth Himſelf in thoſe gracious and earneſt Compellations and Exhortations of which we now ſpeak, be every whit as agreeable to His Nature, Minde, and Goodneſs, as the Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or Salvation, of any other perſons in their caſe? He no where ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any difference in this kinde. Or if the Repentance and Salvation of ſome Sinners be agreeable to His Nature, Minde, and Goodneſs, and not of others, it is a plain caſe, that the Repentance and Salvation of the Creature, ſimply conſidered, are not the things that are ſo agreeable to Him, but the Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Salvation of ſuch and ſuch particular ſubjects. For Repentance and Salvation are the ſame things, and of the ſame Nature, in what perſons, or ſubjects ſoever: no perſonal conſideration whatſoever altereth their Natures, or eſſential Properties. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the intent of God were to expreſs or ſignifie, His Approbative Will of the Repentance and Salvation of his Creature, or the agreeableneſs of theſe to His Nature, Minde, and Goodneſs, He would rather have expreſſed it in applications of himſelf unto ſuch perſons, or ſubjects, whoſe Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Salvation he really intendeth and deſireth, then in addreſſments made to thoſe, whoſe Repentance and Salvation he deſireth not; nay, whom he was reſolved from Eternity (for this is the voyce of the Oracle conſulted by our Adverſaries) to deſtroy for ever. It were very unproper and hard for a Judg, or Prince, to make a feeling and affectionate Diſcourſe of their cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, goodneſs and ſweetneſs of Nature, their great averſeneſs to acts of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, &amp;c. unto ſuch perſons, whom they had been of a long time reſolved, and before any cauſe adminiſtred by theſe perſons of ſuch a reſolution againſt them, to put to a terrible, torturing, and ignominlous death, eſpecially at; or neer the time, when this moſt ſevere execution is intended to be done upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) The Argument propounded by us, and with whoſe vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication we are yet in labor, doth neither ſuppoſe, that God will work Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (as our Adverſaries call, <hi>working Repentance</hi>) in the perſons there ſpoken of, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he will work it upon any ſuch terms, that it ſhall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, or infallibly be effected, nor yet that the perſons themſelves can repent without God. That which it ſuppoſeth, is this, that God is ſo far moving and aſſiſting the Hearts, Wills, and Conſciences of theſe men, in order to their Repentance, that if they were but willing to do, what he enableth them to do, in reference and order to the ſame, their Repentance would be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they ſaved upon it. In which caſe (I mean, if they ſhould repent) this Repentance were moſt juſtly aſcribable unto God, not to themſelves, in as much as it is he, that 1. Giveth them power and abilities to repent. 2. That ſecretly forms and faſhions their Wills, ſo as to make them willing actually to repent: 3. That ſupports their Wills thus framed, to, and in, the
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:94900:275"/> production of the act it ſelf of Repentance. Whereas that which men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do, in, towards, or about their Repentance, is ſo inconſiderable, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what God doth, that the greatneſs of his Grace and interpoſure herein, deſerves (in a manner) all the praiſe and honor that belongs unto the action: although it be true alſo, that the perſon himſelf, who repenteth, or in whom Repentance is wrought, muſt of neceſſity be ſo far<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to ſuch a degree intereſſed, and active in the work, that the work it ſelf may be as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly aſcribed unto him, or called, <hi>His,</hi> as it is aſcribed unto God, and termed, his. For it is man that <hi>repenteth,</hi> not God, though what he doth in repenting, he doth by the operating and aſſiſting Grace of God: in which reſpect it is ſaid to be his <hi>gift.</hi> But concerning the conjuncture and reſpective intereſts of the firſt and ſecond Cauſes in the production or raiſing of one and the ſame act, we ſhall (God willing) diſcourſe more particularly in the ſecond part of this Work, where alſo we ſhall clear and diſcharge all thoſe Paſſages and Texts of Scripture from their hard ſervice, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by ſome to ſerve againſt this great Truth (of that high importance for the glory, as well of the Grace, as Juſtice, of God) That all Men without exception have a ſufficiency of power vouchſafed unto them by God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to Repent, and to beleeve, unto Salvation: and that it is through want of Will, (or rather, willingneſs) not of Power, that any man periſheth. At preſent, to the further confirmation of the main Doctrine commended in this Diſcourſe, we argue thus,</p>
            <p>In the eleventh place: <hi>If God intended not the Death of Chriſt, as a Ranſom</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 37. <hi>Argum. 11.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>or Satisfaction for all Men, then are there ſome Men, whom He never intended to ſave, but to leave irrecoverably to everlaſting deſtruction and perdition.</hi> This Propoſition (I ſuppoſe) ſtands firm and ſtrong upon its own <hi>baſis:</hi> and needs no Prop of Proof or Argument to ſupport it. For God intending to ſave no man but by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> evident it is, that if there be any man, or number of men, for whoſe Salvation he did not intend this Death, that he never intended their Salvation. Therefore I aſſume: <hi>But there are no ſuch Men, or number of Men, whoſe Salvation God never intended,</hi> or <hi>whom He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to leave irrecoverably to everlaſting perdition. Ergo.</hi> The Reaſon of this Propoſition is, partly becauſe whatſoever God at any time intends, he intended always, yea from Eternity; partly alſo becauſe there was a time, when all Men were righteous and holy, <hi>viz.</hi> during the whole time of <hi>Adams</hi> integrity, in whoſe loyns all Men then were, and ſo muſt needs be Partakers of the ſame Holineſs and Integrity with him. So that unleſs we ſhall ſay and hold, that God never intended the Salvation of juſt and holy men, but to leave them irrecoverably to everlaſting perdition, we cannot ſay that there are, or were any men, or any number of men, whoſe Salvation he never intended, or whom he intended to leave irrecoverably to everlaſting deſtruction. Yea all Men had a Being in God himſelf, before they received or had a Being in <hi>Adam:</hi> in which reſpect <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf is called, <hi>the Son of God</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 4. 38</note>, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he received his Being from him, as (though not after the manner that) children receive their Beings from their Parents, or Fathers. Now whereſoever, or in what eſtate and condition ſoever, <hi>Adam</hi> was, there were all Men in the ſame eſtate and condition with him. So then all Men conſidered as being in God, were nothing but God himſelf, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common, and moſt true Maxim of Divines; <hi>Quicquid in Deo eſt, eſt Deus:</hi> whatſoever is in God, is God. The truth of this Maxim was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinced by us Cap. 4. of this Diſcourſe, where we argued the abſolute
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:94900:275"/> ſimplicity of the Divine Eſſence, or God. Therefore if God purpoſed from Eternity to leave any man, or number of men, irrecoverably to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction, this Purpoſe was conceived, or taken up by Him againſt theſe men, whileſt they were yet onely in His Will and Power, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, whileſt they were nothing but Himſelf. But that God ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily reſolve and decree, never to ſave, nor to intend to ſave, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and conſign over irrevocably, irreverſibly, irrecoverably to eternal miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deſtruction, millions of men, whileſt they were yet perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy, yea whileſt they were yet nothing but Himſelf, is (doubtleſs) a Notion hardly incident to the judgment or thoughts of any man, who trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to think irreverently, or unworthily of God.</p>
            <p>It is like it will be here pleaded, that God in His Purpoſe or Decree to<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> leave the men we ſpeak of, to everlaſting perdition, doth not look upon them, or conſider them, as being in himſelf, nor yet as being righteous and holy in <hi>Adam,</hi> but as men that would in time prove corrupt, ſinful, and abominable. And for God, to decree to leave men, thus conſidered, to irrecoverable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, is no ways unworthy of him. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If God in his Decree of Reprobation, conſidered men as ſinful and wicked, then He paſſed over, and took no knowledg or notice of them, whileſt they were yet righteous and innocent: or if he did take knowledg of their righteouſneſs, yet, this notwithſtanding, and (as it were) with the neglect and contempt of it, He paſſed that moſt dreadful Doom, or Decree of an eternal Reprobation againſt them. Whereas the Scriptures every where commend and highly magnifie, the conſtant love, care, and reſpects of God, towards the righteous. <hi>The righteous Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) loveth righteouſneſs: and His countenance doth behold the upright</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſa. 11. 7</note>. And again: <hi>For thou, Lord, wilt bleſs the righteous: with favor wilt thou compaſs him, as with a ſhield</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pſa. 5. 12</note>. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Pſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34, 15</note>. (To omit many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of like aſſertion.) From whence it evidently appears, 1. That God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds and ſees, and cannot but behold and ſee, thoſe that are righteous: 2. That ſeeing and beholding them ſuch, He always loves them, and delights in them. Therefore it is unpoſſible, that God at any time ſhould not ſee and behold the perſons we ſpeak of, being righteous, and whileſt righteous: And 2. that ſeeing and beholding them ſuch, that He ſhould not love them, and intend graciouſly to them: and conſequently, that all this while, He ſhould intend or decree the extremity of all evil and miſery againſt them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is altogether inconſiſtent with the Righteouſneſs and Equity of Gods Proceedings, to neglect or paſs by the preſent condition or ways of men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of righteouſneſs, or unrighteouſneſs, and to reſpect them, or meaſure out unto them, either Grace, or Diſpleaſure, either Reward, or Puniſhment, according to their future condition, or according to what He foreſees their ways will be afterward. All Gods Purpoſes and Decrees relate unto men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature and exigency of their preſent conditions, not of their future. If a man be at preſent in a condition of Righteouſneſs, he is under the gracious influence and benediction of that Decree of God, whereby He hath decreed Life and Peace and Bleſſedneſs to righteous men. And ſuppoſe it be known unto God, that this man, righteous at preſent, will afterwards forſake his righteouſneſs, and turn aſide into ways of unrighteouſneſs, yet whileſt he remaineth righteous, he is not under the dint or danger of that Decree of God, which reſpects unrighteous men, and whereby Wrath and
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:94900:276"/> Judgment are decreed againſt them. That Diſpoſition or Principle, which we now aſcribe unto God, is moſt clearly aſſerted in the Scriptures by Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that by way of vindication of his Righteouſneſs, from the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy conceits of thoſe, who judged otherwiſe of Him. <hi>If a man</hi> BE JVST, <hi>and</hi> DO <hi>that which is lawful and right, And hath not eaten upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, neither hath lift up his eyes to the Idols of the houſe of Iſrael, &amp;c.

               </note>. By theſe, and very many more places of like conſideration (in reference to the buſineſs in hand) which might be added, it is fully evident, that particular men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the perſons of men, from time to time, come under the eternal Decrees of God, either of Life, or Death, of Salvation, or Condemnation, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature, exigency or import of their potential or future, but of their actual and preſent conditions reſpectively: and conſequently, that if the generality of men were, either from Eternity righteous (and righteous they muſt needs be, whileſt they were in God, and in him onely, and were nothing but God) or at any time after their Creation, as they were in <hi>Adam,</hi> during the time of his innocency, they muſt needs, whileſt they were in theſe capac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) If God from Eternity looked upon the far greater part of men (all thoſe I mean, who are Reprobates, ſo called) as Perſons that would in time prove ſinful, or as Perſons in time proved ſinful, and under this proſpect of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> paſſed a Decree of Reprobation upon, or againſt them, then was this ſinfulneſs wherein He beheld them, the ground or cauſe of this Decree of Reprobation, or not. If not, to what purpoſe is it pleaded or ſtood upon, in reference to the ſaid Decree? And why is it not plainly and right-down affirmed, that God reprobated them out of his meer Will and Pleaſure, without the interveniency of any conſideration of ſin, to incline or move him thereunto? And if this be ſo, He need not in his Decree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, look upon them as ſinful, but ſimply as men. If He looked upon
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:94900:276"/> them ſimply as men, then he looked upon them as the pure and perfect work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of his own hands: if ſo, then the perfect workmanſhip of his own hands muſt be the object of his Reprobation, and conſequently, that which is good: <hi>For God ſaw every thing that He had made, and behold, it was very good</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 1. 31</note>. But unpoſſible it is that that which is <hi>good,</hi> eſpecially <hi>very good,</hi> ſhould be the object of Gods Reprobation. Again, if that ſinfulneſs, wherein it is pretended that God looked upon men, when He Reprobated them, was any ground or cauſe of ſuch his Reprobation, then was it a ground, or cauſe, <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> moving him hereunto: for other influence or efficiency upon him it could have none. If ſo, then 1. The Will of God may have a Cauſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to it, and productive of it; which is generally taken for an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. 2. If the ſinfulneſs of men foreſeen moved God <hi>morally</hi> to conceive or make a Decree of Reprobation againſt them, then was this Decree made by him in a way of Juſtice, and Equity; yea upon ſuch terms, that had He not made, or paſſed ſuch a Decree, upon the grounds and reaſons that were before him, He had been unjuſt. If ſo, there being the ſame Reaſon, why He ſhould paſs a like Decree againſt thoſe men alſo, who are now called his <hi>Elect,</hi> in as much as a like ſinfulneſs in them was foreſeen likewiſe by him from Eternity, He muſt be unjuſt, becauſe He hath not paſſed a like Decree againſt theſe. The truth is, that ſuch a Decree of Reprobation, as men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly notion in God, involves ſo many inextricable difficulties, palpable abſurdities (that I ſay not, intolerable Blaſphemies alſo) that my hope is, it will ſhortly <hi>mole mali ſui ruere,</hi> fall and ſink with the inſupportable weight of its own evil, in the mindes and judgments of men.

            <p>
               <hi>If Chriſt dyed not for all Men without exception, then is the Sin of</hi> Adam<note place="margin">§. 39. <hi>Argum. 12.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>more extenſive, or extenſive unto more, in a way of Condemnation and Death, then the Death of Chriſt, and the Grace given by Him unto the World, is in a way of Juſtification, and of Life.</hi> The Reaſon of this Conſequence is apparant: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> extended unto all Men without exception, in a way of Condemnation. Therefore I aſſume: <hi>But the Sin of</hi> Adam <hi>is not extenſive unto more in a way of Condemnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the Grace given by Chriſt is in a way of Juſtification.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>This latter Propoſition is clearly enough aſſerted by the Apoſtle, and this over and over. <hi>But not as the offence, ſo alſo is the free gift, [i. e.</hi> the free gift of Grace by <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto the World:] meaning, that the <hi>offence,</hi> or ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> did not operate ſo forcibly, or with ſo high an hand towards, or to, the Condemnation of Men, as the Grace given by <hi>Chriſt</hi> operateth towards, or to, the Juſtification, or Salvation of Men. For thus he explains himſelf in the words following. <hi>For if through the offence of one many be dead [i. e.</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, or liable unto death] <hi>much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 5. 15</note>. As if he ſhould have ſaid; there is great Reaſon to conceive and judg, that the <hi>grace of God,</hi> and <hi>the gift of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> thereby, ſhould be much more effectual to procure the <hi>Juſtification</hi> and Salvation <hi>of many,</hi> then the offence of one, the <hi>Condemnation of many;</hi> partly becauſe <hi>the offence of one,</hi> wrought onely
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:94900:277"/> in its own ſtrength and native tendency in bringing <hi>Condemnation and Death upon many,</hi> having onely the permiſſive Will of God, not his operative or deſigning Will, for, or towards, the Production of ſuch an effect; whereas the operative and projecting, or deſigning, Will of God, interpoſed, went along with, yea and magnified it ſelf in the gracious gift by <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> in order to the bringing of the Juſtification of Life <hi>upon,</hi> or unto, <hi>many;</hi> partly alſo, becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> being the eternal Son of God, conſecrated and given by the Father for this end and purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Life unto, or <hi>upon many, [i. e.</hi> to put many into ſuch an eſtate of Juſtification, wherein continuing, they ſhould live, or be ſaved] was a far more likely Perſon to carry on, and make good his engagement for the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of many, then <hi>Adam,</hi> being a weak Creature, and of an earthy frame, was to bring the Condemnation of Death <hi>upon many.</hi> Now to ſay, that <hi>by the offence of one,</hi> a far greater number of men, incomparably more, are <hi>made dead,</hi> [brought into an eſtate of Condemnation, and Death] then by the Grace of God, and by the gift of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> through this Grace, are brought into an eſtate of Juſtification, is quite to alter the Property of the Apoſtles arguing in this place, and to invert the expreſs tendency of it. For whereas his intent clearly is, to aſſert a far more emphatical likelyhood, or rationality, that the Grace of God in the gift of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhould operate and prevail to the Juſtification of many, and that accordingly it doth thus operate and prevail, then the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> to the Condemnation of many, ſuch an aſſertion as that mentioned, makes him to ſay (or at leaſt it ſelf ſaith) that, whether there be more likelyhood, or rationality, or no, that the Grace of God by <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould juſtifie <hi>many,</hi> then that the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould condemn <hi>many,</hi> yet for matter of fact it is otherwiſe: and that the grace of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> juſtifies a few onely, in compariſon, whereas the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> condemns all, without exception. To affirm, for the ſtrengthening of the Faith of Beleevers (upon which account, queſtionleſs, the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh it) that there is a far greater probability that <hi>many</hi> ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then that many ſhould be condemned by <hi>Adam,</hi> and yet to affirm withall, that, this probability notwithſtanding, <hi>many,</hi> yea all without exception, are condemned by <hi>Adam,</hi> and but a very few (comparatively) juſtified by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is to blow hot and cold with the ſame breath, and to pull down with the one hand, what a man builds up with the other.</p>
            <p>The commenſurableneſs, or coextenſiveneſs, of the Grace of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in order to the Juſtification of Men, with the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> in reſpect of the Condemnation of Men, is very pregnantly avouched, the ſecond, and third time alſo, by the ſame Apoſtle, in theſe ſubſequent Paſſages of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture. <hi>Therefore as by the offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men unto Juſtification of life. For as by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one many ſhall be made righteous</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18, 19</note>. In theſe two Verſes, the condemned ones of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the juſtified ones of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are (as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly obſerved <note n="k" place="margin">Cap 6, § 23</note>) computed by one and the ſame numerical expreſſion. In the former, we hear of the Condemnation of no more then ALL MEN by the offence of <hi>Adam;</hi> and of no fewer then <hi>All Men</hi> juſtified by <hi>Christ.</hi> In the latter, of no more, then MANY made <hi>Sinners</hi> by <hi>Adam;</hi> nor of any fewer then MANY made <hi>Righteous</hi> by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now as <hi>Peter</hi> was admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by a voyce from Heaven <hi>not to call that common, which God had clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>

            <p>Onely one thing we ſhall briefly add in this place. Whereas the Apoſtle<note place="margin">§. 40.</note> (in the latter of the two laſt recited Paſſages) expreſſeth the guilt contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ect by men from <hi>Adam,</hi> in a Verb ſignifying the time paſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, HAVE BEEN <hi>made Sinners,</hi> and the Righteouſneſs, or Juſtification, brought unto Men by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in a Verb of the future tenſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, SHALL BE <hi>made Righteous,</hi> which to ſome may ſeem to import, that the Apoſtle intends to make the juſtified ones of <hi>Christ</hi> in this place, no more, then thoſe who SHALL be actually juſtified and ſaved in the end, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which cannot be equal to thoſe made Sinners by <hi>Adam;</hi> I anſwer, 1. That the Juſtification accruing unto the World by <hi>Christ,</hi> is a little before, expreſſed in a Verb ſignifying the time paſt alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> where he ſaith (as we lately heard) that <hi>the Grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>

               <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 5, 15</note>. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the collection ſpecified, as iſſuing from the latter expreſſion mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is illegitimate and groundleſs. 2. <hi>Tremellius</hi> from the <hi>Syriac</hi> tranſlates the ſaid latter expreſſion in the Preſent-tenſe; <hi>Multi juſti fiunt, Many</hi> ARE <hi>made righteous;</hi> which notes onely the nature of the gracious tranſaction of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is, to make many righteous, not the event. 3. There is ſcarce any thing of a more common and known obſervation about the Scriptures, then the mutual enallage, or change of Tenſes, the Preſent being ſometimes put for the Preter, and ſometimes for the Future; and ſo theſe reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So that unleſs either the ſcope of the Place, or exigency of the ſentence, will enforce it otherwiſe, there is no building any Obſervation of weight, upon the Particularity of a Tenſe. Now the ſcope of the Place in hand is ſo far from enforcing any ſuch ſuppoſition as this, that the juſtified ones of Chriſt, ſpoken of in this Chapter, are onely thoſe, who ſhall be ſaved at laſt, that it enforceth the quite contrary, as hath been ſhewed. And for the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, it requireth no ſuch ſuppoſal upon any account whatſoever. But 4. (and laſtly) The Reaſon (I conceive) why the Apoſtle varyeth his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion about the Juſtification brought unto the World by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning it (in the latter place) in a Verb of the Future tenſe, whereas he had (in the ſame Period) expreſſed the guilt brought upon the World by <hi>Adam,</hi> in a Verb of the Preter-tenſe; the Reaſon (I ſay) hereof I conceive to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, it is more eaſily, and more generally beleeved, that guilt is come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World by <hi>Adam,</hi> then that Juſtification is come unto it by <hi>Christ.</hi> In which reſpect, he mentioneth the former, as a thing done, and generally ſo known and confeſſed to be: the latter, becauſe more queſtioned, and leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, he aſſerteth more vigorouſly and commandingly; the Future-tenſe being frequently in Scripture (as in other Writings alſo) imployed to carry ſtrong aſſertions, and ſtrict Commands. So that this Period of the Apoſtle, <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one,
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:94900:278"/> ſhall many he made righteous,</hi> may be paraphraſed thus: As you eaſily beleeve, and take it for granted, that by the diſobedience of one, many have been made ſinners, and ſo guilty of, and liable unto, Death, [<hi>i. e.</hi> that all Men, as they come reſpectively to be conceived and born, were made liable unto death, by the diſobedience of one long ſince acted, and ſhould have periſhed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhould not Grace have prevented it,] ſo certainly will it appear, and be found true, in due time, that many, even as many, yea the ſelf ſame, both number and Perſons, in their ſucceſſive conceptions alſo, and comings into the World, thoſe already born, and thoſe that hereafter ſhall be born, have been, and ſhall be, <hi>made righteous [i. e.</hi> have been, and ſhall be, delivered from the guilt of ſin, and liableneſs unto death] <hi>by the obedience of one, i. e.</hi> by the obedient and ſubmiſſive deportment of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> towards His Father, in yeelding of Himſelf up unto Death. In what ſence men may be, and are by the Apoſtle, ſaid to be, <hi>by nature children of wrath</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Eph. 2, 3</note>, and yet not liable unto condemnation, either in their reſpective conceptions, or births, ſhall (God aſſiſting) be argued and cleared in more convenient place. Onely at preſent (to ſtay ſtomacks) we ſay, 1. That the word, <hi>Nature,</hi> doth no where ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, either the natural conception, or the natural birth; nor always, if any where, partnerſhip, or communion, in the humane Nature, or a deſcent from <hi>Adam</hi> in the ordinary way of Propagation; but ſometimes an innate, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Principle in a man, one or more; as 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 14. Rom.</hi> 2. 14, &amp;c. ſometimes alſo, a courſe, or ſeries of actions, whereunto a man falleth and addicteth himſelf of his own accord, without any compulſion, or neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either from within or from without, through inconſiderateneſs, or the like; and ſo likewiſe the habit, or evil propenſion voluntarily contracted by ſuch actions; And in this ſence it may well be taken by the Apoſtle in the clauſe ſpecified, the carriage of the former part of the Verſe inviting unto it. So that men may be ſaid to be <hi>by nature children of wrath,</hi> when they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily follow, or ſuffer themſelves to be led by, ſuch ſinful inclinations, which are apt to breed or be ingendered in fleſh and blood, or in the <hi>Natures</hi> of Men. 2. <hi>By Nature,</hi> cannot ſignifie, by natural Birth, nor, by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the humane Nature, nor, by deſcent from <hi>Adam,</hi> or the like; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then it would follow, that all Children whatſoever, dying Infants, or Children, ſhould periſh everlaſtingly; at leaſt if by <hi>children of wrath,</hi> be meant, in an eſtate of Condemnation, or under the actual diſpleaſure of God: becauſe all partake alike of the natural Birth, of the Nature of Man, are of a like deſcent from <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Some ancient Expoſitors interpreted the word, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, verè, ſeu germane, i. e.</hi> truly, or indeed. 4. <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> Interpretation of the Place is of much affinity with that firſt mentioned. The Apoſtle (ſaith he) <hi>ſaith, we have provoked God, and made Him wroth, that is, we were wrath, and nothing elſe. For as he that is the childe of a man, is by nature a man: even ſo we alſo were children of wrath, even as others: that is, none was free, but we all did things deſerving wrath</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. 5. (And laſtly) By, <hi>children of wrath,</hi> the Apoſtle may very probably mean, Perſons that had been loſt, and were worthy wrath, or deſerving death. And thus <hi>Calvin</hi> interprets. <hi>By children of wrath</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>underſtand ſimply, ſuch as were lost, and worthy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Per filios irae, ſimpliciter intellige perditos, ac morte aeternâ dignos.</note>. According to the import of this Interpretation of the phraſe,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:94900:278"/> 
               <hi>children of wrath,</hi> all Men may truly be ſaid to be <hi>by nature [i. e.</hi> by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Propagation, or by their deſcent from <hi>Adam] children of wrath,</hi> and yet be born in an eſtate of Juſtification, or in an actual and immediate capacity of Salvation, by <hi>Christ.</hi> As it is with thoſe, who having arrived at years of diſcretion, and actually beleeve: they carry original defilement ſtill about with them; they were, in reſpect of what was derived unto them from <hi>Adam</hi> in their natural conception, and birth, wholly loſt, and are ſtill, notwithſtanding their Faith, in the rigor and ſtrictneſs of Juſtice, worthy of eternal death; and yet by means of their Faith, and the gracious Compact and Covenant, which God hath made with thoſe that beleeve, they are not in an eſtate of Condemnation, or liable to eternal Death. In like manner Children may poſſibly be conceived, and ſo born into the world, with origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, and yet not with, or under, the guilt of it: this may be diſſolved and taken away by the ſuperabounding Grace of God vouchſafed unto the World by <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> though the ſin it ſelf remaineth. So again: Children as ſoon as conceived or born, may be, and are, in ſtrictneſs of account, worthy of eternal Death by Reaſon of that communion they had in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his loyns when he ſinned: and yet this worthineſs may not be imputed unto them, or charged upon them, being (as we ſuppoſe it clear from the Scriptures) expiated, or attoned by the great Sacrifice of <hi>Christ</hi> in His Death. This Interpretation of the Apoſtles ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>We were by nature chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, even as others,</hi> is (I conceive) of all the reſt, leaſt liable to any material exception. But we have gone beyond the line of our late intentions, in following this chaſe. We retire, with a purpoſe to conclude this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with the addition onely of one Argument more for the confirmation of our main Doctrine. Therefore,</p>
            <p>In the thirteenth (and laſt place) The Univerſality of Redemption pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed<note place="margin">§. 41. <hi>Argum. 13.</hi>
               </note> by <hi>Christ</hi> I further argue and demonſtrate from the conſideration of ſome of the Principal Types under the Law, by which the compaſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited extent of it, was prefigured. I ſhall inſiſt onely upon two: the Brazen Serpent; and the Feaſt of <hi>Jubilee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Concerning the Brazen Serpent; our Saviour himſelf owneth and aſſerteth a typical correſpondency in the erection and uſefulneſs hereof, with himſelf, in reſpect of that great and gracious Deſign and Purpoſe of God in ſending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Him unto the World. <hi>And as Moſes</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>lifted up the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, That whoſoever beleeveth in Him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 3 14, 15</note>. A Type being a kinde of Similitude, and the property or condition of this not being (in the Proverbial expreſſion) <hi>to run on all four, i. e.</hi> to anſwer or hold proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all Particulars, indeed many times not in more, then one onely, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour, to prevent all miſunderſtanding, in the interpretation, or application of the Type mentioned, particularizeth that very reſpect or conſideration in himſelf, and his ſending into the World, which was prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured and expreſſed in the Type alledged by him, in theſe words, <hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beleeveth in Him, ſhould not periſh, &amp;c.</hi> To underſtand clearly what there was in the Type anſwering (in a way of pre-ſignification) that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming or ſending into the World, which himſelf here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon, as preſignified hereby, we muſt have recourſe to the Hiſtory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the erection of the Brazen Serpent, unto which alſo himſelf ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, in that Particle of compariſon, or reſemblance, <hi>As, As Moſes lifted up, &amp;c.</hi> The original of this Brazen Serpent, together with the Counſel and
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:94900:279"/> Intention of God in his Erection, <hi>Moſes</hi> recordeth thus. <hi>Make thee</hi> (ſaith He to <hi>Moſes) a fiery Serpent [viz.</hi> in ſimilitude or form] <hi>and ſet it upon a pole: and it ſhall come to paſs, that</hi> EVERY ONE THAT IS BITTEN, <hi>when He looketh upon it, ſhall live</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Numb. 21 8</note>. From which words it is moſt evident, that this <hi>fiery Serpent</hi> [in form, as <hi>Christ</hi> came <hi>in the ſimilitude of that ſinful fleſh,</hi> whoſe ſting is ſo mortal to the World] was not intended by God as a means of healing, or preſervation, to a certain, definite, or determinate number of Perſons, or that ſuch and ſuch by Name, and no other, ſhould look upon it, in order to their healing, or that whoſoever in the event did look upon it, and no other but theſe, ſhould be healed by it; but that whoſoever would, might look upon it, (for which end alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> was commanded to ſet it up on high upon <hi>a pole,</hi> where it might be readily viſible unto all,) and that whoſoever ſhould, or did, look upon it, being bitten, or ſtung, with any <hi>fiery Serpent,</hi> might be healed thereby. Now all Men without exception, being (as we all know, and confeſs) ſtung, and that mortally, with the <hi>fiery Serpent,</hi> Sin, unleſs <hi>Christ</hi> ſhould be lifted up [upon the Croſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Death] with an Intent on Gods part, 1. That every man, if he pleaſed, might beleeve in Him: And 2. That every man that ſhould beleeve in Him, ſhould be ſaved by Him, He ſhould altogether diſ-anſwer that famous Type we ſpeak of, and that in that very conſideration and reſpect, wherein He pleads a ſpecial conformity to it.</p>
            <p>If it be replyed; The correſpondency between <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Brazen Serpent, is ſufficiently ſalved in this; that as the Will and Ordinance of God, in, and about the Brazen Serpent, was, that whoſoever being ſtung, ſhould look up to it, ſhould be healed: ſo is it His good Pleaſure, in, and about <hi>Christ,</hi> that whoſoever beleeveth in Him, ſhould be ſaved from that Death, which ſin expoſeth him unto. But this doth not imply, or ſuppoſe, <hi>Christ</hi> to be an Univerſal Saviour, or Redeemer; I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Brazen Serpent was not ordained by God, to be a condition or means of healing by a looking up to it, onely unto thoſe, or for their ſakes, who actually did look up to it, and were healed by it (unleſs we ſhall ſuppoſe that all thoſe, without exception, who were ſtung of ſerpents, did look up to it, and were accordingly healed, which would be a ſuppoſition without ſufficient ground,) but unto all thoſe, without exception, and for their ſakes, who were, or any time after ſhould be, thus ſtung, whether they would, or ſhould look up to it for healing, or no. Nor do we finde, in the words of the Inſtitution of it (lately ſpecified) the leaſt whiſper or intimation of any exception of Perſons in this kinde. Therefore unleſs it be admitted, that <hi>Christ</hi> dyed as well for thoſe, or for their ſakes, who, being ſinners (as all are) do not, or ſhall not, beleeve in Him, as for thoſe who do, or ſhall, He will not fulfil the Type we ſpeak of, no not in that conſideration, wherein the richneſs and fulneſs of his Grace was in ſpecial manner typified (as Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in the words lately tranſcribed from his own mouth, plainly enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be granted, that this is the Will, or Intent of God, that whoſoever beleeveth, or ſhall beleeve, in Him, ſhall be ſaved, it amounts to as much, in expreſſneſs of conſequence and import, as we contend for; <hi>viz.</hi> that there is Salvation purchaſed and procured by Him for all Men, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For that which is to be had upon the performance of ſuch a condition, which being performed, gives no Being to it, muſt of neceſſity have a Being there, where, or from whence it is to be had upon the performance of this
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:94900:279"/> condition, whether this condition be performed, or no. If it be true, that in caſe I ſhall go up into the Chamber, I ſhall meet my Friend, or Brother, there, it muſt needs be true, that my Friend, or Brother, is there, whether I go up to meet him there, or no. In like manner, if this be a truth, that in caſe I ſhall beleeve on <hi>Christ,</hi> I ſhall finde Salvation for my ſelf in Him, it muſt of neceſſity be every whit as true, that there is Salvation in Him for me, whether I beleeve in Him, or no: becauſe my beleeving in Him, would not create any Salvation in Him, more then what was in Him before. So that if it were not in Him, before my beleeving, I could not have it, I ſhould not finde it in Him, though I ſhould beleeve. But the legitimacy of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence we ſpeak of, from the Premiſſes unto which we relate it, and which are our Adverſaries own reſolute Doctrine, we have argued and evicted at large, and this more then once, in our former Diſcuſſions <note n="s" place="margin">See Cap. 7. Sect. 2, 3, &amp;c. and Cap. 8. 31 §. 42.</note>.</p>
            <p>Again, The other great Type we mentioned, of the Redemption purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Christ</hi> for the World, the Feaſt of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> plainly proveth this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to have been, in the purchaſe and procurement of it, general, or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, however in the actual Poſſeſſion, or enjoyment of it, it proves the benefit, or bleſſing onely of a few, by means of the non-acceptation of it by the greateſt part of thoſe, for whom it was purchaſed. That the Feaſt of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee</hi> under the Law, was a Type, and that of a moſt clear and ſignificant import, of the ſpiritual Liberty and Freedom from Sin and Miſery, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by <hi>Christ,</hi> and proclaimed by God in the Goſpel unto the World, is the ſtanding Notion and ſence of all Parties in the preſent Controverſies. The Tenor of the Inſtitution of this Feaſt, as far as concerns the buſineſs in hand, runneth thus. <hi>And ye ſhall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim Liberty throughout all the Land, unto</hi> ALL <hi>the Inhabitants thereof: it ſhall be a Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee unto you, and ye ſhall return</hi> EVERY MAN <hi>unto His Poſſeſsion, and y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſhall return</hi> EVERY MAN <hi>unto His Family</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Lev. 25. 10</note>. And a little after: <hi>In the year of this Iubilee ye ſhall return</hi> EVERY MAN <hi>unto His Poſſeſsion</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Verſe 13</note>. This <hi>returning of every man to His poſſeſsion,</hi> is (ſaith Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ainſworth</hi>) a <hi>figure of our reſtoring by Chriſt into Paradiſe, the Poſſeſsion whereof</hi> Adam <hi>loſt by ſin.</hi> And (by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion) <hi>the returning of every man to His Family [i. e.</hi> to his civil liberty and freedom] is a figure of our reſtoring by <hi>Christ</hi> unto that ſpiritual liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or freedom from under the dominion and power of ſin, with all the hard conſequences of ſuch a bondage, whereof we were all deprived by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Adams</hi> ſin. Now the Tenor of the Counſel and Intentions of God in the Erection or Inſtitution of this Feaſt, we ſee expreſly to be, the eaſe, benefit, reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to poſſeſſions, and liberties, of EVERY MAN, without the exception of any. Yea all ſervants that had refuſed their liberty at the end of the ſeventh year of their ſervice, which their Maſters were expreſly enjoyned by the Law <note n="x" place="margin">Exod. 21. 6</note> to grant unto them, if they deſired it, had the benefit and indulgence of the <hi>Iubilee,</hi> and were then to be manumized or ſet at liberty, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it, as well as others; which plainly ſignified the riches of the Grace of God in the Goſpel to be ſo great, that even wilful ſinners, and ſuch as have waxen old in ways of provocation, are hereby made capable of the love and favor of God in the Pardon of all their ſins. For (to note this by the way) the Intent of this Feaſt was not (I ſuppoſe) to compel, or neceſſitate <hi>every man,</hi> no nor yet any man, to return either to his Poſſeſſion, or to his Family, whether they would or no, but to afford them an opportunity, and to inveſt them with a liberty, or right, of returning unto either, if they pleaſed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe, it had been leſs matter of gratification, eaſe, or indulgence
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:94900:280"/> unto men, yea poſſibly unto ſome, as <hi>viz.</hi> unto thoſe, who had been found unwilling to return unto either, it had been matter of trouble and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </lg>
            <p>But to the Point in hand. It being the clear and unqueſtionable intent of God, in, and by the great and ſolemn Feaſt of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> to loſe the two ſore yokes, of Bondage and Poverty, from off all necks whatſoever, without any difference or diſtinction of perſons, in one kinde, or other, He ſhould be far more gracious and munificent in Type, or Shadow, then in Subſtance, in caſe He ſhould not be every whit as large, free, and comprehenſive in His Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of affording means and opportunity unto men for deliverance from ſin and death by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be objected; It is true, the intent of the <hi>Jubilee</hi> was to inveſt <hi>every man [viz.</hi> that was a <hi>Jew,</hi> and of the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi>] with a right of power to return to his poſſeſſion, or family: But not to gratifie every man ſimply, or to indulge the like priviledg unto all the World. Therefore this rather proves the confinement of the Intentions of the Grace of God in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> unto his Church, or Elect onely, then the enlargement of them unto all the World; eſpecially conſidering, that the whole body of the People and Nation of the Jews, were typical, and preſignified the Church, or Churches, which were afterwards to be raiſed up amongſt the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be it granted, that the Body or Nation of the Jews, did typifie the Church or Churches of the Gentiles, yet did not every ſingle perſon of this Nation typifie a true member of theſe Churches. As for example, <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi> did not typifie a true Saint, or a Beleever under the Goſpel, nor did <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> typifie ſo many godly or holy men among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> nor had any unrighteous or wicked Perſon of this Nation the Honor of typing out any true <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> or Elect Perſon, under the New Teſtament. If ungodly perſons among the <hi>Jews</hi> were Types of any thing, it was of ſuch Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites or profane Perſons, that ſhould be found in the Churches under the Goſpel. And if ſo, the intent of the <hi>Jubilee,</hi> being (as we have proved from the expreſs letter of the Inſtitution of it) for the benefit, comfort, and eaſe of <hi>every man</hi> amongſt them, as well of the wicked and unholy, as of the holy and righteous, it follows roundly, that this typified and taught, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of God, in, and about the Salvation afforded and exhibited by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> unto the World, ſtood equal and indifferent towards all Men without exception, without any diſtinction of holy and unholy, righteous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, Elect and Reprobate, or the like.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Although the Law of <hi>Jubilee</hi> (as the whole Ceremonial Law in all the parts and branches of it) was given particularly UNTO the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet was it not given particularly FOR the <hi>Iews, i. e.</hi> for the ſake, or benefit, of the <hi>Iews</hi> onely, but for the accommodation and benefit of all the World beſides. And upon this account (I ſuppoſe) the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Injunctions by <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>diments,</hi> not of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but <hi>of the World</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Col. 2. 8. 20</note>; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they were given with an intent on Gods part to nurture and breed up the World, <hi>i. e.</hi> all Nations as well as the <hi>Iews,</hi> in ſuch a meaſure or degree of the knowledg of the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> then to come,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:94900:280"/> which He judged meet to impart unto the World until His coming. So that how ſoever the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Nation was honored by God above all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in being made by Him Feoffees in truſt (as it were) for the World, and had the keeping of the Oracles of Life committed unto them, yet had they no right or lawfulneſs of power, to deny any Perſon under Heaven part or fellowſhip with them in any of their ſpiritual Priviledges, who ſhould deſire it of them in a due and regular way, and turn Proſelyte. Now there was no Perſon of any Nation, that was made by God uncapable of the benefit or bleſſing of Proſelytiſm: and conſequently the Joy and Priviledges accruing unto Men by vertue of the Law and Feaſt of <hi>Iubilee,</hi> did, though not in ſo immediate and direct a way, concern all other Nations, and Perſons, as well as the <hi>Iews,</hi> or natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Even as the Goſpel, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Adminiſtrations annexed thereunto, in theſe days, are onely poſſeſſed and enjoyed, in, and by the Churches of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but yet they are ſo, and upon ſuch terms, poſſeſſed and enjoyed by them, that whoſoever from amongſt the moſt Idolatrous and Heatheniſh Nation under Heaven, ſhall beleeve, may and ought to have communion with them in ſuch their Poſſeſſions and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Either of theſe Anſwers is ſufficient to looſen the joynts of the loyns of the Objection.</p>
            <p>The Arguments and Grounds layd down and managed in this Chapter, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thoſe Paſſages and Texts of Scripture, which we have heard ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo diſtinctly and aloud, the ſame things with them, have turned my thoughts and Judgment about the Intentions of God in the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> upſide down, and have filled me, Minde, Heart, Soul, and Conſcience, with this Belief, that theſe Intentions of His ſtand, and always ſtood, equally, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, and uniformly bent, for, or towards the Salvation of the World, without any difference or variation in reſpect of any man, or numbers of men, conſidered ſimply as men, or as having done neither good, nor evil. Yet are there three things more that have made my Belief in this kinde <hi>meaſure heaped up, preſſed down,</hi> and <hi>running over.</hi> The firſt is, that <hi>Conjunctio magna,</hi> that great conjunction of all, or far the greateſt part of the chief Luminaries in the Firmament of the Chriſtian Church, whileſt the conſtitution of it was yet more athletique, healthful and ſound (I mean, during the Primitive Times) the multiplied rays or beams of whoſe light concentred in the ſame Point of Doctrine with us. Of this we ſhall, God aſſiſting, give ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent account in the fore-part of the Chapter following. The ſecond is, the frequent Teſtimony given to this Doctrine by thoſe, who are (or at leaſt are ſo eſteemed) the chief Adverſaries and Oppoſers of it, who (as appears from their Writings) are oft neceſſitated to aſſert or own it, as a Principle, without which, they know not, in many caſes, how to make a conſiſtent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or manage the Theam they have before them. Somewhat of this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we ſhall ſhew in the latter Part of the ſaid Chapter. The third (and laſt) is the apparant inconcludency and weakneſs of thoſe arguings and reaſonings, whether from the Scriptures, or other Principles, by which the cauſe of the contrary Opinion is wont by the ableſt Patrons it hath (as far as men of this engagement are yet known unto me) to be pleaded and maintained. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of this is deſigned for the ſubject matter of the ſecond Part of this Work, if God ſhall vouchſafe to make his Sun to ſhine a birth-day for it.</p>

               <p>Wherein the Sence of Antiquity, together with the variableneſs of Judgment in modern Writers, touching the Controverſie under diſcuſſion, is truly and unpartially repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>FOr their ſakes, who are afraid to beleeve any thing, what pregnancy of<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> ground ſoever there be to evince the truth of it otherwiſe, but onely what they know, or at leaſt think, that many other men, and theſe ſome ways honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their ſight, have beleeved before them, I have ſubjoyned this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to thoſe large debates, which finiſhed their courſe in the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Book, managed (I truſt) to the ſatisfaction of all ſuch, who count it more ſafe to ſtand upon a rock alone, or with a few, then upon a quagmire or quickſand, with a greater company. But becauſe all Men have not this Faith, I ſhall ſhew unto thoſe that want it, a cloud of as honorable Perſons (I ſuppoſe) even in their own eyes, as any that have inhabited Mortality ſince the Apoſtles days, ſtanding upon the Rock of that Doctrine, which hath been aſſerted, and recommended in our former Diſcuſſions. For who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that compaſs of time we ſpeak of, have had a ſpirit of greater glory reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them, then thoſe that ſate in the Apoſtles Chairs, next after them, and were Pillars of light and fire in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, in her Primitive and pureſt days? And that theſe in their reſpective ſtations, and ſucceſſive generations, were not onely Partakers, but Defenders and Aſſertors of the ſame Faith with us in the Doctrine of Redemption, hitherto maintained, is legible enough in the next enſuing Teſtimonies: after which we ſhall ſhew how fluctuating and inconſiſtent with themſelves the Judgments of later Writers have been about the ſaid Doctrine, and how unpoſſible it is for any man to be of an eſtabliſhed Conſcience therein, that ſhall build himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Authority.</p>
            <p>We ſhall begin with <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> the firſt born amongſt the Fathers, though not in time, yet in worth, and Name: and from him, proceed firſt unto thoſe that lived before him, by a gradual aſcent: and then to thoſe that ſucceeded him, by a deſcent anſwerable.

But that myſtical Sun of Righteouſneſs is riſen unto</hi> [or, for] <hi>ALL MEN, is come to ALL MEN, hath ſuffered</hi> FOR <hi>ALL MEN, and is riſen again</hi> FOR <hi>ALL MEN: and hath therefore ſuffered, that He might take away the ſin of the World. But if any man beleeveth not in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth Himſelf of the GENERAL BENEFIT, as if a man by ſhutting the windows, ſhould ſhut out the beams of the Sun, it doth not prove, that therefore the Sun is not riſen upon, or unto all, becauſe ſuch a man depriveth Himſelf of His Heat. But as for what concerneth the Sun, He keeps His Prerogative: but this man acteth the part of an unwiſe man in ſhutting out</hi> [from Himſelf] <hi>the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the common light.</hi> And a little before He had ſaid: <hi>The Earth is full of the Mercy of the Lord, becauſe Forgiveneſs of Sins is granted</hi> [or given] <hi>unto ALL MEN</hi>

            <p>That further may be taken into conſideration (by occaſion of the former part of this quotation) that it was the Judgment and Sence of the Ancient Fathers and Chriſtians generally (I know none to be excepted) that in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm there was always a particular application made to the Perſon baptized of the general Redemption purchaſed by <hi>Christ,</hi> ſo that he that was baptized, if an Infant, received thereby exemption and deliverance from the guilt of original Sin derived from <hi>Adam:</hi> if a Perſon of mature years, not onely this, but forgiveneſs alſo of all his actual ſins committed formerly. For which Opinion, though I do not as yet ſee any demonſtrative ground, either in the Scriptures, or in Reaſon, and (God ſparing me life to finiſh the ſecond part of this Work) I ſhall in one Particular declare my ſence in oppoſition to it; yet the Opinion (I confeſs) ſo far taketh with me, partly for the Proofs ſake which are produced (with ſome probability) for it, partly for the ſignal learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gifts, ſharpneſs of judgment, quickneſs of apprehenſion, and above all for the ſingular piety and zeal for the Truth found in ſo many Aſſertors of it, partly alſo for thoſe degrees of inevidence and inconcludency which are found in the Arguments uſually inſiſted upon to prove the contrary, that my Soul cannot enter into the ſecret of thoſe, who upon a confident preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the ſaid Opinion is erroneous, refuſe to offer their children unto Baptiſm; hereby, according to the ſence of all the Fathers (as hath been in effect ſaid) expoſing their precious Souls to a certain loſs of Salvation by <hi>Christ,</hi> in caſe they dye before they come to years of diſcretion.

Now then if their meaning in the ſaid Symbol were, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>incarnate, made Man, ſuffered, &amp;c.</hi> onely for ſuch Perſons, who were Elect (as ſome call Election,) ſuch (I mean) who ſhould be actually ſaved, and not for the generality of Men; one of the two muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed; Either, 1. That they judged all Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> to be <hi>Elect</hi> (in this ſence,) and conſequently ſuch as ſhould be ſaved: Or elſe, 2. That they intended, that men ſhould make Profeſſion of their Faith at peradventure, and profeſs that they beleeved that, which they knew not whether it was true, or no, and ſo could have no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to beleeve it. Yea and that many ſhould make ſuch a Profeſſion, wherein the event would certainly prove them to have lyed both unto God and Men when they made it. For certain it is, and demonſtrable from the Scriptures, that all that profeſs Chriſtianity in the World, will not at laſt be ſaved.

Queſtionleſs if men be duly and ſufficiently convinced, or be in capacity of this conviction, that negligence is, or was, the onely reaſon, or cauſe, why ſuch or ſuch a thing, is not, or was not, performed by them, it muſt be ſuppoſed that ſuch men have, or had, ſufficient ſtrength, or means, to have performed it. For if men certainly know that they have not, or had not, a ſufficiency of means or ſtrength for the performance of a thing, it is unpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that they ſhould ever be convinced that onely negligence was the cauſe of their non-performance of it. The Reaſon is, becauſe a knowledg, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that the performance of a thing is unpoſſible, in reſpect of a mans weakneſs, or want of ſtrength to perform it, is a certain cauſe of his non-at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting it, and conſequently of his non-performing it: So that negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in this caſe cannot be the onely cauſe of his non-performance: nay the truth is that negligence is no cauſe hereof at all. Suppoſe a man doth neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to try, or to uſe means that he may fly like a bird in the ayr, yet this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of his cannot reaſonably be looked upon as any cauſe of his not-flying: but his inability to fly, in conjunction with a certain knowledg of ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability in him, and of the invincibleneſs hereof, is the adequate and ſole cauſe of his not-flying.</p>

And beſides, that God ſhould not be willing that a man ſhould be redeemed and ſaved by <hi>Christ,</hi> when as the man himſelf is truly willing in this kinde, is a ſaying of a notorious inconſiſtency with truth; conſidering that the willingneſs of any man in this kinde, muſt of neceſſity proceed from a willingneſs in God ſemblable to it.

            <p>For the finiſhing of the Chapter in hand, and (upon the matter) of this<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> firſt Part of our Diſcourſe, it remaineth onely that I deſire the unpartial Reader, ſeriouſly, and as in the Preſence of God, to conſider, whether the Teſtimonies and Sayings, which ſhall be preſented unto Him (in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of this Chapter) out of the Writings of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſome other principal men, that are generally looked upon as Followers of His Doctrine, and conſequently, as Adverſaries to the Great Doctrine of Univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion maintained in this Diſcourſe, whether (I ſay) theſe Teſtimonies and Sayings do not evince above, and beyond all contradiction, that theſe men were not ſo through, uniform, ſetled, or conſiſtent with themſelves in their Judgments about the Doctrine of Redemption, as men had need be, whoſe Authority &amp; Judgments are commonly taken for the Standard of other Mens Faith, and judged little leſs then equal to the <hi>Foundations of the Prophets and Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, in matters of Religion. Certain I am that the frequent and notorious inconſiſtencies that occur in their Writings about the Great Article of the Chriſtian Faith, ſo much argued and debated in our preſent Diſcourſe, have miniſtred an unhappy advantage to ſome of our Adverſaries of the Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> to elevate and expoſe to contempt, the Credit, Worth, Learning, Authority, of the Principal Supporters and Defenders of the Proteſtant Religion <note n="r" place="margin">

The onely prize that we run for in the preſent race, is ſo far to reduce and temper their Eſteem and Authority with us, that on the one hand what was worthy, and of God, in them, may turn to an happy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto us, and bleſs us; and on the other hand, that what was weak, and of men, in them, may not inſnare us, or balance the ſpiritual commodity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing to us from what was honorable and beneficent in them, with loſs and diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>I begin with <hi>Calvin</hi> Himſelf: and humbly deſire thoſe, that oppoſe His<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> Judgment and Authority to obſtruct the courſe of the Doctrine avouched in this Diſcourſe, leſt it ſhould <hi>run and be glorified</hi> as Truth ought to be, to conſider whether theſe Paſſages and Sayings next enſuing, be with it, and for it, or againſt it. <hi>Although</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>there is nothing to be found in the World worthy the Favor of God, yet He ſheweth himſelf</hi> PROPITIOVS [or favorable] UNTO THE WHOLE WORLD, <hi>in that</hi> He <hi>calls</hi> ALL MEN WITHOVT EXCEPTION <hi>to beleeve in Chriſt, which is nothing elſe but an entrance into life</hi>

<pb n="553" facs="tcp:94900:295"/> Certainly if Gods <hi>calling of All Men without exception</hi> to beleeve in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be a ſufficient argument, or ſign, of His propitious and favorable inclination towards them, He muſt needs really intend the grace, or good of Salvation unto them: otherwiſe His calling of them to beleeve, as namely if it ſhould be accompanyed with a Purpoſe or Intent in Him, either ſimply to deſtroy them, or to increaſe their deſtruction, would rather argue His Hatred, then any propitiouſneſs of affection towards them. And if God intends the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all Men without exception, certainly He hath provided Salvation in <hi>Chriſt</hi> for them all. Elſewhere the ſame Author ſaith, that <hi>although Chriſt ſuffered for the ſins of the</hi> WHOLE WORLD, <hi>and be through the</hi> KINDNESS [or good will] OF GOD INDIFFERENTLY OFFERED UNTO ALL MEN, <hi>yet all Men do not receive</hi> [or take hold on] <hi>Him</hi>

               </note>. Queſtionleſs if an Expoſitor of Scripture meets with a figurative term, or expreſſion (I mean, ſo apprehended by him) in the Text which is before him, and which he is about to open, it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for him to uſe the ſame word in the ſame figurative or unproper ſence, in his Expoſition, eſpecially without giving any notice of the figurativeneſs of it, or ſubſtituting a word of a more plain and ready ſignification for the explaining of it. Therefore if <hi>Calvin,</hi> by the word, <hi>World, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 19. underſtood, the Elect of God onely, diſperſed up and down the World, he would not in his Expoſition, have uſed the ſame word to expreſs them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially without the help of ſome other, one, or more, of a more plain and known ſignification in that kinde. So that there is not the leaſt queſtion, but that he, both in the Text mentioned, as likewiſe in his Commentaries upon it, underſtood the word, <hi>World,</hi> in the ordinary and beſt known ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the generality or univerſality of Men. Upon the ſame Scripture afterwards he demands, <hi>For what purpoſe did God appear unto Men in Christ?</hi> He anſwereth and ſaith, <hi>For Reconciliation, that, Enmities being taken out of the way,</hi> THOSE THAT WERE ESTRANGED [from Him] <hi>might be adopted for Sons.</hi> Now they that were eſtranged from God, were not the Elect onely, but the whole Univerſe of Mankinde with them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to the expreſs import of this piece of Commentary, God
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:94900:296"/> deſigned in Chriſt the Adoption of all Men without exception, for Sons.

            <p>I ſhall not (I truſt) need here to re-inculcate that, which hath been, and<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> this more then once, ſo plainly expreſſed formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> that my intent in citing <hi>Calvin,</hi> with thoſe other late Proteſtant Writers which we have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in the ſame ſuffrage of Doctrine unto Him, in favor of the Doctrine of General Redemption, is not to perſwade the Reader, that the habitual or ſtanding Judgment, either of Him, or of the greater part of the reſt, was whole and entire for the ſaid Doctrine, or ſtood in any great propenſion hereunto (though this I verily beleeve concerning ſundry of them) much leſs to imply, that they never, in other places of their Writings, declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt it; but onely to ſhew, 1. That the truth of this Doctrine is ſo neer at hand; and, 2. That the influence of it is ſo benign and accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto many other Truths and Doctrines in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, that it is an hard matter for thoſe that deal much in theſe affairs, not to aſſume and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it ever and anon, and to ſpeak and argue many things upon the account of the Authority of it; yea though <hi>extrà caſum neceſsitatis</hi> on the one hand, and

            </p>
            <p>Let us draw up the Sum total of the Chapter, in a very few words, and ſo end it. Firſt we have ſeen the roots of that Doctrine held forth in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſcourſe, throughly watered with the faireſt ſtreams of the Judgment, Learning, Approbation, and Authority of the Primitive Times. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, concerning Times of a later date, we have found that the Judgment and Faith of that party of Proteſtant Churches and Writers, which is known by the Name of <hi>Lutheran,</hi> do more generally, if not univerſally, accord with the ſame Doctrine. Thirdly, and laſtly, that the other party of theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Writers, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe, who incline more to the Sence and Judgment of <hi>Calvin</hi> in matters of Chriſtian concernment, together with <hi>Calvin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, doth very frequently atteſt the ſame Doctrine, yea and cannot well want the ſervice and aſſiſtance of it in the managing and carrying on many of their affairs. The reſult of all is, that no conſidering, or conſcientious Perſon whatſoever, hath the leaſt occaſion to decline, or keep aloof off in Judgment from the ſaid Doctrine, for want of company, ſo great a number (as we have ſeen) of the beſt and moſt deſirable (for Companions in the way of Faith) of thoſe, that have dwelt with fleſh and blood, ſince the Apoſtles days, having given the right hand of fellowſhip unto it in their reſpective generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

               <p>The Concluſion: exhibiting a general Propoſal, or Survey, of Matters intended for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, Explication, and Debate, in the ſecond Part of this Work.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THough <hi>Christ</hi> the Lord reigneth, whileſt His Enemies are yet unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> and not put under His Feet, yet He reigneth not ſo like unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor with that peaceableneſs, or deſirableneſs of Government, unto His Subjects, as He ſhall, and will, reign, (at leaſt in the glorious reſult of His Mediation) when all that, which in any degree oppoſeth Him in His Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſhall be wholly taken out of the way, and no Enemy left with any ſtrength or power to infeſt, trouble, or cauſe the leaſt diſquietment or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content in all His Kingdom. In like manner, though the Judgment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a man may reign with much contentment and ſatisfaction, in the holding and Profeſſion of many a Truth, by the demonſtrative evidence and ſtrength of ſuch Arguments and Grounds, upon which He clearly ſeeth it built, however He may ſee it alſo encompaſſed and aſſaulted on every ſide with ſuch Objections and Difficulties, which are not at preſent ſubdued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; yet can they not be ſo well apayd, ſo full of Peace and Joy in this their Kingdom, as they may, and will, when theſe Objections ſhall be made to bow down before them, and lick the duſt at their fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and all Difficulties be perfectly reconciled with that Truth, which they hold and profeſs in this kinde. Upon this account, having in the Precedure of our Diſcourſe, ſetled this Great Doctrine, That <hi>Christ gave Himſelf a Ranſom for all Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception,</hi> upon ſuch Pillars of Scripture, Reaſon, and Authority, that no man that ſhall duly weigh the Premiſſes, can reaſonably queſtion the Truth thereof; I judged it neceſſary nevertheleſs (God not laying my Intentions in the duſt by the hand of Death, or otherwiſe) to ſubjoyn the Vindication of
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:94900:300"/> the ſaid Doctrine, from all ſuch Objections, Exceptions, or Encumbrances, wherewith I finde it on every ſide oppugned, and the courſe of it much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Mindes and Judgments of ſome: that ſo they who are, or ſhall be perſwaded of the truth of it, may ſit with ſo much the more eaſe in their Judgments, and reign in the happy Contemplation and Enjoyment of ſo bleſſed a Truth, with ſo much the more Peace and Joy.</p>
            <p>In our intended Vindication of the ſaid Doctrine, or ſecond Part of this<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> Work, we ſhall (God graciouſly continuing His aſſiſtance) perform theſe three things. Firſt, We ſhall deliver thoſe Texts, and Contexts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, contrary to their mindes, and native tendencies and imports re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, are compelled to ſerve againſt the ſaid Doctrine, theſe (I ſay) we ſhall (in the firſt place) deliver from this hard ſervice, by looſing the bands of ſuch Interpretations, wherein they are detained upon that account. Secondly, We ſhall ſhew, how the ſuppoſed Iron and Steel of ſuch Grounds, Arguments, and Reaſonings, wherewith the ſaid Doctrine commonly is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, are <hi>turned into ſtubble and rotten wood</hi> before it. Thirdly and laſtly, We ſhall give ſome general and brief Anſwer to ſuch Paſſages and Sayings, which are uſually alledged and cited from the Ancient Writers, in way of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Scriptures, which are commonly preſſed to ſerve in that warfare we ſpeak of, the truth is, that (as notice hath been formerly given) there is none of them can be brought to ſpeak any thing at all (no not in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) againſt the Doctrine we plead, but onely by the mediation of ſome deduction or inference raiſed and drawn from them by the Reaſons of Men. There is no Scripture that hath yet been, or indeed can be, produced, wherein it is either affirmed, that <hi>Christ</hi> dyed onely for the Elect, onely for Beleevers, or the like; or denyed, that He dyed for all Men without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The particular Places which are commonly managed with greateſt confidence in the Actors, and with moſt applauſe in the Spectators, againſt the ſaid Doctrine, are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mat. 20. 28. The Son of Man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to minister, and to give His Life a Ranſom for many.</hi> Unto which ſeveral others of like phraſe and expreſſion, are wont to be added, as (<hi>viz.) Mat. 26. 28. Rom. 5. 15, 19. Heb.</hi> 9. 28, &amp;c. From theſe Scriptures (with their fellows) ſuch an Argument as this is levyed:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that gave his Life a Ranſom for many, ſhed his Blood for many for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion</hi>

               <hi>of ſins, made many righteous, &amp;c. did not give his Life a Ranſom for all, did not ſhed his Blood for all for the Remiſsion of ſins, &amp;c. But</hi> Chriſt <hi>gave his Life a Ranſom for many, ſhed his Blood for many, &amp;c. Ergo.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mat. 1. 21.—Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus: for He ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> This Text likewiſe is wont to be ſeconded with ſome others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Acta Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodi Dordrec. part. 2. p. 97</note> as ſembling with it: as <hi>Acts 10. 43.—that through his Name, whoſoever beleeveth in him, ſhall receive Remiſsion of ſins.</hi> So alſo <hi>Rom. 3. 25. &amp;</hi> 10. 4.
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:94900:301"/> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9, &amp;c. Upon theſe, and ſuch like foundations, this Inference is built: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt <hi>came to ſave his People onely, Beleevers onely, ſanctified ones only, from their ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joh. 15. 13. Greater Love then this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his Friend.</hi> This I finde paralleld and ſtrengthened with theſe words (from the ſame Pen, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 16.) Hereby perceive we the Love of God, becauſe He</hi>

               <hi>layd down his life for us.</hi> This pair of Scriptures afford unto ſome the Joy of this Conſequence: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt <hi>did not lay down his Life for Reprobates, or for thoſe that are damned in Hell, becauſe then he ſhould love them with the greateſt Love that could be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joh. 17. 9. I pray for them: I pray not for the World.</hi> Upon this Baſis, this<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom. 8. 32. He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> From hence the Doctrine of particular Redemption is countenanced with this Argument. <hi>Unto all thoſe, for whom God ſpared not, but delivered up his own Son for them, he will freely give all things. But there are many thouſands in the World unto whom God will not give all things.</hi> Ergo, <hi>for none of theſe did God deliver up his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to theſe Arguments and Deductions pretending legitimacy of deſcent<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> from the recited Scriptures reſpectively, we ſhall clearly demonſtrate the nullity of ſuch their claim, and prove, that they have neither footing nor foundation in any the Premiſſes. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Beſides the recited Pleas againſt the Doctrine of General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, claiming ſuch an immediate intereſt as hath been repreſented, in the Scriptures, there are many others ſeemingly confederate with ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Principles and Grounds both of Reaſon, and Religion, and bearing themſelves upon the Scriptures alſo, though in ſomewhat a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote way. The moſt conſiderable, and thoſe inſiſted upon with greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by the Adverſaries of the ſaid Doctrine, are theſe following. Such of them as I finde in the Writings of men of Worth and Name, I ſhall ſet down with their reſpective Authors, or Abettors, noted in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
            <p>
               <q>

               <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Reaſon of the Conſequence (as to the firſt branch of it) is, becauſe ſatisfaction being made for any mans ſins, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains nothing further neceſſary to his actual diſcharge, or Salvation, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the performance of the Condition, upon which the application of the ſaid Satisfaction is ſuſpended. The Reaſon of the latter branch of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:94900:302"/> is, becauſe if Satisfaction was made by Chriſt upon none other terms for ſome, then it was for all, it clearly follows, that in caſe there be a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a non-application of it unto ſome, there is a like poſſibility unto all: and conſequently, a poſſibility of the Non-ſalvation, or, of the Damnation, of all. The Minor ſtands (it ſeems) upon this bottom; that thoſe, whom God the Father hath given unto Chriſt to be redeemed and ſaved by Him, of neceſſity muſt, and ſhall, be redeemed and ſaved by Him: and thoſe whom He hath not given unto Him upon ſuch an account (which are far the greater part of men) muſt by a like neceſſity, periſh, or be damned, as not being redeemed by Him, nor given unto Him to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If the Will and Intention of the Father, the Obedience and Oblation<note place="margin">10 Reaſon.</note> of the Son, and the ſaving Operation of the Holy Ghoſt, or Effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Calling, or Sanctification, be of one and the ſame compaſs, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, then did not Chriſt dye for all men:</q> But all the three Particulars<note place="margin">Acta Synodi Dordt. part 2 p. 94</note> mentioned are of one and the ſame compaſs, or commenſurable. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Reaſon of the Conſequence is evident: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the ſaving operation of the Holy Ghoſt, or effectualneſs of calling, are not extended unto all Men. The Minor builds upon this <hi>Sorites:</hi> The Father gives only his Elect, whom alone He loves, to be redeemed by His Son: The Son onely redeems thoſe that are thus given unto Him, as being thoſe whom alone He loves: The Holy Ghoſt, being the Love of the Father and the Son, ſanctifies onely the Elect of the Father, and the Redeemed of the Son.</p>

               </q> But no man wittingly and knowingly payeth<note place="margin">Acta Synodi Dordr. part 2 p. 94</note> ſuch a price upon ſuch terms. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Reaſon of the Sequel in the Major Propoſition, is, becauſe <hi>Christ</hi> knew cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h: and upon this account it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together irrational to ſuppoſe that He dyed for them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all Men without exception, then now in Heaven He<note place="margin">12 Reaſon.</note> intercedeth for all Men without exception. But He intercedeth not for all Men.</q> 
               <hi>Ergo.</hi> This latter Propoſition fears no contradiction, and therefore<note place="margin">Acta Synodi Dordr. part 2 p. 100. Collat. Hagienſ. p. 132</note> ſtands by its own ſtrength. The Reaſon of the Major ſeems to be, becauſe it is unreaſonable to conceive, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould do the greater and more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing, as <hi>viz.</hi> dye, for thoſe, for whom He is unwilling to do the leſs, <hi>viz.</hi> intercede.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If God intends and derees the Salvation of all Men by the Death of<note place="margin">13 Reaſon.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then it muſt needs follow, either that all Men are ſaved, or that God<note place="margin">Acta Synodi Dordr. part 2 p. 119</note> his Intentions and Decrees become fruſtrate, and attain not their end.</q> But neither of theſe are true: for, 1. Certain it is that all Men are not ſaved. 2. As certain it is, that Gods Intentions and Decrees never miſcarry, or fall ſhort of their ends: and to affirm this, is abſurd, yea blaſphemous. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the Counſel, Intention and Decree of the Father dyed<note place="margin">14 Reaſon.</note> for all Men, it will follow that there is neither an Election of any certain Perſons, nor a Reprobation of any. But there is both an Election of ſome<note place="margin">Acta Synodi Dordr. part 2 p. 119</note> certain Perſons, and a Reprobation of ſome others.</q> 
               <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Reaſon of the Major (becauſe I finde it not expreſſed) ſeems to be, becauſe it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Reaſon that God ſhould intend or decree to give His Son to dye for thoſe, whom He decreed to Reprobate [<hi>i. e.</hi> to leave in the hand of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perdition without all poſſibility of being ſaved] from Eternity. And if
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:94900:302"/> there be no Reprobation, there can be no Election, in as much as theſe do <hi>mutu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſeſe ponere, &amp; auferre.</hi> The Minor ſtands upon the Authority of the common Interpretations of ſuch Scriptures, which are commonly inſiſted on to prove ſuch an Election, and conſequently, a Reprobation correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it. All which Scriptures, at leaſt all ſuch of them which colour beſt with ſuch an Election, we ſhall (God willing) fairly examine upon the Point.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to the Intention and Counſel of the Father, hath<note place="margin">15 Reaſon.</note> ſuffered Death for all Men, then God ſhould ſtand equally, or indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected towards all Men, yea and ſaving Grace ſhould be univerſal.</q> But<note place="margin">Acta <hi>Synodi</hi> Dordr. part 2 p. 119</note> God doth not ſtand equally affected towards All Men, nor is ſaving Grace univerſal. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Conſequence is ſuppoſed authentique without Proof. The Minor is argued, 1. From the gratuitous Election of ſome. 2. From the like gratuitous Vocation of ſome, as of the Iſraelites, <hi>Deut. 4. 7. Pſal.</hi> 76. 1. 147. 20. 3. From the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not with others. 4. From the Myſtery of the Calling of the Gentiles. 5. (And laſtly) From that ſpecial Favor, Love, and Grace, wherewith God proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth His Elect.<note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all Men, and all Men be not ſaved, then is God not<note place="margin">16 Reaſon.</note> Omnipotent. But certain it is, 1. That all Men are not ſaved, and, 2. That God is Omnipotent.</q> 
               <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Minor needs no Proof, as to either part of<note place="margin">Acta <hi>Synodi</hi> Dordr. part 2 p. 120</note> it. The Reaſon of the Conſequence (in the Major) is, becauſe if Chriſt ſhould dye for all Men, it would follow that God ſhould be willing that ſuch a benefit ſhould be impetrated or procured for men, which He could not apply unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all Men, and all Men come not to be ſaved, then is the<note place="margin">17 Reaſon.</note> Wiſdom of God defective or imperfect.</q> But certain it is, 1. That all Men are not ſaved; 2. That the Wiſdom of God is not at all defective, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely<note place="margin">Acta <hi>Synodi</hi> Dordr. part 2 p. 120</note> perfect. <hi>Ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Chriſt dyed not for all Men. The Minor here alſo is preſumed (as well it may.) The Conſequence ſtands upon this ſuppoſition; That to fall ſhort in compaſſing, what a man intends, argues a deficiency in point of wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If Chriſt ſhould dye and make Satisfaction for all Men, and yet all Men<note place="margin">18 Reaſon.</note> not be ſaved, God ſhould be unjuſt, as <hi>viz.</hi> in receiving a full Satisfaction<note place="margin">Acta <hi>Synodi</hi> Dordr. part 2 p. 120</note> for men, and yet refuſing to receive them into favor, or to forgive them.</q> But certain it is, 1. That all Men are not ſaved: and, 2. That God is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt dyed not for all Men.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all Men, and all Men not come to be ſaved, then doth<note place="margin">19 Reaſon.</note> that great Love, out of which God gave his Son unto Men, vaniſh into an unprofitableneſs, or unuſefulneſs, in reſpect of men.</q> For to what purpoſe, or of what uſe is the Love of God in the gift of His Son unto men, if He<note place="margin">Acta <hi>Synodi</hi> Dordr. part 2 p. 120</note> doth not withall give them Faith in His Son? But certain it is, 1. That all Men come not to be ſaved; and, 2. That the great Love of God in the gift of his Son doth not vaniſh in unprofitableneſs. <hi>Ergo.</hi> A like Argument is fram'd upon the account of the great Love of the Son Himſelf towards thoſe for whom He dyed. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Argument) ſo loved us, that whileſt we were Enemies He dyed for us. Is it now credible that He ſhould not apply a benefit merited, or procured with ſo much ſweat, and with ſuch precious Blood, unto thoſe for whom He merited it?</p>
            <p>Theſe Arguments (with ſome Texts of Scripture, not here mentioned, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to prove ſome of the Particulars, together with ſome few Sayings from
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:94900:303"/> the Fathers, both which we intend to take and give knowledg of, upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) were (in a manner) the whole ſtrength, wherein the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> ſo much magnified themſelves againſt their Adverſaries, the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> in the traverſe of the ſecond Head of Matters Controverſal between them, which concerned the Intentions of God in, and about the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as far as I am able to obſerve from the Records of this Synod. Concerning which Arguments, I ſhall ſay no more at preſent, but onely theſe two things: 1. That though they be ſomewhat numerous, yet there is none of them but lieth very opportune and fair for Anſwer: and, 2. That ſome of them (if not the greater part) ſtand bent againſt ſuch an Opinion, which (I beleeve) their Antagoniſts did not hold: certain I am, they do not oppugn that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Redemption, which is maintained in this Book. Nevertheleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may poſſibly be conceived by ſome (leſs conſiderate) to riſe up with much ſtrength againſt it, we ſhall take them into conſideration reſpectively in their places. I will not ſay that there have been ſufficient grounds layd (yea and ſufficiently proved) in the Premiſſes of our preſent Diſcourſe, whereon to frame ſatisfactory Anſwers even to thoſe that are counted Pillars amongſt them; but ſhall leave the conſideration hereof to the intelligent and unpartial Reader, and to the Diſquiſitions about them intended in the ſecond Part of this Work.</p>
            <p>I do not meet with any thing of moment in any other Author to infringe<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> the credit of the Doctrine of General Redemption, which doth not make one ſpirit with one or other of the Arguments levyed (as we have heard) by the ſaid Synod. This which I ſhall preſently recite from the Collocutors of the Contra-Remonſtrancy at the Conference at the <hi>Hague, Ann.</hi> 1613. is but the ſame (in effect) with the firſt and fifth of thoſe uſed by the <hi>Synod.</hi> 
               <q>For whom ſoever <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed, and obtained Remiſſion of ſins, and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, for theſe alſo He obtained by his Death Deliverance from the bondage of ſin, and the ſpirit of Regeneration for Newneſs of life:</q> But <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not obtain Deliverance from the bondage of ſin, or the ſpirit of Regeneration, for all Men. <hi>Ergo.</hi> If any man conceives there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in this Argument of the ſaid Collocutors, which I ſhall next tranſcribe, then in any of the former, I am content that it ſhall ſtand, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional unto them. I finde it in this form:</p>
            <p>
               <q>All they for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed, can freely ſay, <hi>Who is he that condemneth?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">20 Reaſon.</note> 
                  <hi>It is Chriſt that dyed for us:</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. But they are onely Beleevers, and the Elect, that can ſpeak thus: Verſ. 33. not Unbeleevers, <hi>Mark 16. 16. Ergo.</hi> The Minor is further ſtrengthened by this conſideration: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, raiſed from the conſideration of the Death of Chriſt, which the Apoſtle here [<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32, 33, &amp;c.] adminiſtreth unto the Saints, or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, would have little ſolidity or worth in it, in caſe Reprobates and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers could as truly ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for them alſo.</p>
            <p>This Argument likewiſe from the ſame Authors, is vertually contained in that already mentioned in the fifteenth place. Yet let it have the Honor of an Argument by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If Reconciliation with God and Remiſſion of ſins be obtained for all and<note place="margin">21 Reaſon.</note> every man, none excepted, then ſhould [or, ought] the Word of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation [<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi>] be preached [or, declared] and this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, to all and every man.</q> But the Word of Reconciliation is not thus preached to all and every man. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Reaſon of the Conſequence, is, becauſe they, for whom Reconciliation is obtained, not being capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:94900:303"/> it but by Faith, and Faith not being to be obtained but by hearing [the Word of this their Reconciliation,] it ſeems contrary to all Reaſon that they ſhould be deprived of the means of beleeving.</p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Chamier</hi> advanceth this Argument againſt us (the ſtrength<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>The Scriptures and Arguments now propounded, are the effect and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> of all that I can readily finde (or call to minde) pleaded and argued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrine of General Redemption, as it hath been ſtated, and aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our preſent Diſcourſe, excepting onely ſome quotations from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If any thing of moment upon the ſame account ſhall further occur, or be offered unto me, either before, or under my examination of theſe, I ſhall not conceal it: but ſhall, as in the preſence of God, and without the leaſt touch or tincture of prejudice or partiality, acknowledg ſtrength in any thing, where I apprehend ſtrength, and ſhew all ſubmiſſive reverence to that which is above me. Yea God knoweth, that one Reaſon moving me to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit beforehand, in the cloſe of this firſt part, a Particular of matters to be handled in the ſecond, was, that in caſe any Friend of the contrary Doctrine conceives that he hath ſomewhat more pregnant or convincing, on the behalf of his Opinion, either from the Scriptures, or otherwiſe, then any thing that I have yet taken into conſideration, or intend to give ſatisfaction unto, he might have the opportunity of repreſenting the ſame, either privately unto me, if he pleaſe, or otherwiſe publiquely unto the World.</p>
            <p>By occaſion of the Objection or Argument mentioned in the fourteenth place, we ſhall, by way of Digreſſion, lanch forth into the deep of the Great Queſtion concerning Perſonal Election and Reprobation: and ſoberly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether the Scriptures do any where hold forth, or teach any ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation in God from Eternity, whereby the perſons of ſuch and ſuch men, or of ſuch a determinate number of men, before any actual or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſin perpetrated by them, and without any reſpect had to ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrations, be decreed by him, to be left under an unavoydable neceſſity of periſhing everlaſtingly. Here alſo, we intend tenderly to enquire what the
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:94900:304"/> Scripture teacheth concerning the Eſtate of Infants: and more particularly, whether it can be ſubſtantially proved from them, that any Infant, or Infants whatſoever, dying before the commiſſion of Actual Sin, are adjudged by God unto Hell fire.</p>
            <p>In my Anſwer to the Argument propounded in the fifteenth place, I ſhall take occaſion (digreſſion-wiſe alſo) to enquire into, and diſcuſs the Great Queſtion about Univerſal Grace; <hi>viz.</hi> whether God vouchſafeth not unto all Men without exception, a ſufficiency of power or means, whereby to be ſaved. Within the verge of this Debate we ſhall modeſtly enquire, whether God doth not vouchſafe unto all Men, the ſame, or a like ſufficiency (at leaſt in a Geometrical proportion) of means, whereby to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And becauſe, amongſt other Scriptures, the nineth Chapter of the Epiſtle<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> to the <hi>Romans</hi> is frequently, and this in very many places and paſſages of it, brought upon the Stage of theſe Controverſies and Diſputes, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſuppoſed to deliver impregnable grounds for ſuch a perſonal Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reprobation, which we apprehend the Scriptures generally, yea and in this very Chapter, as plainly to oppoſe, as many men do confidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch; we therefore intend a particular and entire Explication of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by it ſelf. Yea I am under ſome preſent inclination of thoughts, to engage upon this in the firſt place, and to publiſh it by it ſelf, before I put hand to the greater Work. But in this, I ſhall willingly be determined by the advice of Friends.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Teſtimonies of the Fathers uſually produced in way of diſcountenance to the avouched Doctrine of this Diſcourſe, I judg the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of them no ways neceſſary, until we come to give Anſwers unto them: and therefore ſhall not encumber the Readers Patience with them here. Unto whom, in ſtead thereof, I ſhall addreſs my ſelf in this double Requeſt: 1. That he will pleaſe ſo far to comport with his own Intereſt, and mine, as to ſtrive by fervent and frequent Prayer, to intereſs God himſelf in the Compoſure of the Work intended, that through much of his preſence with me in the framing and enditing of it, (if yet his good pleaſure ſhall be not to judg a proportion of life and health for the finiſhing of it, too high a dignation for me) all my inſufficiency for ſo great an Undertaking may be drowned, ſo as not to appear, in one kinde or other, to the loſs or diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of any man, that ſhall pleaſe to beſtow his time in the Peruſal of it, or of any part of it: and that I may be enabled from on high to bring forth the Truth in thoſe high Myſteries, which I ſhall be occaſioned to ſearch into therein, out of that thick Darkneſs, which at preſent is ſpred by men round about them, into a clear and perfect Light, that ſo they may become more ſavory, more wholeſom, and better-prepared nouriſhment for the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Conſciences of the generality of men amongſt us, then they have proved hitherto. My ſecond Requeſt to the Reader (with which I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him at the preſent) is, that he will make ſuch a Covenant with his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations and Deſires as not to look for the publiſhing of the ſecond Part of this Work, till after ſuch a time, which may be reaſonably judged compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for a man of a ſlow <hi>genius</hi> in writing on the one hand, and of (almoſt) continual diverſions through by-employments on the other hand, to raiſe and finiſh ſuch a Building, as that in Reaſon may be preſumed to be.</p>

               <item>1. <hi>IT is frequent in Scripture to expreſs a thing after the manner of an Event, or Conſequent, which ſhall, or will follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch, or ſuch an occaſion, or means, ſome ways likely to produce it, which yet fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cometh not to paſs: nay the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereunto many times follows, and comes to paſs in ſtead thereof.</hi> Pag. 216, 221, 234</item>
